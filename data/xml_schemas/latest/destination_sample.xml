			<section>
				<title>Considering the City</title>
				<description>Living in Dubai has much to offer. The sun shines almost every day, the shopping and leisure facilities are impressive, and the salaries are tax-free. Of course, there are hassles and annoyances, but for many these are outweighed by the positives.</description>

			<section>
				<title>Before You Arrive</title>
				<description>If you’re coming to Dubai to work, or even just to look for work, you should have any qualification certificates and important documents (such as your marriage certificate, and kids’ birth certificates) attested in your home country. This can be quite a lengthy process, and involves solicitors and the UAE foreign embassy.</description>

				<title>Heritage Sites</title>
				<description>Old Dubai features many fascinating places to visit, all of which offer glimpses into the past when the city was nothing more than a small fishing and trading port. Many of the pre-oil heritage sites have been carefully restored, paying close attention to traditional design and using original building materials. Take an ambient stroll through the Bastakiya area, characterised by the many distinctive windtowers, and marvel at how anyone could have survived in Dubai before air-conditioning. Aside from Dubai, many other areas also offer history fans opportunities to learn more about the region’s fascinating past.</description>
