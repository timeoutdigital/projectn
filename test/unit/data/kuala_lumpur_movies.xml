<strong>Chemman Chaalai (The Gravel Road)</strong><br />
- Chemman Chaalai is a drama set in the 1960s in a rubber estate in Malaysia. The story revolves around Shanta and her rubber tappers family living in the estate.

Malaysian Indians have little control on the economy and politics in Malaysia. A way forward would be education. The film emphases the importance of education for the growth of the community and nation.<br />

<strong>Chalanggai (Dancing Bells)</strong><br />
- Uma lives with her mother, Muniammah, and elder brother Siva, in a soon to be demolished neighborhood secluded in the backyards of the rapidly developing Brickfields. Chalanggai is a beautifully realistic and detailed portrait of a family that has to survive and above all has to maintain its dignity. The film was shot entirely on location in Brickfield and the cast is made up of local amateurs.</p>]]></descripton>
