"","","","","","","The crowds haven&#146;t thinned at Nobu since the place opened 12 years ago, so it only made sense when owner Drew Nieporent introduced this midtown branch. David Rockwell, who designed the original and its sidekick, crafted a spectacular showcase for Nobu Matsuhisa&#146;s famed Latin-tinged sushi: There&#146;s a 10,000-square-foot dining room with banquettes made from Japanese fishing materials and a 12-seat hibachi-and-<em>shabu-shabu</em> station. Best of all, the place seats hundreds of diners, which means you might actually be able to get a reservation.<br/><br/><a href=/articles/restaurants-bars/8592/top-of-the-food-chain>Read Randall Lane's full review of Nobu 57</a>","Good for large groupsFull barPower mealsTrendyVegetarian-friendlyDate placeNotable chefTourist spotReservations requiredConversation-friendlyTakeoutCateringPrivate roomsClassic NYNo steps at entranceNotable wine listNYCVisit: Power brokerNYCVisit: Glamour houndNYCVisit: Trendsetter","AmEx, DC, Disc, MC, V","AmEx, DC, MC, V","","","","","","","AmEx, DC, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","yes","","Midtown West","Tribeca","","","","","","","Tribeca","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu 5:45&#8211;10:15pm; Fri, Sat 5:45&#8211;11:15pm; Sun 5:45&#8211;10:15pm","Mon&#8211;Thu 5:45pm&#8211;midnight; Fri, Sat 5:45pm&#8211;1am; Sun 5:45&#8211;11pm","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Fri 11:45am&#8211;2:15pm, 5:45&#8211;10:15pm; Sat, Sun 5:45&#8211;10:15pm","","","","","","","","1003","105 Hudson St at Franklin St","","","","","","","105 Hudson St at Franklin St","","","","","","","","40 W 57th St between Fifth and Sixth Aves","Nobu 57	","Next Door Nobu","","","","","","","Nobu","","","","","","","","","212-757-3000","212-334-4445","","","","","","","212-219-0500","","","","","","","","Average hot dish: $25.

"","","","","","","Keith McNally has been trying for years to replicate what Raoul&#146;s has been doing since 1975&#151;serving first-rate French fare in an authentic bistro setting. Raoul&#146;s timeworn look is the real deal: Authentic antique furnishings, pressed-tin ceilings and walls, black-and-white leather booths, and paintings of female nudes beckon. The food is as seductive as the atmosphere. <em>Magret</em> duck breast is sliced and served over kale and carrot puree, and a thick, charred cut of sirloin smothered in black-peppercorn sauce is tender enough to erase any comers from your memory.","Date placeReservations requiredFull barPrivate roomsTrendyGarden seatingGood for large groupsClassic NYDining at barBar sceneConversation-friendlyTakeoutDessert placeNYCVisit: RomanticNYCVisit: Glamour houndNYCVisit: Culture buffLate night","AmEx, DC, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","yes","","Soho","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Daily 5pm&#8211;1am","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1009","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","180 Prince St between Sullivan and Thompson Sts","Raoul&#146;s","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-966-3518","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","French: $25 and up","","Subway: C, E to Spring St; N, R to Prince St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ebarr","x","7/15/2004","212-966-3518","Raw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit inReady to galleyFact check in","","10012","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$$","Raouls","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.raouls.com",""

You may have to wait in line for a good hour to get your hands on one (and you will need both hands). Fortunately, several $2.50 drafts (including McSorley&#146;s Ale) will help you bide your time, as will the Yankees on the tube, and a jukebox that plays everything from Calexico to Coltrane. Go for the Bistro Burger, a fat patty of broiled beef, cheese and smoky bacon on a sesame-seed bun for $6.75. A plate of crisp shoestring fries will run you $2.50, but they&#146;re totally beside the point.","TakeoutSmoking accommodatedFull barNo steps at entranceTourist spotDining at barWheelchair accessible bathroomSolo diningNYCVisit: TrendsetterNYCVisit: ExplorerNYCVisit: Culture buffBar sceneLate night","Cash only","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","yes","","West Village","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Sat 11:30am&#8211;4am; Sun noon&#8211;4am","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1012","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","331 W 4th St at Jane St","Corner Bistro","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-242-9502","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average burger: $6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American: $15 and less","","Subway: A, C, E to 14th St; L to Eighth Ave","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","yes","ebarr","","6/9/2004","212-242-9502","Fact check inRaw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit inReady to galley","","10014","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","CornerBistro","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
