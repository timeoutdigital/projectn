The all-Spanish staff take enormous pride in their sherry bar, and with good reason: the selection encompasses every style of these often neglected wines, and every one on the list is a cracker. 

Customers perch on high stools at the tiny tables and waiters come to offer whatever guidance is needed. If you don't know your way around sherry, place yourself in their hands. Taster glasses  are offered to the uncertain. The tapas are jaw-droppingly good too, with the olives, cured pork and cheeses all five-star stuff. Tortas de barros, a creamy sheep's milk cheese from Estremadura, is served with tomato jam to fabulous effect. 

Sitting in Bar Pepito is like being in Spain, yet the grimy hubbub of Kings Cross is a 30-second walk away. When we visited, Many of the customers were Spanish: follow their lead.
