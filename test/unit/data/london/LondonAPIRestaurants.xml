You'd never know it from the difficulty involved in  getting a dinner table at Polpetto, the new Italian restaurant above the French House in Soho. As Polpetto takes no bookings - convenient for the restaurateur, much less convenient for potential diners - it took me three attempts and increasingly early visits to bag a table. We sat near the entrance, hemmed in by boisterously self-satisfied diners on all sides, and watched a succession of disappointed diners being turned away at the door. 

Why is Polpetto so busy? A number of reasons, not the least being that it's tiny, with only has 28 seats. The location in a dining room above the French House, one of the most characterful bars in central Soho, certainly helps. But most of all, its older sibling, Polpo, has been a huge success since it opened in October 2009. And with nearly 1,800 followers on Twitter, plus bloggers visiting during the soft opening ('friends and guests only' I was told), Polpo had no difficulty in getting the word out about the new branch.  

Polpetto is similar to Polpo in many ways. It feigns the rustic look with nineteenth-century French light fittings, zinc-topped tables, bronze-coloured tin ceiling and bare filament light bulbs which all enhance the patina of the place. It looks terrific, in a New York West Village sort of way. 

Polpetto also serves smallish portions of dishes in the style of a Venetian bacaro (wine bar). Some of these are more robust portions, such as veal shank (ossobuco) with saffron rice, while other mirror the smaller cicheti ('tapas') you might find in Venice, such as a simple toast (crostini) topped with chicken liver pâté. Wine is served in 250ml carafes, decanted into glasses the size of eye-rinse cups.
 
The attraction of a place like Polpetto is undoubtedly the buzz - our fellow diners, many of them Soho media types, were dressed up and in party mood. But the food should also live up to the promise, and our meal was patchier than we'd have hoped for. 

A dish of prawns in a chilli and tomato sauce would have been better if the prawns had been deveined, and you can get a better cherry tart - like a French clafoutis - at the Curzon cinema just around the corner. More appealing, though, was a simple salad of finely cut fennel with mint, ricotta and peas.
 
Polpetto's more than just a clone of the Polpo menu though. Chef Tom Oldroyd - chef at both operations - is playing with new dishes, such as the dessert called sgroppino, which resembles a glass of melting slush flavoured with lemon (the advertised strawberry seemed absent). 

Polpetto is merely the second venture that owner Russell Norman has opened in Soho. The third, called Spuntino, will be even smaller and you can guarantee it will be rammed from the first week too. You can, of course, follow progress on its opening via Twitter. </description><lat>51.512668</lat><lng>-0.131684</lng><starRating>3</starRating><tags/><webUrl>http://www.timeout.com/london/restaurants/reviews/2:27894.html</webUrl><details><detail name="Good for">Hip factor</detail><detail name="Price band">Mid-range</detail></details><userRating total="0"><criteria><name score="">Originality</name></criteria><criteria><name score="">Enjoyment</name></criteria><criteria><name score="">Quality</name></criteria><criteria><name score="">Value for money</name></criteria></userRating></row></response>
