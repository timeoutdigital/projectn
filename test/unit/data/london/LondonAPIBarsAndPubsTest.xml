      <description>Forget Ryanair: Santa Maria is the thinking food-lovers' mini-break. Closer to London than the airport, cheaper than check-in charges, and with pizzas as authentic as any in Italy. 

    Neopolitan owners Pasquale Chionchio and Angelo Ambrosio brought the produce they love with them when they opened their cosy, eight-table pizzeria in February 2010. Fresh, quality ingredients are at the forefront of their first venture. Braids of garlic and dried chillies spill from the wooden crates nailed like shelves to the whitewashed walls. A brightly coloured mosaic of Saint Mary (the name of the street Santa Maria occupies) watches over the customers - an ever-changing throng of Italians, their bambini, and locals who can't believe their luck. 

    We waited briefly for a table, Peroni in hand, on the pizzeria's tiny terrace (as most people who don't take advantage of its takeaway service do), watching the children inside run around the table legs and have their hair ruffled by the passing owners.

    No one waits too long to be fed here, and once seated in the inner sanctum, we were treated to the same fast, friendly service. Our pizzas materialised almost immediately, the superior fior di latte on the margherita blending creamily into its fresh tomato sauce, a result of a precise 90-second blast in the 400C wood-burning oven. A query about specialities earned us an off-menu Napoli; the quality of its plump, strident capers, intensely savoury anchovies, cherry tomatoes, black olives and fragrant fresh herbs shone brightly. Both pizzas had crisp, billowing cornicioni and springy, evenly cooked crusts that begged to be folded and eaten by hand, Italian style. 

    The dough was so light we could have squeezed in another pizza between us - according to Pasquale, many people do just that, and it's hardly surprising given that two pizzas here cost as much as just one can in central London. Instead, we enjoyed a scoop of milk-rich, artisanal hazelnut gelato, carefully sourced from South Kensington institution Oddono's, and a bracing shot of amaretto.

    Santa Maria is bursting with good atmosphere, a result of its relaxed jazz music, the boisterous chat and proximity of its customers, and the good feeling emanating from its owners, who are rightly confident of their unpretentious but spot-on offering and clearly having fun at the same time. We were happy to sit and soak up the experience for longer, but expectant pilgrims were forming a queue outside, so we stepped out of this pocket of Italy and back into the drizzly suburbs.   (review by Nicky Evans) 

    PS Santa Maria currently take bookings during the week for its 8 tables - but it's first-come, first-served basis at weekends.
