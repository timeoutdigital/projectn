				<description><![CDATA[Following a disastrous incursion into bubblegum high-school romance territory (&#145;I Love You, Beth Cooper&#146;), Chris Columbus, director of the first two &#145;Harry Potters&#146;, returns to his comfort zone for this episodic and mirthless fantasy saga based on the first of a series of fantasy books by US writer Rick Riordan. <br />
<br />
Mulching together the angsty teen intrigue of &#145;Harry Potter&#146; and the frigid-and-proud flagwaving of &#145;Twilight&#146;, the film sees Zac Efron lookalike Logan Lerman (&#145;Gamer&#146;) playing an underachiever who turns out to be a sword-swinging demigod when he discovers his birth was the result of the god Poseidon (Kevin McKidd) having a quick fling with dowdy New York housewife Catherine Keener. When his mother is kidnapped by Hades (Steve Coogan in full &#145;Saxondale&#146; mode) as a bargaining chip for Zeus&#146;s lost lightning bolt, Percy is charged with finding a number of trinkets dotted across North America in order to avert a crisis on Mount Olympus (located just above the New York cloud cover, who knew?) and save mom from eternal damnation.  <br />
<br />
That Percy risks life and limb to preserve the family unit is typical Columbus, and the film works best when playing on the idea that no amount of bravado is enough to mask our desire for parental love. Yet it&#146;s not enough to compensate for the computer-game-style plotting, which is largely based on us picking up narrative nuggets that mechanically slot into place later on. Problematic, too, is the product placement: witness the scene in which Percy battles Medusa (Uma Thurman) and avoids her deathly gaze by craftily using the shiny back of his iPod as a mirror. <em>David Jenkins</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Although far better than its troubled history lead one to fear, this gory, gothic take on the classic lycanthropic love story has had its romantic heart ripped out. Returning to his estranged father&#146;s crumbling pile in 1891 &#150; to investigate his brother&#146;s disappearance &#150; actor Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) falls for his dead sibling&#146;s mourning fianc&#233;e, Gwen (Emily Blunt). But before this spark of love can ignite, Lawrence is bitten by the lunar-tic creature the locals fear, and must confront the beast buried within himself. With its mist-shrouded sets, gruesome slaughter and copious CGI, this is a surprisingly respectful updating of the 1941 Universal original. Thanks to Rick Baker&#146;s make-up effects, Del Toro&#146;s transformations from handsome lover to hairy, howling beast are frighteningly convincing; Anthony Hopkins is restrained as his emotionally detached father; and a cruelly underused Blunt is all-a-quiver as the beautiful, bereaved Gwen. Ultimately, though, neither Joe Johnston&#146;s efficient direction nor Danny Elfman&#146;s hard-working score can lift the familiar storyline out of the ordinary. <em>Nigel Floyd</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Anyone heading to the cinema this February 14 will find themselves conspicuously catered for by this romantic comedy from veteran Garry Marshall (&#145;Pretty Woman&#146;, &#145;Beaches&#146;). Throwing out a net to everyone from back-row teenage saliva-swappers to seasoned seniors, the film feels like it has been coldly calculated to hoover up demographics. How? Marshall gives his rom-com the Robert Altman &#145;Short Cuts&#146; treatment: an enormous megawatt ensemble cast appear in a dozen or so interlocking lurve stories that play out on Valentine&#146;s Day in Los Angeles. It&#146;s supremely efficient and utterly ruthless.<br />
<br />
There are 19 all-star names above the title (in alphabetical order, naturally) but the lead belongs to Ashton Kutcher. A nice-guy florist, he proposes to his work-addict girlfriend (Jessica Alba), but is obviously much better suited to his teacher best friend (Jennifer Garner). Jessica Biel (is it me, or are the Jessicas interchangeable?) plays a neurotically single sports publicist. Anne Hathaway, an office temp who moonlights as a phone sex operator (little nod to &#145;Short Cuts&#146; there), hasn&#146;t told her new boyfriend about the sideline. Shirley MacLaine, happily married for 50 years, is keeping an old secret from her husband. In what reeks of final-draft add-on, country star Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner from &#145;The Twilight Saga&#146; pair up as school sweethearts: no actual storyline here, but they tick the pre-teen box big time.  <br />
<br />
These are sassily-scripted but glossy, vacuous fantasies &#150; with the exception of Julia Roberts&#146;s army captain, who&#146;s on short leave from Iraq and meets a guy (Bradley Cooper) on a plane: after some sparky but non-committal flight banter they go their separate ways and both their tales resolve with unexpectedly lovely flourishes. Their stories make the rest of the film look like it&#146;s got a cold, shiny cash register right where its heart should be. <em>Cath Clarke</em>]]></description>
