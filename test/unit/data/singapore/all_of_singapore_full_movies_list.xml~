				<title>Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief</title>

				<description><![CDATA[Following a disastrous incursion into bubblegum high-school romance territory (&#145;I Love You, Beth Cooper&#146;), Chris Columbus, director of the first two &#145;Harry Potters&#146;, returns to his comfort zone for this episodic and mirthless fantasy saga based on the first of a series of fantasy books by US writer Rick Riordan. <br />
<br />
Mulching together the angsty teen intrigue of &#145;Harry Potter&#146; and the frigid-and-proud flagwaving of &#145;Twilight&#146;, the film sees Zac Efron lookalike Logan Lerman (&#145;Gamer&#146;) playing an underachiever who turns out to be a sword-swinging demigod when he discovers his birth was the result of the god Poseidon (Kevin McKidd) having a quick fling with dowdy New York housewife Catherine Keener. When his mother is kidnapped by Hades (Steve Coogan in full &#145;Saxondale&#146; mode) as a bargaining chip for Zeus&#146;s lost lightning bolt, Percy is charged with finding a number of trinkets dotted across North America in order to avert a crisis on Mount Olympus (located just above the New York cloud cover, who knew?) and save mom from eternal damnation.  <br />
<br />
That Percy risks life and limb to preserve the family unit is typical Columbus, and the film works best when playing on the idea that no amount of bravado is enough to mask our desire for parental love. Yet it&#146;s not enough to compensate for the computer-game-style plotting, which is largely based on us picking up narrative nuggets that mechanically slot into place later on. Problematic, too, is the product placement: witness the scene in which Percy battles Medusa (Uma Thurman) and avoids her deathly gaze by craftily using the shiny back of his iPod as a mirror. <em>David Jenkins</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Although far better than its troubled history lead one to fear, this gory, gothic take on the classic lycanthropic love story has had its romantic heart ripped out. Returning to his estranged father&#146;s crumbling pile in 1891 &#150; to investigate his brother&#146;s disappearance &#150; actor Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) falls for his dead sibling&#146;s mourning fianc&#233;e, Gwen (Emily Blunt). But before this spark of love can ignite, Lawrence is bitten by the lunar-tic creature the locals fear, and must confront the beast buried within himself. With its mist-shrouded sets, gruesome slaughter and copious CGI, this is a surprisingly respectful updating of the 1941 Universal original. Thanks to Rick Baker&#146;s make-up effects, Del Toro&#146;s transformations from handsome lover to hairy, howling beast are frighteningly convincing; Anthony Hopkins is restrained as his emotionally detached father; and a cruelly underused Blunt is all-a-quiver as the beautiful, bereaved Gwen. Ultimately, though, neither Joe Johnston&#146;s efficient direction nor Danny Elfman&#146;s hard-working score can lift the familiar storyline out of the ordinary. <em>Nigel Floyd</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Anyone heading to the cinema this February 14 will find themselves conspicuously catered for by this romantic comedy from veteran Garry Marshall (&#145;Pretty Woman&#146;, &#145;Beaches&#146;). Throwing out a net to everyone from back-row teenage saliva-swappers to seasoned seniors, the film feels like it has been coldly calculated to hoover up demographics. How? Marshall gives his rom-com the Robert Altman &#145;Short Cuts&#146; treatment: an enormous megawatt ensemble cast appear in a dozen or so interlocking lurve stories that play out on Valentine&#146;s Day in Los Angeles. It&#146;s supremely efficient and utterly ruthless.<br />
<br />
There are 19 all-star names above the title (in alphabetical order, naturally) but the lead belongs to Ashton Kutcher. A nice-guy florist, he proposes to his work-addict girlfriend (Jessica Alba), but is obviously much better suited to his teacher best friend (Jennifer Garner). Jessica Biel (is it me, or are the Jessicas interchangeable?) plays a neurotically single sports publicist. Anne Hathaway, an office temp who moonlights as a phone sex operator (little nod to &#145;Short Cuts&#146; there), hasn&#146;t told her new boyfriend about the sideline. Shirley MacLaine, happily married for 50 years, is keeping an old secret from her husband. In what reeks of final-draft add-on, country star Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner from &#145;The Twilight Saga&#146; pair up as school sweethearts: no actual storyline here, but they tick the pre-teen box big time.  <br />
<br />
These are sassily-scripted but glossy, vacuous fantasies &#150; with the exception of Julia Roberts&#146;s army captain, who&#146;s on short leave from Iraq and meets a guy (Bradley Cooper) on a plane: after some sparky but non-committal flight banter they go their separate ways and both their tales resolve with unexpectedly lovely flourishes. Their stories make the rest of the film look like it&#146;s got a cold, shiny cash register right where its heart should be. <em>Cath Clarke</em>]]></description>

				<title>Crazy Heart</title>

				<description><![CDATA[Jeff Bridges, for all his glorious achievements, still hasn&#146;t been celebrated enough. A technical actor (remember <em>Starman</em>?) who manages to make every gesture a perfect one, he&#146;s been paired with difficult material over a meandering career and always succeeded. So if this better-than-average country-singer tale does the trick come Oscar time, here&#146;s someone who won&#146;t complain. <br />
<br />
&#147;Bad&#148; Blake, much like Bridges&#146;s immortal Dude, is belly-acting: gutsy and, well, big-gutted. The number of times Blake is seen emerging from a pickup truck with his belt unfastened is almost a running joke. Rambling through a series of Texas bars and vomiting behind them, Blake is haunted by a musical prot&#233;g&#233; who&#146;s become a huge star (Farrell). His own glory days are long behind him.  <br />
<br />
<em>Crazy Heart</em> pairs this fascinating private strummer with a curious journalist (Gyllenhaal), who soon shares with him a bed and the affections of her daddyless young son. For the movie&#146;s first hour, you perk up at the vibrations of sympathetic emotions, pitched at a quiet frequency not heard since Tender Mercies. (The appearance of Robert Duvall is a bonus.) Upsettingly, though, someone&#146;s decided that such intimate moments are not enough for a night of entertainment, so a manufactured kid-in-jeopardy climax and Blake&#146;s rehab stint blow the mood. Until then, this is great American acting.<em> Joshua Rothkopf</em>]]></description>

				<link>http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/xmlapi/xml_detail/?movie=754&amp;key=ffab6a24c60f562ecf705130a36c1d1e</link>

				<description><![CDATA[Not a great deal happens in &#145;Bright Star&#146;, Jane Campion&#146;s breezy and beautiful film about the nineteenth-century British poet John Keats (played by Ben Whishaw). The New Zealand director&#146;s film is light in the most attractive and dreamy of ways: it floats on its own, intimately explored love story and refuses to be weighed down by either period fixtures and fittings or the later reputation of Keats, whose final years and stalling romance with his neighbour Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish) Campion handles with a smartness and sensitivity that feel teasingly throwaway.<br />
<br />
That&#146;s not to say there&#146;s anything slapdash about Campion&#146;s story of how Keats moved in next door to the fatherless Brawne family and fell in love with slightly younger Fanny, tentatively courting her and writing her wonderfully honest letters but fatally kept at a distance by poverty and illness. In fact, for this critic, it&#146;s the exquisite detail of the whole affair, coupled with the aerating winds of modernity that blow gently through the film, rather than the emotional pull of the doomed love affair at its heart, that are the film&#146;s real success. (Others, I must say, differ on this point, judging by the sobs and sniffles to my left and right at the London Film Festival screening of the film.) <br />
<br />
A combination of unstuffy dialogue, wise casting, unselfconscious performances and sensuous but never pretty photography makes Campion&#146;s version of the nineteenth century feel current but not anachronistic.<br />
<br />
Campion came to Keats&#146;s story, which she shot in Britain last year, after a four-year sabbatical from filmmaking &#150; and it shows, especially following the dark, oppressive atmosphere of &#145;In the Cut&#146;, one of her least successful films. Her telling of this biographical tale, inspired by Andrew Motion&#146;s biography, feels as if it&#146;s told by someone with much knowledge but little weight on their shoulders. It&#146;s a feeling one gets from the performances too, especially from Cornish and Whishaw, who both, at times, threaten to float off on a cloud of their characters&#146; distraction. It&#146;s down to the side players, especially an earthy Kerry Fox as Fanny&#146;s mother and a boisterous Paul Schneider as Keats&#146;s friend and protector Charles Brown, to give the film some vim away from the fog of love. Whishaw, with his troubled air and vulnerable features, is perhaps better as a Romantic lead than a romantic one, and if the film has one crucial failing, it&#146;s that there&#146;s a crucial spark missing between Whishaw and Cornish. <br />
<br />
Campion treats Keats&#146;s talent as a given and not a cue for creaky explorations of inspiration and artistic otherness. She weaves his poetry into the drama, calling for it to be spoken naturally and not at all awkwardly by her characters. It&#146;s not easy to follow verse this way, but it certainly inspires the viewer to head straight from the cinema to the bookshop. <em>Dave Calhoun</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Best wipe &#145;8 1/2&#146; from your mind, or at least delay seeing Fellini&#146;s loopy masterpiece, if you&#146;re going to enjoy this angsty romp through the director&#146;s 1963 film about a fictional Italian filmmaker, Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis), who loses his mojo and might be about to lose his marbles and his marriage.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, though, there&#146;s lots in this musical version, itself an adaptation of a 1980s Broadway show, that relates to the sombre heart of Fellini&#146;s original. We still get Guido&#146;s formative childhood memory of watching a prostitute perform on the beach (although this time it is Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas brilliantly belting out the film&#146;s foot-tapping anthem &#145;Be Italian&#146;). We also get the lingering ghost of his mother (Sophia Loren!), the pain of his adultery and the madness of his creative impasse. Also, Fellini&#146;s meshing of dream and reality is oddly suited to the unreal tendencies of a musical, although it&#146;s anybody&#146;s guess what the director would have made of Pen&#233;lope Cruz throwing herself around in stockings and suspenders and upping the sex factor beyond anything Claudia Cardinale offered in the original.<br />
<br />
The biggest difference, though, is that almost 50 years later, director Rob Marshall (&#145;Chicago&#146;) is able to play the story of &#145;8 1/2&#146; as a nostalgia piece. He fetishises the look and feel of 1960s Italy and especially Rome so that the film&#146;s mood of artistic melancholia is expressed on a canvas that comes dangerously close to looking like an ad for Italian coffee. Marshall and his writers, including the late Anthony Minghella, also stress the humour of Guido&#146;s philandering, often preferring that his inner turmoil goes no further than chain-smoking. To give Day-Lewis his due, the actor grounds the film&#146;s sillier tendencies in a charming performance of mercurial despair. He&#146;s well supported by Marion Cotillard, who conveys the sadness of being&#160; Guido&#146;s wife, although both Nicole Kidman as his leading lady and Kate Hudson as an admiring journalist are little more than window-dressing. <em>Dave Calhoun</em>]]></description>

Terry Gilliam&#146;s struggle to bring Heath Ledger&#146;s last performance to the screen was laudable: he rallied a crack crew of A-listers (Depp, Law and Farrell) to essay enigmatic variations on their fallen comrade, all the while struggling with his own grief at the loss of a friend.
But there&#146;s no escaping the fact that the completed film, though lovingly made, is something of a mess. Set in a stark contemporary London, it&#146;s a patronising elegy for the death of the public imagination, as personified by Christopher Plummer&#146;s Parnassus, a travelling teller of tall tales whose audience is progressively shrinking. Ledger excels as snake-tongued amnesiac Tony Liar, who hops aboard the ramshackle Imaginarium and begins to charm punters with his raffish air of money-grubbing mischief. But his performance &#150; the film&#146;s trump card &#150; is repeatedly elbowed out by a centuries- spanning duel between Parnassus and Tom Waits&#146; cigar-chomping Satan, told in garish CG flashbacks. It&#146;s telling that Parnassus, an unsubtle proxy for the director, never recognises his own culpability as his audience&#146;s interest dwindles: it&#146;s modern man&#146;s refusal to open his mind, not the artist&#146;s unwillingness to connect, that dooms the Imaginarium. It&#146;s unlikely Gilliam&#146;s own, undeniably brilliant career will be revitalised by this rambling, undisciplined and indulgent piece of work.

				<description><![CDATA[Vampirism is the new monstrosity <em>du jour</em>, and in this adaptation of Darren Shan&#146;s teen-lit novel, tweener boys get their own testosterone-infused variant of <em>Twilight</em>. Paul Weitz&#146;s comedyhorror saga charts the coming-of-age odyssey of Darren (Massoglia), a goody-two-shoes high-schooler who agrees to become half-vampire to save his best friend (Hutcherson). The Count responsible for Darren&#146;s transformation is Larten Crepsley (Reilly, depressingly featureless), who works in the world&#146;s oldest freak show and leads a faction of the bloodsucking undead.
Crepsley&#146;s at odds with a murderous fanged gang of rivals, though given the film&#146;s chintzy special effects, dreary adolescent drama and general dearth of imagination &#150; the troupe&#146;s main attractions are a dull snake boy and a bearded Salma Hayek &#150; the most prominent emotion <em>The Vampire&#146;s Assistant </em>elicits is apathy. Until, that is, it reveals itself to be a prologue for an all-out war in future instalments, at which point the mismatching shots and recurring hollow maxims (&#145;It&#146;s not about what you are; it&#146;s about who you are&#146;) inspire bloodlust on the viewer&#146;s part. At the very least, such triteness will dredge up a desire to keep the Weitz family &#150; brother Chris was responsible for the leaden <em>Golden Compass </em>d&#233;b&#226;cle &#150; away from the first chapters of big budget franchises.

				<description><![CDATA[Sam Mendes began shooting <em>Away</em> <em>We Go </em>while the editing suite was still warm from <em>Revolutionary Road</em>. You can imagine why, after that gruelling anatomy of a failed marriage, he was drawn to the story of a happy and well-adjusted, if under-prepared, couple on the threshold of family life. Let&#146;s hope it was more fun to make, anyway, because it&#146;s pretty insufferable to watch.
The script, by husband and wife Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida, follows semi-slacker thirty somethings Burt (Krasinski) and Verona (Rudolph) as they search for the perfect site to raise their unborn child, zipping from Arizona to Wisconsin, Colorado to Carolina. Along the way, they encounter relatives and old friends including Burt&#146;s hippy-dippy parents (Daniels and O&#146;Hara), his neofeminist childhood pal (Gyllenhaal), Verona&#146;s braying former colleague (Janney), and two old buddies (Chris Messina and Melanie Lynskey) and their adopted kids.
Krasinski and Rudolph are amiable company and there&#146;s some nice scenic photography from Ellen Kuras (shot mostly in Connecticut). But the film&#146;s laboured humour and self-satisfaction grate, as does its twee indie-acoustic soundtrack. That every supporting character is depicted as unbearable or pitiable or both would be bad enough; what&#146;s worse is that the couple discover nothing about themselves that wasn&#146;t obvious from the opening, unless you count the banal dictum that there&#146;s no place like home. A screenplay that jokes about the lack of tension between its leads should at least have something to say about their interaction with the rest of the world. This doesn&#146;t.

				<description><![CDATA[We know what you&#146;re thinking: another zombie comedy? Seriously? Didn&#146;t <em>Shaun of the Dead </em>have the last word on zombies? Not at all. Don&#146;t think of this as an American rip-off of a good British idea. Think of it as an American response, with a distinctly American, raucous brand of humour to counter the drollery of <em>Shaun</em>. But <em>Zombieland </em>does have one quality lacking in many American movies: Fleischer and screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick know when to quit. This horror comedy is into the end credits long before you&#146;re tired of it.
Our unlikely hero (Eisenberg), a neurotic loner, has survived the zombie infestation by developing simple rules, which punctuate the movie. #1: do your cardio. Cut to a fat guy being run down by zombies. And so it goes. Eisenberg&#146;s unnamed character (whom we know only as &#145;Columbus&#146; because that&#146;s where he&#146;s originally headed) ends up on the road with &#145;Tallahassee&#146; (Harrelson). Eisenberg and Harrelson have wonderful energy as a comic duo. Harrelson takes his patented crazy Southerner thing into a whole new territory of weird, and Eisenberg fumbles around like the early Woody Allen &#150; if Allen had been armed and ready to kick zombie ass. Eventually, they take up with hottie Stone and her little sister Breslin, a pair of grifters who have survived by their wits. This merry band heads west toward a rumoured zombie-free zone in California.
Along the way, there are zombie attacks, Twinkie jokes (Tallahassee is obsessed with them), a little flirting between Eisenberg and Stone, and a jaw-droppingly funny celebrity cameo. (We daren&#146;t say more). Reese and Wernick&#146;s sense of humour feels random, but this movie is as compact and functional as a Swiss watch. One that runs on brains.

				<description><![CDATA[With no A-list stars and a modest budget, David Twohy&#146;s taut, palmsweating thriller has two things going for it: it keeps you guessing and it doesn&#146;t insult your intelligence. Set on the Hawaiian island of Kaui, where a 14.5km trail winds through the jungle to an idyllic beach, it&#146;s kickstarted by the news that a couple has killed some honeymooners.
We&#146;re then introduced to nerdy, newlywed screenwriter Cliff (Zahn) and his wide-eyed wife Cydney (Jovovich), who upset tattooed hitchhiker Kale (Hemsworth) and his cowed wife Cleo (Shelton) when they refuse them a lift.
Also on the trail are yarnspinning ex-soldier Nick (Olyphant) and his chatty Southern girlfriend Gina (Sanchez), an outdoors gal capable of skinning a hunted goat. But can Cliff and Cydney trust them any more than the aggressive hitchhikers? And will they make it out alive? As suspicion falls on each couple in turn, Twohy <em>(Pitch Black) </em>sustains the tension by constantly undermining our sense of certainty.

				<description><![CDATA[The residual affection for <em>Swingers </em>duo Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau comes perilously close to depletion with this ensemble comedy exposing the foibles of 40-something relationships. They co-write and co-star in this plot-heavy affair which brings four couples to the sun-splashed surroundings of &#145;Eden East&#146;, then puts them through a compulsory programme of marriage-guidance therapy before they can get on the jet-skis.
The pretext is enabling old pal Jason Bateman to procreate with partner Kristen Bell, but circumstances expose the flaws in both Vaughn and Favreau&#146;s own relationships. So, expectations of farce are stymied by long stretches of midlife navel gazing, notwithstanding Favreau&#146;s willingness to humiliate himself as the lecherously frustrated hubby in the party. Meanwhile, the director is unable to impose rhythm or focus on the escalating complications, and allows scene-stealing yoga teacher Carlos Ponce&#146;s amusing shtick to go on far too long. Somehow though, Vaughn&#146;s cheeky appeal remains intact, but he needs better material. They all do.

				<title>Where the Wild Things Are</title>

				<description><![CDATA[If you wondered how Spike Jonze and screenwriter Dave Eggers could expand Maurice Sendak&#146;s nine-sentence children&#146;s book into a feature-length film, you may still be wondering on the way out. This small and underwhelming movie stands to go down as the year&#146;s biggest disappointment, unless that <em>Avatar </em>footage turns out to be representative.
The collected ensemble sets the bar high: as the inventor of <em>Jackass</em>, Jonze clearly remembers what it&#146;s like to see the world through pre-adolescent eyes. When Max (Records) frolics in the snow or peers around the corner at his mother&#146;s new boyfriend (Ruffalo), the film does a remarkable job of showing us only what a child would understand. But once our pyjama&#146;d protagonist ventures where the wild things are, it becomes clear there&#146;s not a lot going on. Max meets a motley crew: the James Gandolfini wild thing, the Forest Whitaker wild thing, the Chris Cooper wild thing, the Lauren Ambrose wild thing. It&#146;s admirable that the movie refuses to cheapen Sendak&#146;s vision by inflating it (aside from adding a ho-hum, anti-lying moral), but given the resources involved, the middle section&#146;s reliance on repetitive, storyless forest antics suggests a failure of creativity.
Before we crush your dreams, it needs to be said that the film looks phenomenal &#150; both in terms of cinematography and special effects. (The wild things hail from Jim Henson&#146;s Creature Shop, although the faces were computer-manipulated.) Watching these furry friends, you realise certain pleasures are being lost with the digital revolution. But the movie too often feels like a soulless technical exercise, which is about as unchildlike a thing as it could be.

				<description><![CDATA[Take a few seconds to think back over Wes Anderson&#146;s films and imagine how a stop-motion animated version of Roald Dahl&#146;s <em>Fantastic Mr Fox </em>might look and sound if directed by this Euro-leaning, Texan caricaturist. Would it, like <em>The Life Aquatic&#133; </em>and <em>Rushmore</em>, offer a hyper-realistic uniform of sets and costumes? Would it, like <em>The Darjeeling Limited </em>and <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em>, explore an eccentric family, with a father figure looming large and relatives at loggerheads? Would the soundtrack include The Rolling Stones? Would there be roles for Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson? Would it be hip? Would the comedy have a gentlemanly sophistication and even be wilfully exclusive? Would it trade in emotions but feel distancing at times?
Of course, as anyone familiar with Anderson&#146;s films will know, the answer to all these questions is, &#145;yes&#146;. So it turns out: this is an animation, but it&#146;s also a Wes Anderson movie. The difference is that it&#146;s light on its feet compared to the heavy machinery of <em>The Life Aquatic&#133; </em>or the ponderous comedy of <em>The Darjeeling Limited</em>. It&#146;s also a kids&#146; film, which allows Anderson and his gang &#150; is there another director so collegiate? &#150; to have fun. Anderson himself voices a fey estate agent, and the film has the pace of a caper.
What remains to be seen is how audiences, especially children, will react to the jolty, bristling look of stopmotion animation in the age of CGI and digital 3D. The loving, handmade, purist look of the film, reminiscent of Michel Gondry&#146;s <em>The Science of Sleep</em>, sees towelling as fields, cellophane as water and cotton wool as smoke, and will probably excite adults more than their kids &#150; who will be more taken by the constant, restless unfolding of the plot. Elements that, in turn, grow a little tedious if you&#146;re a grown-up.
Dahl&#146;s book was a short, sharp affair illustrated in pen and ink by Quentin Blake, whose drawings don&#146;t have much bearing on Anderson&#146;s version; his colour palette takes its cue from the autumnal hues of fox fur. The main characters in Dahl&#146;s book were Mr Fox himself, a dapper chap trying to protect his family from danger, and his foes, three ciderswilling farmers called Boggis, Bunce and Bean. Anderson and co-writer Noah Baumbach (who directed <em>The Squid and the Whale) </em>have fleshed out the story so there are more characters (Dafoe&#146;s jive-talking rat is genius) and the Fox family has more personality.
Mrs Fox (Streep) is the voice of reason to her husband&#146;s impetuousness, while their son Ash (Schwartzman), a needy, moody teen, is pitched against a kungfu- kicking cousin, Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson), who comes to stay. Mr Fox, voiced so appropriately by George Clooney, flits between human behaviour (buying a house, starting a career) and animal instincts (stealing chickens, attacking his food). The push and pull between the tame life and the wild one is the unifying theme. It&#146;s all very transatlantic &#150; the setting and baddies are English; the animals are hip Americans. This is one crafty fox, in every sense.

				<description><![CDATA[Matt Damon gives a movie star&#146;s performance in <em>The Informant! </em>&#150; all moustache, oversize specs and eventual bald pate. His character, Mark Whitacre, is a real-life corporate sad sack, a manic depressive who blew the whistle on a price-fixing conspiracy at the agri-industry conglomerate Archer Daniels Midland. The only problem was that the bipolar Whitacre kept changing his story: as the &#145;truth&#146; became more malleable and labyrinthine, the exec&#146;s own embezzlement sins came to light, and he served eight years in federal prison.
Damon plays the movieland version of the man as a cartoonish collection of tics and digressive internal monologues. It&#146;s an approach that calls to mind Richard Attenborough&#146;s wide-eyed, Elmer Fuddian menace as the serial-killer protagonist of <em>10 Rillington Place</em>. But there&#146;s something crucial missing, a sense of empathy and experience that would make the actor&#146;s surface acrobatics seem less of an awards-baiting stunt.
Director-cinematographer Steven Soderbergh&#146;s indifference to the material is palpable and of a piece with his deathly dull output of late. It hardly matters if the subject is Vegas thieves <em>(Ocean&#146;s Thirteen) </em>or Che Guevara <em>(Che) </em>&#150; Soderbergh just shows up and does some purposelessly sterile image making, as if he were a disembodied tech-head shooting a demo reel on next-day deadline. <em>The Informant! </em>is one of his ugliest works, photographed on the RED digital camera system in such a way that depth of field is flattened into backlit brown mush. Only composer Marvin Hamlisch brings his A-game, contributing a frenzied, perpetually upbeat score that burrows deeper into Whitacre&#146;s psyche than anything else in this black-comic blunder.

				<description><![CDATA[Arriving on a wave of carefully orchestrated viral hype, <em>Paranormal Activity </em>lacks the conceptual elegance of its obvious precursor, <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>. The movie invites us into the home of a couple (Featherston and Sloat) conveniently saddled with the same names as the actors who play them. Katie suspects a haunting, so in what&#146;s now a time-honoured tradition, they&#146;ve grabbed a camcorder and elected to film everything. While superior to inept would-be <em>Blairs </em>like <em>Open Water</em>, Oren Peli&#146;s horror flick often has the feel of a film-school exercise in which the object is to wring maximum suspense from rudimentary tools.
Still, there aren&#146;t many movies that have the power to scare you with the sound of a creaking door, and it&#146;s hard not to admire the way <em>Paranormal Activity </em>makes a virtue of simplicity. The opening scenes, which suggest nothing so much as a mumblecore horror flick, are eye-gougingly boring and slapdash &#150; but that&#146;s the point. In its most effective steal, the film makes brilliant use of a stubbornly fixed camera: as we wait, trapped with the tripod in Micah and Katie&#146;s bedroom, wondering what happened downstairs, it&#146;s easy to forgive the movie&#146;s crudeness.

				<description><![CDATA[A companion piece to Fernando Meirelles&#146; souped-up (and lapped-up) 2002 urban crime drama, <em>City of God</em>, Paulo Morelli&#146;s <em>City of Men </em>replaces that film&#146;s hypnotic sadokineticism with something equally, if more quietly, audacious. By accentuating the humour and humanity of people stuck in desperate circumstances instead of fetishising the violence that surrounds them, <em>City of Men </em>serves as a belated corrective to its predecessor.
The follow-up concerns two young Rio favela dwellers, best friends Ace and Wallace (Silva and Cunha, both non-professional actors who also appeared in Meirelles&#146; film), coping with a drug-gang turf war that forces them to reconcile with the past and accept incipient adulthood. A rift develops between them when Wallace finds his long-absent father and Ace begins taking more comfort in the thug life than with his wife (Monteiro) and son. Meanwhile, the gang leaders (Haagensen and Eduardo &#145;BR&#146; Piranha) pursue what amounts to a deadly, futile game of king of the hill that produces no real victor. This wry reductionism gives <em>City of Men </em>a moral edge over the gunplay-besotted posturing of the previous film, despite the fact that Morelli occasionally succumbs to earnestness and sentimentality, and loses narrative focus in the final act.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Three of Jodi Picoult&#146;s novels have already been adapted for Lifetime TV, a channel known for its mawkish output; Nick Cassavetes is best known for romantic drama <em>The Notebook</em>. So naked bathos-mongering is what people will come to <em>My Sister&#146;s Keeper </em>for, and the film mostly delivers. After Kate (Vassilieva) was diagnosed with leukemia as a child, her parents engineered Anna (Breslin) <em>in vitro </em>to be her perfect genetic match for surplus bone marrow and kidneys. Now the younger kid wants out, and she&#146;s willing to sue for &#145;medical emancipation&#146;. The family rips down the middle, with Anna and Dad (Jason Patric) on one side and the insanely devoted mom, Sara (Diaz), on the other decrying Anna&#146;s &#145;selfishness&#146;.
Picoult&#146;s fashioned herself as a conversation-starter about genetics and medical ethics, but her lurid scenario is basically nonsense. Cassavetes has unexpectedly toned down the over-the-top series of twists from the novel&#146;s last third, though restraint is still a relative concept. The tearjerking is mostly along the sister-sister and mother-daughter axes, aside from a 15-minute romance Kate has with a fellow patient. <em>(Notebook </em>fans should love the immortal line &#145;If I didn&#146;t have cancer, I&#146;d never have met you.&#146;) Diaz is a whiny non-factor, but typically sharp supporting work from Alec Baldwin and Joan Cusack make proceedings tolerable for long-suffering boyfriends.

				<description><![CDATA[Denis Dercourt&#146;s stylish, subtle and highly assured film is a pleasingly suspenseful psychological drama in the style of Hitchcock or early Chabrol. Fran&#231;ois plays M&#233;lanie, the small-town butcher&#146;s daughter whose ambitions as a pianist were dashed during a childhood audition for the Conservatory when one of the jurors, concert pianist Ariane Fouch&#233;court (Frot), distracted her by signing an autograph. A decade after this unwitting but fateful slight, shy, quiet M&#233;lanie happens to find herself working as an intern for the law firm owned by Fouch&#233;court&#146;s husband Jean (Greggory). Her diligence and dependability lead him to hire her as a governess to his son, and soon enough she&#146;s firmly ensconced in their home and helping out as Ariane&#146;s page-turner as the pianist prepares for a big comeback concert. Is M&#233;lanie plotting revenge? Nursing a crush? And if so, on whom? Or is she merely hoping to bask in some reflected glory? (Geoff Andrew)

				<description><![CDATA[Didn&#146;t Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Woody Allen make this movie 20 years ago? The idea of building an omnibus film around a major city is itself flawed; it&#146;s like saying, &#145;Do whatever&#146;. Some of the directorial roster has searched for NYC-specific anecdotes, but the only surprise is that the movie saves its bickering Brighton Beach couple (Wallach and Leachman) for the end. Segments range from beautiful- but-incoherent (Kapur) to funnybut- stupid (Ratner).

				<description><![CDATA[Megan Fox wields her sexuality like a blunt object &#150; a sledgehammer in lipgloss &#150; in the new horror-comedy <em>Jennifer&#146;s Body</em>. It&#146;s the film&#146;s one truly witty joke: that floating down these suburban high-school halls in a pink hoodie could be a smiling demon, a toothy weapon of boy destruction. (You can&#146;t imagine the character working half as well with any of today&#146;s other brittle young actors, and Fox seems to know it.) Jennifer&#146;s unlikely best friend, nicknamed &#150; let&#146;s hope &#150; Needy (Seyfried), remembers their slumber parties and one-on-ones before her buxom confidant was subtly transformed, after a fiery night at a roadhouse, into a bile-spewing monster with a huge appetite.
And still, the guys come running. So there&#146;s jealousy between the two &#150; or, in the language of a script by <em>Juno</em>&#146;s Diablo Cody, &#145;lime-green jello&#146;. Since winning her Oscar, Cody&#146;s been pegged by the backlash as a one-note sarcasm machine, which is way too harsh given her earthy, authentic teenspeak (Jennifer, luring a victim, admits to a &#145;wettie&#146;) and her obvious gift for thematic construction. As with the classic <em>Carrie</em>, these violent rages could be sprung, metaphorically, from the furnace of female puberty, and you wish director Karyn Kusama <em>(Girlfight) </em>had pushed Needy, her awkward blonde heroine, into more of an attitude. (Seyfried&#146;s a dud.)
The movie has a centrefold sheen to it &#150; and some lesbianic soft-core flirtation to match &#150; as its plot dives deeply into <em>Twilight</em>-esque heavy-melo meltdown in the last act. Cody throws one too many losses at Needy; the screenwriter loses her satirical way about halfway through. But for a while, this has real fangs.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Rob Zombie goes out of his way to differentiate the second film in his rebooted <em>Halloween </em>series from the first. This is most noticeable in the grubby, grainy 16mm visuals that act as a squalid conduit to the headspace of Laurie Strode (Taylor-Compton), sister of seemingly indestructible psychopath Michael Myers (Mane). Now living with Sheriff Lee Brackett (Brad Dourif) and his daughter Annie (Danielle Harris), Laurie has no inkling of her lineage outside of the subconscious: she&#146;s tortured primarily in dreams, and Zombie opens with a doozy that pays explicit homage to the original <em>Halloween II </em>while bettering it in just about every respect.
When his heroine wakes up in the real world, however, the writer-director starts losing his footing. Laurie&#146;s story holds interest thanks to Taylor-Compton&#146;s intense dedication to the role, especially when the character&#146;s feral brother comes calling. But a side plot involving Michael&#146;s former psychiatrist Sam Loomis (McDowell), now an egocentric celebrity author, weighs down the proceedings with limp satire of our media-addled age. Zombie remains committed to showing how violence lingers with, and perverts, all who are touched by it, yet his carnivalesque approach often undercuts his very real empathy. He panders to the cheap seats whenever he&#146;s not being scary

				<description><![CDATA[As Ang Lee films go, <em>Taking Woodstock </em>is relatively painless. When he isn&#146;t reaching for lofty, award-baiting heights <em>(Brokeback Mountain) </em>or being deathly, soul-sappingly dull <em>(The Ice Storm)</em>, the infrequent pleasures in the director&#146;s work tend to rise to the surface. This adaptation of a memoir by Elliot Tiber, who was instrumental in organising the 1969 &#145;peace and love&#146; concert, is most rewarding when it abandons narrative altogether. The centrepiece sequence, in which protagonist Elliot Teichberg (Martin) takes an acid trip with two VW-van hippies (Paul Dano and Kelli Garner), is as beautifully constructed as the delirious murder scene in <em>Lust, Caution </em>and the windswept skip through the desert in <em>Hulk</em>. It also resonates with a profound sense of possibility and regret &#150; one of the few times when it doesn&#146;t feel like Lee and his screenwriter, James Schamus, are looking back at these events from a mock-enlightened perspective.
The movie&#146;s worst passages condescendingly play on our modern-day awareness: a peripheral character reveals that people are charging for bottled water; concert organiser Michael Lang (Groff) makes a closingline mention of this awesome Rolling Stones concert that&#146;s in the works. Such willy-nilly referencing negates the film&#146;s effectiveness as a period piece and calls attention to some of the more questionable omissions. Seems it&#146;s okay to have a sassy, gun-toting transsexual (Schreiber) dispense self-actualising <em>bons mots </em>to Elliot while conveniently ignoring the real-world Elliot&#146;s prominent role in the Stonewall Riots. Lee and Schamus make history blandly palatable; in the process, they rob the times and the people they&#146;re portraying of their complexities.
<em>By Keith Uhlich</em>

				<description><![CDATA[Tarr&#146;s most ambitious work is structured in 12 chapters &#150; it&#146;s a black-andwhite adaptation of L&#225;szl&#243; Krasznahorkai&#146;s novel &#150; and the narrative movement follows the titular dance steps, moving back and forth around pivotal scenes, viewed from multiple perspectives. It opens with arguments and planned betrayals over the year&#146;s wages for a failing collective farm &#150; with the tense interaction noted by an alcoholic doctor. It then shifts into a larger frame with the reappearance of a quasi-Messianic leader. Allegorical yet historically precise, it is an anti-authoritarian satire and metaphysical treatise. In addition, it might well be the great film of entropy. A soundscape of weary accordion and resounding bells balances the sacred and profane spheres. Formally in dynamic tension between the claustrophobic intimacy of Tarr&#146;s early influence, Cassavetes, and the rigorously choreographed grace of Tarkovsky and Jancs&#243;, this startling, apocalyptic work is sometimes over-extended, but it builds to a powerful, rhythmic climax of breakdown and withdrawal.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This ghost story from the haunters&#146; perspective was one of the most surprisingly enjoyable films of its time. The drearily happy Maitlands (Baldwin and Davis) drive into the river, come up dead and return to their beloved, quaint house as spooks intent on despatching the hideous New York yuppie family which usurped their property. The humour unfolds as the horrible Deetzes (Jones and O&#146;Hara) fill the house with revolting avant-garde art, bulldozers and camp interior designers spitting venom. Only their mournful teenage daughter (Ryder) seems either aware of or in tune with the ghostly couple, whose failure to shine in the scare stakes finally drags them into the arms of the gunslingerexorcist Betelgeuse (Keaton), a kind of OTT demonic Clint Eastwood of the underworld (who rids houses of unwanted humans). Off-the wall humour and some sensational sight gags make the movie, maddeningly disjointed though it sometimes is, a truly astonishing piece of work.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[In the basement of Mushnik&#146;s Skid Row florist&#146;s, weedy shop-boy Seymour (Moranis) pines for bubbly-blonde shop-girl Audrey (Greene). But the basement is also home to a strange and unusual plant, a growing, bloodthirsty demon determined to devour mankind. It&#146;s hard to pinpoint just what makes this surreal saga such a delight. There&#146;s the music, a wonderful doo-wop score from the off-Broadway hit based on Roger Corman&#146;s 1960 cult classic. There are veteran comedians (Murray, Candy, Belushi). There&#146;s Steve Martin as &#145;The Dentist&#146;, Audrey&#146;s biker boyfriend, a happy-go-lucky sadist who nearly steals the show. And finally there&#146;s the plant, a 50ft jiving, root-stomping vegetable from whose 49ft lips comes the voice of Levi Stubbs of The Four Tops. Though Frank Oz will be damned for changing the play&#146;s original ending &#150; let them eat carrots &#150; this wild and witty musical is great fun.

				<description><![CDATA[It&#146;s fair to say that expectations were low for <em>GI Joe</em>. Inspired by a line of stirringly patriotic &#146;60s action figures, produced by the mastermind behind <em>Transformers </em>and <em>Doom </em>movies and directed by Stephen Sommers (<em>Van Helsing</em>), the film promised to be the runt in 2009&#146;s blockbuster litter. Which only proves that in Hollywood, as in sport and politics, lowered expectations can often be a blessing in disguise. If <em>GI Joe </em>had hit our screens last year, alongside <em>The Dark Knight</em> and <em>Iron Man</em>, it might have struggled to make an impact. But coming on the heels of <em>Wolverine </em>and <em>Terminator: Salvation</em>, it feels like a welcome blast of fresh air.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[You get the feeling with <em>Inglourious Basterds </em>that Quentin Tarantino desperately wants to put away childish things. Nor is he hiding the fact. Not only is Brad Pitt&#146;s closing line of the movie &#145;This may well be my masterpiece,&#146; but <em>Inglourious Basterds </em>is, a lot of the time, a little more restrained, a little quieter than we&#146;ve come to expect from films like <em>Death Proof </em>and the <em>Kill Bill </em>double header. We say &#145;a little&#146; because much of it is not quiet at all: when the music comes, albeit less frequently than usual, it&#146;s loud; when the deaths occur, they&#146;re gruesome, even sadistic; when the plot kicks in, it&#146;s pure fantasy. That&#146;s all fine, and Tarantino is mostly smart enough to let his usual, entertaining extravagances serve the story rather than the other way around.
The film, which flits freely between French, German and English, takes us through five chapters. First, in 1941, we see Nazi Colonel and &#145;Jew Hunter&#146; Hans Landa (played by Austrian actor Waltz) discover and kill a Jewish family in France; only the youngest daughter gets away. Then we&#146;re introduced to the &#145;basterds&#146;, a notorious gang of eight Jewish-American soldiers who, while deep under cover, roam Nazi-occupied France, murdering German soldiers and collecting scalps as they go.
They&#146;re led by a Tennessee goodtime boy, played by Pitt, yet despite a lot of pre-publicity concerning his role and that of his &#145;basterds&#146;, they&#146;re not on screen a great deal. Pitt&#146;s performance is lively, but he&#146;s upstaged time and again by Waltz, whose performance lends sly comedy, cruel charm and tension to some of the film&#146;s best scenes. For the final chapters we leap to Paris in 1944, where the disparate storylines collide. Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent), who fled the Nazis, is now running a cinema that screens films by Riefenstahl and Pabst (although she also manages to slip Clouzot&#146;s <em>Le Corbeau </em>into the programme). Young Nazi private Frederick (Br&#252;hl), whose gun-toting heroics are being immortalised in a new film produced by Goebbels, takes a shine to Shosanna and the German command decides her cinema would be a great place for the premiere.
Both Shosanna, fuelled by revenge for the death of her family, and the &#145;basterds&#146;, presumably fired by their Jewish ancestry but avowedly only by bloodlust, decide that the premiere is their opportunity to strike. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Tarantino takes the history of cinema more seriously than he takes the history of Europe. References to movies are everywhere: Michael Fassbender&#146;s British spy (who has an amusing, <em>Drive Strangelove</em>-like scene with a superior, played by Mike Myers) used to be a critic for a magazine called <em>Films and Filmmakers</em>; Shosanna&#146;s cinema allows for references to, and discussions of, various directors; and Frederick wonders aloud whether he prefers Chaplin or French silent actor Max Linder.
But then, as ever with the director of <em>Reservoir Dogs </em>and <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, you could say that his films are more about the movies than anything else; not least because Tarantino obviously relishes the chance to take one of the most well-documented periods in history and make it his own.
To some extent, he does that very well. We recognise his style so clearly now &#150; the extended, know-it-all dialogue, the tricky gunplay, the pop-cultural nods &#150; and manages the period adaptation well. There&#146;s even a Mexican stand-off &#224; la <em>Reservoir Dogs </em>and a character who says the word &#145;nigger&#146; &#150; a staple of Tarantino&#146;s films. Even if he says it in French.&#160;]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[We know that Duncan Jones is David Bowie&#146;s son. But more importantly, is his feature debut any good? The answer is a resounding yes, judging by this 1970s-sci-fithrowback, which, for a space movie about the knock-on effects of future technology, is unusually thoughtful, good-looking and well acted. Sam Rockwell is Sam Bell, a nervous lone astronaut on the moon where, at some point in the near future, a corporation is mining Helium-3, now the source of most global energy. It&#146;s Bell&#146;s job to manage this operation in the company of a sympathetic robot called Gerty (one of several nods to Stanley Kubrick&#146;s benchmark <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>).
When we first meet him, Bell&#146;s three-year stint is almost complete, but he&#146;s tired and unhinged &#150; symptoms, no doubt, of solitude and having to communicate with his wife and young child by taped messages as the satellite is broken&#133; If that last fact sounds a bit too convenient, that&#146;s the point: all is not what it seems. Jones has created a credible theatre in which to stage a meditative play on isolation and identity within the bounds of wild fiction, the edges of which are curiously blurred.
Less is more in Jones&#146; eye: he knows that big ideas can be lost amid noisy gestures, so keeps his drama within the confines of a few rooms, with only the odd, more poetic moment unfolding outside on the moon&#146;s surface. As the film goes on, early ideas about loneliness segue into a more troubling study of corporate exploitation and even &#150; here&#146;s a biggie &#150; what it means to be human, when a second Sam Bell (a clone also played by Rockwell) appears and shakes up all perceptions of what&#146;s going on.
The film is not entirely logical &#150; as Jones&#146; famous father would no doubt say, it&#146;s a space oddity &#150; but it raises pleasing questions and looks beautiful.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Tirard&#146;s sprightly, fun and clever film plays like a Gallic Shakespeare in Love, though it portrays the playwright, whose real name was Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (Duris), as more of a victim &#150; albeit a game and resourceful one. Set in 1658, Poquelin looks back on his days as a debtridden actor, manager and provincial comedian. The theatrical games that Tirard and co-writer Gr&#233;goire Vigneron play offer a light, witty and populist satire on period manners, courtly flummery, romantic entanglement, mimicry, identity and selfdelusion (Wally Hammond).

				<description><![CDATA[In Sacha Baron Cohen&#146;s latest parade of in-your-face shamelessness, you can make jokes about Hitler. You can strut around Jerusalem in hot pants and fake Hassidic curls. You can make a pitch for an American TV show with a slot called &#145;Keep It&#133;Or Abort It!&#146;. But, whatever you do, don&#146;t you dare make a gag about Michael Jackson.
The removal of a scene in which Br&#252;no, a disgraced Austrian fashion reporter in Hollywood, stitches up La Toya Jackson and tries to extract her brother&#146;s number from her mobile suggests that Baron Cohen&#146;s comedy isn&#146;t entirely tasteless or free of boundaries.
Which isn&#146;t something you&#146;d believe while watching a talking penis swinging around the screen or while experiencing the succession of filthy and provocative slapstick, stunts, sketches and stitchups that Baron Cohen has jumbled together here into the loosest of loose stories.
The plot is similar to <em>Borat</em>: an eccentric foreigner comes to America, does outrageous things, makes people (some famous) look dumb. Br&#252;no is the third clown in Baron Cohen&#146;s repertoire after Ali G and Borat, and once again he masks an acid tongue and sharp mind with a distracting voice and a never-ending catwalk of ridiculous outfits. But this feels a bit more desperate in the execution, as if Baron Cohen and director Larry Charles are victims of their own success and have had to try much harder to give their film a documentary sheen. There are certainly more question marks hanging over the &#145;real&#146; episodes than there were in <em>Borat </em>&#150; and fewer of those episodes too &#150; and you doubt Baron Cohen could ever stretch to making another film along similar lines.
But what&#146;s lacking in the presentation, Baron Cohen makes up for with sheer ballsy, outrageous bravado. He bulldozes you with shock tactics. Br&#252;no is a mesmerising invention, by turns repulsive and compelling. His exploits, from becoming an extra on US TV show <em>Medium </em>to taking a bunch of rednecks hunting, zero in on fair-if-easy targets, whether that&#146;s homophobic hetero America or the celebrity world, for which Br&#252;no is a global ambassador. (At one point, he visits a Hollywood PR to find a charity to support. &#145;We&#146;ve had Darfur,&#146; he says, &#145;so what&#146;s Dar-five?&#146;)
The humour veers wildly between the childish (mistaking Hamas for &#145;hummus&#146;) and the savage (an encounter with a &#145;healer&#146; of gays) and isn&#146;t always focused enough &#150; what&#146;s the point, in this context, of ribbing representatives of the Palestinian and Israeli causes? And although there&#146;s little for the openminded to find troubling, some might bristle at bitchy Br&#252;no as a stereotype of a gay man obsessed with sex, clothes and fame. But most viewers won&#146;t have the time or energy to dwell on such worries: they&#146;ll be watching with one eye closed from embarrassment and the other welling up with tears of laughter.

				<description><![CDATA[There are four important lessons you&#146;ll learn from this Fatal Attraction-esque domestic thriller. If you&#146;re a corporate bigwig (Elba) and some leggy blonde temp (Larter) starts talking to you, run away; she&#146;s probably a &#145;crazy b*tch&#146; who will stalk you. If your receptionist is a borderline-offensive gay stereotype, he will gab away important expositional information. Unless you are impervious to falling chandeliers, don&#146;t piss off Beyonc&#233; Knowles &#150; ever. Finally, don&#146;t think that exploiting female paranoia and the promise of Knowles throwing punches are enough to make up for your unabashed B-movie hitting the skids at the halfway point (David Fear).]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The scramble to keep kids entertained over the summer months continues with this underwhelming spin on <em>E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial </em>and <em>Gremlins</em>.
Dragged off to a remote mansion for the summer months, precocious teen Tom (Jenkins) and his self-obsessed sister Ashley (Pearson) uncover a devious alien plot to launch a worldwide mind-control invasion from their loft.
There&#146;s not a great deal to recommend, aside from a few decent one-liners, some inventive anti-gravity slapstick and a brief, but enjoyably bonkers, remote-controlled kung-fu battle between one of the kids and Tom&#146;s brain-zapped granny. But such fleeting charms are largely outweighed by an unexceptional script, a brace of shabby performances (from both kids and adults) and some dismal CG effects: the aliens appear almost transparent, like animated transfers barely clinging to the screen.
<em>Aliens in the Attic </em>will probably prove an effective distraction for undemanding pre-teens; their parents might find it more of a chore.]]></description>

&#160;
When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, you&#146;ll be ready for a whole new batch of intriguing celluloid from the country that gave us La Dolce Vita, Il Postino and The Bicycle Thieves. Back for its second year at The Cathay, the festival opens with a murder in a small town in The Girl by the Lake (La Ragazza del Lago), and closes with a comedy about cut-throat sales techniques and American-style motivational exercises in A Whole Life Ahead (Tutta la Vita Davanti). In between the cold-blooded killing and comic capers, there&#146;s Skylark Farm &#150; a film based on a novel by Antonia Arslan that recounts the plight of the Armenian people during the Young Turk movement in Turkey circa 1915.

				<description><![CDATA[The Altamont movie, and unless you get off on violence accompanied by music played loud and raw, something of a bummer. If you love the Stones, you&#146;re likely to be irritated by the fact that the camera stays on Mick Jagger for virtually every frame; if you&#146;re keen to understand why the notorious murder took place and what responsibility the musicians should admit to, you&#146;re left with a vacuous look of shock and confusion on the singer&#146;s face. Still, it is a reminder that the &#146;60s were not entirely about love, peace and limp liberalism.

&#160;
A distillation of the 1967 International Pop Festival in California, this is quite simply one of the best rock concert films ever, thanks not only to great performances &#150; towards the end things really start cooking, with Janis Joplin, Otis Redding and Jimi Hendrix &#150; but also to the way it sums up the spirit of the Summer of Love while never appearing sentimental. Hang on to the end, however, when a small Indian man appears nursing a sitar: Ravi Shankar&#146;s exhilarating 25-minute finale is the best thing in the entire movie

				<description><![CDATA[At first glance, dolphins and whales seem like an unlikely choice for the 3D treatment, since the ocean doesn&#146;t offer a lot of the necessary depth cues &#150; you&#146;ve got the swimmers against a characterless background of water. But the first time a camera cruises down the side of a whale, that objection falls away. The narration (read by Daryl Hannah, sounding oddly like Laurie Anderson sans irony) falls into a repetitive structure for each species (they&#146;re beautiful, they&#146;re endangered, repeat), but as educational conservation films go, it&#146;s pretty effective

Cotillard&#146;s throaty, Oscar-baiting imitation of Piaf is the film&#146;s chief virtue, allowing the actress to alternate between two modes &#150; impetuous gamine and frazzled junkie. But after dispensing with Piaf&#146;s early years (singing lessons in a brothel, battle with blindness, teenage circus job), the movie falls into an interminable cycle of public performances and backstage crankiness, punctuated by three or four accidental deaths

				<description><![CDATA[Not a remake of the sturdy Ray Milland chiller from 1944 but a surprisingly restrained version of the stylish K-horror smash A Tale of Two Sisters (2003), The Uninvited may strike even viewers who don&#146;t know the original as disarmingly familiar. A thriller in which Dad&#146;s new girlfriend probably killed Mom and will stop at nothing to prevent that discovery? It&#146;s almost charming to see directors make one of those. Almost. The movie hardly plays fair, and Elizabeth Banks is an unconvincing gorgon, but Emily Browning is as adorable as the concept itself (Ben Kenigsberg).]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Money men are the new villains in this timely thriller, which sets the rumpled integrity of Interpol agent Clive Owen and the pinched determination of US investigator Naomi Watts on the trail of skullduggery when the IBBC hires a 'consultant' (read: hitman) to cover its tracks. The quest for truth and justice involves a familiar parade of shady meetings, car chases, punch-ups and a truly spectacular shoot-out inside New York&#146;s Guggenheim, though the increasingly scrambled plotting doesn&#146;t quite measure up to director Tom Tykwer&#146;s slinky, elegant handling of it.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This Swedish movie lacks the romanticism of Bram Stoker&#146;s <em>Dracula</em>, the teenybopper appeal of <em>Twilight </em>and the action-packed sequences of <em>Underworld</em>. But this is a good thing; the film&#146;s barren landscapes and lingering shots are all it needs to haunt audiences. And we praise director Tomas Alfredson for having crafted one of the most memorable films about a vampire in love.
&#160;
Eli (Leandersson) is a 12-year-old vampire who moves into a new flat in a Stockholm suburb with her caretaker. When she meets Oskar (Hedebrant), a pale blond boy at the mercy of a group of bullies, Eli falls in love. The two exchange tender moments together; when apart, the young girl stalks the streets and feeds on unsuspecting townsfolk. From the sound effects (the actual heartbeats of the child actors) to the locations, the Swedish director keeps it organic and minimal; the few locations used in this film include a desolate snow-covered playground and Eli&#146;s one-bedroom apartment, with its peeling wallpaper and treasures collected over 200 years.
&#160;
In the film&#146;s most grotesque scenes of dismemberment, Alfredson combines the tenderness of Martin Weisz&#146;s psychological horror film <em>Grimm Love </em>(2006) and the vulnerability of Guillermo del Toro&#146;s dark child fantasy <em>Pan&#146;s Labyrinth</em> (2006). Our personal favourite? The swimming pool scene at the end of the film. If you think you&#146;ve seen one too many coming-of-age films or emo vampire romances, allow Alfredson and co to take you to a new terrain of supernatural love.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[<em>Hotel for Dogs</em> is the story of a couple of orphaned kids who take in stray pups and make a home for them in an abandoned New York hotel. You see, the kids feel a kinship with these castoff mutts because they, too, have no one to look after them. Big-hearted social worker Bernie (Cheadle) is doing his best to find Andi (Roberts) and the precocious Bruce (Austin) a good family, but he really screws the pooch when he lands the siblings with foster parents Lois and Carl Scudder (Lisa Kudrow and Kevin Dillon), a dim-witted couple who intend to form a band and drop their &#145;rock manifesto&#146; on an unsuspecting world (Drew Toal).]]></description>

With the clock counting down, a sinister force systematically kills the jaded superheroes as their world watches and does nothing. So when a nuclear war threatens the lives of the common man, these costumed vigilantes have to ask themselves whether they care enough to give a sh*t.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Chris Evans is pleasant enough to look at, in a fratboy way, but he&#146;s not someone you&#146;d pick to develop an intricate plan to outsmart his opponents. So it&#146;s pretty amusing when, in the middle of this rebel-kids-withpsychic- powers-versus-evil-governmentagency mess, telekinetic slacker Evans suddenly demonstrates the strategic gifts of Carl von Clausewitz. But you shouldn&#146;t be looking for plausibility in a movie that features psychics getting info by sniffing toothbrushes; you want kick-ass fights and chases. Alas, McGuigan&#146;s jittery editing and shaky cameras make the action confusing rather than thrilling, and nothing can save this movie from the screenplay&#146;s nearly incomprehensible twists and turns (Hank Sartin). ]]></description>

Stevenson plays Marvel Comics&#146; mature-themed antihero, a homicidal vigilante whose skull-chest iconography, combat expertise and vast arsenal make him the bane of the criminal underworld. The violence is hysterically relentless: Craniums are cracked, exploded, caved in and pulverised. Punishing, yes, for all involved (Stephen Garrett).]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Vintage satanic-conspiracy clich&#233;s abound in this tame thriller packed with TV actors. Molly (Bennett) and her father want a fresh start after her crazy mother tries to kill her. They move to a new town, but Molly packs plenty of baggage: nightmares, nosebleeds, aural hallucinations etc. She compounds her problems by befriending the class outcast (Collins) and crossing the alpha mean girl (McCord) by flirting with her dreamboat boyfriend (Crawford). If you know your devil-cult movies, you won&#146;t be surprised how this one turns out (Maitland McDonagh).]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The ailing James Bond series was well and truly rebooted with 2006&#146;s hard-as-nails <em>Casino Royale</em>, and <em>Quantum of Solace</em> &#150; the latest addition to that failsafe franchise &#150; sets to carry on in that general direction. Daniel Craig slinks into the role of the suave secret agent with aplomb, but instils the unflappable ladies&#146; man with much-needed angst and moral apprehension. Brit lass Gemma Arterton, who&#146;s had recent starring roles in <em>St Trinian&#146;s</em> and <em>Three and Out</em>, crops up as the Bond girl; the plot reportedly follows Bond&#146;s clashes with an environmentalist who aims to steal a country&#146;s entire water supply.

				<description><![CDATA[Far from the uplifting sports pictures churned out by Disney, <em>White Palms</em> wallows instead in humiliation rituals and too much time-shifting. Writer-director Szabolcs Hajdu cast his brother Zolt&#225;n as the washed-up gymnast haunted by his days training as a tyke in&#146;80s Budapest, now coaching a recalcitrant teen in Calgary. But how&#146;s this for humiliating: those who can&#146;t dismount perfectly end up in rehearsals for Cirque du Soleil. (Melissa Anderson) ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Comic writer-director Dany Boon&#146;s non-PC, supposedly heartwarming farce trades on French regional prejudices that may bemuse audiences here. Proven&#231;al postmaster Philippe (the discombobulated but bonhomous Merad) is posted north after impersonating the disabled in order to procure a sought-after C&#244;te d&#146;Azur transfer. He finds himself sentenced to two years among the burghers of Bergues, south of Dunkirk. Initially expecting a cold reception &#150; as his well-travelled uncle has told him it&#146;s a community of retarded coal miners existing in -50C temperatures &#150; Philippe warms to the dietary and dialectically challenged locals (notably Boon&#146;s ing&#233;nue, Antoine). But will Philippe&#146;s sun-worshipping son and spouse respond as positively to the land of frost, friendship and fricadelle-et-frites? (Wally Hammond)

				<description><![CDATA[You last saw this pair in <em>Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby</em>, and now they&#146;re back to encourage senseless, uninhibited laughter. Ferrell and Reilly play 39-year-olds who still live with their single parents. When their respective folks decide to get married, the man-boys are forced to live together. What ensues is an unhinged repertoire between both comic actors as they fart, burp, laugh and cry their way into your hearts.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[From the same director who brought you <em>The Full Monty</em> comes this comedic satire about an ageing drummer who is asked to leave his &#146;80s throwback band Vesuvius. Passionate and dedicated to living the rock-star life, he joins his nephew&#146;s high-school band A.D.D., much to their initial disapproval. But they soon realise this relic is too cool for school, and the boys get a hint of sex, and not so much drugs, but definitely a lot of rock &#146;n&#146; roll.]]></description>

In <em>Babylon A.D</em>., there&#146;s a hot babe (Thierry) carrying an organism inside her that has the potential to bring about the second coming of Christ. Set in a post-apocalyptic era, Diesel plays Toorop, a mercenary-turned-reluctant hero who has to decide whether he gives enough of a damn to make a difference.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[It&#146;s the brotherhood from another planet in <em>Meet Dave</em>, a silly family comedy in which the intrepid Captain (Murphy) leads a pint-size team from the planet Nill in a quest to steal salt from Earth&#146;s oceans. Their intergalactic spaceship takes the form of a humanoid craft called Dave. Attempting a more succinct explanation of the harebrained, dime-store sci-fi plot is futile &#150; at no point does the story make any sense. Watching Murphy robotically walk around the city does stir nostalgia for the brilliant <em>Saturday Night Live</em> skit in which he masqueraded as an uptight white guy, but that formidable comic actor is long gone. <br />

				<description><![CDATA[Statham (<em>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</em>) stars in the remake of Roger Corman&#146;s cult classic <em>Death Race 2000</em>. The original starred Sylvester Stallone and David Carradine. The rules were simple back then: the more fellow drivers or innocent bystanders you run down, the more points you get &#150; tongue-in-cheek and violent. Anderson (<em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Alien vs Predator</em>) might not have the same sense of humour, but he does have a knack for hardcore action. Strap on&#133;]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The frontal assault on your tear ducts begins immediately: a mother (del Castillo) breaks down as she pledges her love to her young son Carlitos (Alonso) over the phone. She&#146;s in Los Angeles, an illegal immigrant trying to make a living; he&#146;s still in Mexico, taking care of his infirm grandmother. This weekly call ends with a spectacular display of waterworks, and Patricia Riggen&#146;s moppet melodrama only gets more shameless from there. Carlitos sneaks across the border with a Chicana (<em>Ugly Betty</em>&#146;s America Ferrera), vowing to find her mother. The road is paved with perils &#150; meth-tweakers, chicken-hawk pimps, the multi-tentacled beast known as &#145;La Migra&#146; &#150; but with the help of a patron-saint drifter (Derbez), the boy heads west to reach his goal. <br />

				<description><![CDATA[A truly mind-bending film, Help Me Eros follows a young man who drifts in and out of reality. Scenes like a fish gulping for air while being prepared on a plate for consumption and acrobatic sex right out of the Kama Sutra are the kind of thing that make cinema so great. <br />

Guillermo del Toro (<em>Pan's Labyrinth</em>) reclaims his <em>Hellboy</em> series with more finesse and eye-popping (yes there it is again) visual effects. 'Red' as his affectionately known by his gang of demigods battle evil minions&#160; and the Golden Army after a wicked prince awakens to claim what is rightfully his - our world. <br />

				<description><![CDATA[Gotham City burns again in this sequel to the hugely popular <em>Batman Begins</em>, featuring Heath Ledger in his final role as the unhinged, psychotic Joker, locked in a battle of wits and wills with Christian Bale&#146;s brooding Batman. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman all return, as does visionary British director Christopher Nolan. New to the mix this time are Aaron Eckhart as District Attorney Harvey Dent, aka Two-Face, and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Bruce Wayne&#146;s new love interest, Rachel Dawes. Shadowy and disturbing, <em>The Dark Knight </em>is an action adventure for the 21st century.

What are we leaping to? Flesh-eating, sentient, murderous&#133;vines. Yup: evil plants.

				<description><![CDATA[The eternal battle between the hot-but-arrogant blonde and the hot-and-likeable brunette continues on new turf in the almost gleefully bad <em>Never Back Down</em>. This time, the contenders are shirtless guys and the field of play is mixed martial arts. When Jake (Faris, looking eerily like the young Tom Cruise), a teen with rage issues, moves from the Corn Belt to an Orlando high school where the cool kids are into underground fighting, he&#146;s like fresh meat in a sun-drenched prison. He&#146;s immediately scoped out by rich-kid a**hole Ryan (Gigandet, distilled essence of handsome pr**k), who wants to beat Jake to a pulp. <br />

				<description><![CDATA[Deemed too clever by moviegoers in 2003, Ang Lee&#146;s amiable, intellectual reading of Marvel Comics&#146; angry, green action hero, <em>The Incredible Hulk </em>didn&#146;t really muscle in on the box-office paydirt that is generally expected of gaudy comic-book adaptations. How to remedy that? Make another film on exactly the same subject with a different director and leading man. Ed Norton stars as the anger-prone scientist Bruce Banner and it&#146;s directed by Louis Leterrier, the man who gave us the action-packed <em>Transporter </em>films.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[If anybody was born to play Oscar Wilde, it must have been Stephen Fry: not only does he look like the playwright, but he himself is often portrayed as being too clever and too complex for his own good. Gilbert&#146;s film, with an intelligent screenplay by Julian Mitchell based on Richard Ellmann&#146;s biography, looks curiously old-fashioned. More lavish than Merchant Ivory, it&#146;s a &#146;60sstyle Technicolor affair with a grown-up &#146;90s feel. Unlike its predecessors, it&#146;s able to be frank about the sexual encounters: with devoted friend Robbie Ross; with rent boys to whom Wilde was indulgently generous; and, fatefully, with the love of his life, the beautiful, wilful, spoilt brat Lord Alfred (&#145;Bosie&#146;) Douglas, who didn&#146;t fancy Wilde, but saw him as the alternative to his brutal, bullying father, the Marquess of Queensberry. As Wilde, descending from would-be-doting husband and father to follower of his own &#145;nature&#146;, and finally ruined and disgraced martyr on the tree of English hypocrisy, Fry is utterly convincing.]]></description>

When Jack is presumed lost at sea while collecting specimens, Rover overcomes her debilitating fears and sets off for the island to find the little girl.

				<description><![CDATA[Neil Marshall&#146;s mash note to &#146;80s post-apocalyptic action adventure re-creates the era&#146;s trashy pleasures with such scrupulous fidelity &#150; and distinct lack of irony &#150; that you&#146;d swear the movie was unearthed from the ruins of a Times Square grindhouse. Despite the &#145;Snake&#146; Plissken-esque heroine (Mitra), the vibe is more Corman than Carpenter, with Marshall treating the New World Pictures aesthetic &#150; topless henchwomen! gonzo explosions! gore in excelsis! &#150; as gospel. It&#146;s a blatant slab of Britsploitation aimed at lad-mag subscribers; that a specific generation of American genre addicts will be giddy over this is undeniable <em>(David Fear).</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Since <em>American Pie</em>, Jason Biggs has been the star of choice for many a casting agent in search of a hapless hero for a US teen comedy. While aimed at a slightly older audience, Wedding Daze sees him playing to type, opening with a scene in which his character Anderson literally kills his girlfriend through the shock of a marriage proposal. Fast-forward a year, and Anderson&#146;s friend dares him to start dating again &#150; so he proposes to waitress Katie (Fisher). For various reasons, she says yes. It&#146;s the first in a series of unlikely events that hold no particular interest in themselves, but do give rise to some amusing scenes, mostly riffing on the <em>Meet the Parents</em> genre; while Anderson&#146;s parents are suburban swingers on the quiet, Katie&#146;s stepfather makes Jewish educational toys while her neurotic mother secretly pines for her imprisoned father (Pantoliano). Only about half of the jokes work &#150; those that don&#146;t often prove painful &#150; but the good ones are sharp, dark and sudden enough to draw out laughs of pleasant surprise. A fitfully enjoyable mess. <em>(Anna Smith)</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Leave it to the Koreans to turn a chiselled superhero like Superman into a boy who claims he&#146;s unable to tap into his supernatural powers because the bad guys have placed kryptonite inside his head. Despite this, he is intent on helping others, from preventing global warming to rescuing a lost puppy. Soo-jung (Ji-hyun), a producer, is saved by &#145;Superman&#146; (Jung-min) during an attempted armed robbery. She decides to make a documentary about him and calls it &#145;Superman Saves the World&#146;. It&#146;s a hit &#150; however, the real story is that Superman has a bullet lodged in his brain. This realisation makes an ambitious Soo-jung realise what&#146;s truly important in life&#133; Erm.&#160;<br />

				<description><![CDATA[<em>The Spiderwick Chronicles</em> fails to capture the sense of pixie-dusted wonderment that makes Black and DiTerlizzi&#146;s tomes such page-turners. Other than Highmore&#146;s impressive doubleduty act, most viewers will find the film indistinguishable from every other kids-inpointy- hats adaptation of the past few years. The voice of the novels is lost in translation; what&#146;s left is something that&#146;s merely by the book.&#160;<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Not as whimsical as Love Me If You Dare (2003) or as intelligent as <em>Before Sunset</em> (2004), <em>Leap Years</em> tells the tale of Li-Ann (Chen), a dreamer and a strong believer in the soulmate theory. That&#146;s until she meets Jeremy, and it&#146;s love at first sight. The couple spend their &#145;honeymoon&#146; period touring Chinatown on 29 February 1980. And as all fantasies play out, Li-Ann gets her heart broken when Jeremy confesses that he&#146;s married. He decides to make it up to her by meeting her at the same time, same place, every leap year. This affair spans a period of 20 years until they realise that in order to fulfil one another&#146;s desires, they have to take a leap of faith.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Fans of Japan&#146;s long-running anime franchise <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> will rejoice at this reworking of that TV classic. All that remains of Japan is Tokyo-3, a city tyrannised by giant creatures that seek to eradicate mankind. Hope comes in the tiny form of a boy named Shinji Ikari, who receives a phone call instructing him to go to the NERV Headquarters &#150; an organisation that deals with the destruction of the giants using mechs called Evas. Shinji heads Eva Unit 01 together with Eva Unit 00 pilot, Ayanami Rei.

				<description><![CDATA[What the hell happened to Woody Allen? In the last decade or so, almost every discussion we&#146;ve had regarding Allen has involved locating the precise moment we stopped caring about his annual films. <em>Cassandra&#146;s Dream</em> is a symptom of the problems that have plagued Allen&#146;s career for the last 20 years. Like <em>Match Point</em> (2005) and <em>Scoop</em> (2006), <em>Cassandra&#146;s Dream</em> is set in England, where Allen has tried to revive his career by escaping the label of &#145;New York filmmaker.&#146; While <em>Match Point</em> and <em>Scoop</em> examined the world of the rich and powerful, Dream lets Allen do a little slumming among the proletariat.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Director Sarah Gavron is thoroughly polite in her adaptation of British writer Monica Ali&#146;s much-loved novel. So polite that this graceful tale of lives lived day-by-day, millimetre-bymillimetre, comes off as oddly flat-footed and modest in its lack of drama. Opening in Bangladesh in the &#146;80s, Nazneen (Chatterjee) is a thoughtful teenager dispatched to an east London estate to marry a frog-faced man twice her age. Skip to 2001, and Nazneen is a mother of two whose narrow world expands a little when she takes a job stitching up clothes for the rag trade. Soon, she&#146;s having an affair with a younger man, Karim (Simpson).]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[So, according to recent research, a youthful spot of ill-fated love helped mould Jane Austen into a great writer, and on the back of that comes this capable biographical drama. Perhaps unexpectedly, Hathaway projects the insightfulness of the future author with no little charm, and McAvoy&#146;s charismatic enough to convince as the slightly cocky object of her ardour (if less persuasive in bare-torsoed boxing scenes). Overall, the approach is less fluffily contrived than you&#146;d expect, and though the alignment of circumstance and social status thwarting innocent passions is hardly fresh, it&#146;s handled with thoughtful decorum.<em> (Trevor Johnston)<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Communism&#146;s collapse has been attributed to many factors. Apparently, the real straw that broke the commissars&#146; backs can be traced to a Las Vegas hot-tub party. That&#146;s where Texas congressman Charlie Wilson (Hanks), surrounded by busty strippers doing blow, happened to catch Dan Rather interviewing Afghan mujahideen on TV and decided that, dammit, these anti- Soviet freedom fighters need a-fundin&#146;! So, along with a sassy society matron (Roberts) and a smarmy CIA covert-ops expert (Hoffman), the hedonistic Dixiecrat managed to slip (on the sly) millions of tax dollars and a slew of rocket launchers to the country&#146;s guerrillas. The rest is history.<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Dewey Cox (Reilly) goes through the stations of the pop-music-biopic cross: the judgemental parent, the song inspired by a casual remark, the slide into substance abuse, the creative impasse and the late-career moment of affirmation. Screenwriters Judd Apatow and Kasdan send up every clich&#233; of the genre. Of course, they also include a machete accident played for laughs, a bit of gratuitous full-frontal male nudity &#150; and a monkey. The result is an amusing but uneven mesh of clever material (the songs are deadon parodies) and <em>Scary Movie</em>-style joke-throwing.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This animated feature is a conflation of Iranian writer Satrapi&#146;s four graphic novels that detail with wry humour her childhood in late 1970s and &#146;80s Tehran, her schooldays in Vienna, her return to Iran, her university and a failed marriage and, finally, her decision in her mid-twenties to leave home and move to Paris. The film retains the monochrome of the comics, mixing a stark black-and-white style with softer, round edges and a playful approach to character and movement. Satrapi&#146;s analysis of her journeys between Middle East and West is mostly funny and fascinating, not least when she describes how she left behind the solemnity of the Iran-Iraq war to face the comfortable nonchalance of Austria&#146;s middle-class teenagers. Later, the film struggles to maintain its early humour and rushes to cover too much ground, but most endearing is the relationship between Satrapi (Mastroianni) and her grandmother (Darrieux).<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Much was made of the gay subtext in last year&#146;s 300. Honestly, though, what was the big deal? Actual Spartan warriors reportedly engaged in tons of sweaty man-love in between bouts of brutal killing &#150; it was the Spartan way. The gay jokes are as numerous as the sun-blotting Persian arrows in this harebrained spoof that features dance-offs, hot-in-the-&#146;90s Carmen Electra, lots of bad topical jokes and an awesome former C-list television star: Kevin Sorbo. The film&#146;s finest moment occurs when Captain (Sorbo) exclaims, &#145;I&#146;m gonna go Hercules on his ass.&#146; Ugh.<em> (Drew Toal)</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[If you caught the trailer, you&#146;d be able to guess that Chow and his antics are back after the brilliant <em>Kung Fu Hustle</em>. Here Chow gives the science-fiction genre a strange and hilarious twist (then again, when has he ever played it straight?). The actor-director stars as a man who lives in a decrepit house and takes in a homeless boy. When he finds a toy in a heap of garbage, he brings it back to his &#145;son&#146;, unaware that the toy is actually an alien.

				<description><![CDATA[Possibly bloody itself from an editing-room showdown, this long-gestating adaptation of Ron Hansen&#146;s novel reportedly prompted a conflict of visions: Precocious second-time director Dominik (<em>Chopper</em>) wanted to make a Terrence Malick movie, while studio bigwigs crossed their fingers and prayed for the second coming of <em>Unforgiven</em>. The finished film feels like a tradeoff between the two. <em>Assassination</em> meanders through an hour of awkward lyricism before getting to the real meat: the titular mano a mano between ageing outlaw Jesse James (Pitt) and would-be sidekick Bob Ford (Affleck), who eventually took out his hero &#150; albeit in an act of self-preservation &#150; while James straightened a picture.

				<description><![CDATA[On the hottest day of the summer of 1935, 13-year-old Briony Tallis (Ronan) sees her older sister Cecilia (Knightley) strip off and plunge into the fountain in the garden of their country house. Watching Cecilia is their housekeeper&#146;s son Robbie Turner (McAvoy), a childhood friend who, along with Briony&#146;s sister, has recently graduated from Cambridge. By the end of that day, the lives of all three have changed forever. Robbie and Cecilia cross a boundary they had never dared to approach and become victims of the younger girl&#146;s scheming imagination, while Briony commits a dreadful crime, the subsequent guilt haunting her entire life. Adapted from Ian McEwan&#146;s novel, it&#146;s been nominated for several awards.

Bacon turns vigilante, then finds himself in way over his head. It&#146;s efficient by-the-numbers revengesploitation enlivened by some jim-dandy action set pieces and the odd jolt of humour, some of it intentional. John Goodman is a hoot as the black-market gun dealer who sells Bacon his ordnance. Underexposed cinematography gives everybody a nice corpse-y look even before the blood begins to flow. If you feel like giving your baser instincts a workout, you could do worse. (Cliff Doerksen)]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Paul Haggis&#146;s state-of-the-nation whodunit about a retired Army lieutenant (Jones) searching for his MIA soldier son isn&#146;t likely to sway the few and the proud who still think the occupation of Iraq is justified. Nor will this angry screed, trumpeting the moral that war dehumanises everyone who participates in it, seem like anything but preaching to the choir for politically progressive audience members. The one thing the movie does extraordinarily well, however, is demonstrate how a truly great actor can lift up a mediocre film. <em>(David Fear)</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Following in the testosterone-sculpted footsteps of Vin Diesel and the Governator, former WWE champ Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) tackles a Disney romp about a tyke-challenged muscleman. Fans of The Rock&#146;s comic chops and considerable Samoan charm might be tickled by his turn as an egocentric quarterback suddenly confronted with an eight-year-old daughter he unwittingly fathered. But this Hail Mary pass at a pro-American football family comedy fumbles logic and reason for the sake of sass attacks and trumpedup kiddie trauma.&#160;<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Four Australian orphans are treated to a Christmas vacation at a remote beach community, and all we got was this treacly, loopy movie. It takes a bold or tin-eared writer to include in one film: a teen romance; a woman dying of cancer; a couple who can&#146;t have children and weigh adoption; a grizzled fisherman and the giant fish he&#146;s been trying to catch for years; a wild horse who wanders in and out of the plot like a big symbolic whatsit; and a guy lying about being a circus performer to impress people. It&#146;s as if four or five different movies are battling for attention.&#160;<br />
<br />
The four orphans (Radcliffe, Byers, Cormie, Fraser) dream of being taken away by new parents, though Radcliffe&#146;s character, Maps (they all have cute nicknames), is pragmatic enough to know that when your balls drop, so do your chances of being adopted. So while the other three spend their holiday competing to see who can charm the childless couple (Hill and Stapleton) and win the adoption sweepstakes, Radcliffe gets a romance with Palmer, the only other teen for miles, who is conveniently hot to trot and has a cool record collection. Meanwhile, the lovable older couple hosting the orphans (Thompson and McQuade) deal with the wife&#146;s impending death, the fisherman dreams big fishy dreams, and the pony makes cameos.&#160;<br />
<br />
With so many threads and so little time, Hardy and his editor cut between scenes with a jumpiness that suggests there&#146;s another hour of material on the cutting-room floor. Not that we want to see any of it.&#160;<br />
<br />

				<description><![CDATA[The title <em>Lust, Caution</em> promises an emotional conflict, but Lee&#146;s follow-up to <em>Brokeback Mountain</em> swings violently between the two modes, offering more than an hour of restrained espionage drama &#150; hushed phone calls, secret assassination plans, several rounds of mahjong &#150; before plunging headlong into its Verhoeven-calibre sex scenes. Regarding those: courting disproportionate hype, Lee has stressed the importance of the sex for character development, which makes sense&#133; if, as here, your characters are woefully underdeveloped.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The pedigree on this drama is impressive: it&#146;s based on a respected Susan Minot novel, the screenplay is by Pulitzer-winner Michael Cunningham (<em>The Hours</em>), it&#146;s directed by noted cinematographer turned- director Lajos Koltai (<em>Fateless</em>), and the cast is like a multi-generation summit conference of notable women. The resulting film, alas, looks distressingly like an ad for a sleep aid, complete with butterflies and fields of tall grass. Dying Ann Lord (Redgrave) recalls in golden-hued flashbacks her great &#145;mistake&#146;, which involved not marrying a blandly hunky doctor she met at the ritzy Newport, Rhode Island, wedding of her best friend in the 1950s. During the weekend, the younger Ann (Danes, pleasant but unimpressive) flirts with the doctor (Wilson, barely registering a pulse) when she&#146;s not propping up her supposed date for the weekend, an alcoholic who hasn&#146;t yet come to terms with his obvious homosexuality (Dancy, more interesting than the role he&#146;s stuck in). Guess which character gets sacrificed to the gods of melodramatic plotting. Meanwhile, in the present, Ann&#146;s daughters (Collette, Richardson) deal with her impending death. Koltai and cinematographer Gyula Pados paint pretty pictures, but this film is about as exciting as watching a particularly tasteful shade of paint dry. There&#146;s mild interest in the fact that the film has several mother-daughter pairs among the cast (Redgrave and Richardson, Streep and Gummer), but it can&#146;t be a good sign that this fact is worth mentioning.

				<description><![CDATA[With Judd Apatow&#146;s comedy crusade in full swing thanks to <em>Knocked Up</em>, it&#146;s only a matter of time before his gentle, geeky characters nuzzle up to a popular backlash &#150; quite possibly from Apatow&#146;s blind spot, women. So call these the salad days, with <em>Superbad</em> the peak of <em>Dorkus primus</em>. Certainly as long as there are movies, there will be pre-collegiate summer-of-getting-laid romps involving the acquisition of beer, babes and, ultimately, wisdom. But even the gang from <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em> will appear Rat Pack-ready compared with <em>Superbad</em>&#146;s sweaty squad: mouth-breather Seth (Hill); intense, anaemic Evan (Cera); and their awkward third wheel, a bespectacled wanksta named Fogell (Mintz-Plasse), aka &#145;McLovin&#146;.&#160;<br />
<br />
Of course, their exploits &#150; which transpire over one night &#150; are adorably awkward. (The co-writers are childhood friends Evan Goldberg and <em>Knocked Up</em>&#146;s Seth Rogen; note those first names.) This is comedy of a liberating nature, about the various indignities that coolness always requires, be it drunkenly smacking your head into an interested girl&#146;s face or befriending a group of basement coke-heads who insist that you sing soul music. When <em>Superbad</em> pokes fun at that pointlessness, it&#146;s endearing. Beyond the central bickering trio, though, there are gauzy areas, such as a pair of clueless cops and the usual lust objects. Perhaps it&#146;s best to regard this movie as it sees itself: a drunken, inept, parking-lot joyride set to Van Halen&#146;s &#145;Panama&#146;, 20 years after that song was cool. Was it ever cool? Aw yeah.&#160;<br />

				<description><![CDATA[You can&#146;t be blamed for seeing <em>The Italian&#146;</em>s underage lead &#150; a blond Euromoppet with a face that could grace a Campbell&#146;s soup can &#150; and thinking that you were in for cherub-cinema sugar shock. But <em>Kolya </em>this isn&#146;t; Andrei Kravchuk hews closer to the spirit of <em>Germany Year Zero</em> (1948, Roberto Rossellini) and <em>Shoeshine</em> (1946, Vittorio De Sica), two movies that wrench your heart, yet never sink under the weight of their own street-urchin tragedies.&#160;<br />
<br />
At the Dickensian orphanage he calls home, Vanya (Spiridonov) hits the jackpot: an Italian couple wants to adopt him. Then a friend&#146;s birth mother shows up, and Vanya&#146;s mind starts to think about his own mother returning to look for him. After sneaking a peek at his fi le, Vanya hits the road. The house madam (Kuznetsova), who doesn&#146;t like losing commissions, is hot on the boy&#146;s trail.&#160;<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, the grimy landscapes and grubby characters don&#146;t automatically qualify Kravchuk&#146;s drama as a downer; there&#146;s an underwhelming slightness to the dour aspects that plays against the prematurely toughened, street-smart youth. But while muted scenarios are always preferable to blatant manipulation, <em>The Italian</em> isn&#146;t entirely satisfying. The movie&#146;s sheen of desperation is ultimately like a shabby coat that, once a hint of sunshine shows up, is too easily discarded.&#160;<br />

				<description><![CDATA[A Frankenstein&#146;s monster of leftovers from <em>The Matrix,</em> Tolkien&#146;s Middle-earth epics and Magic: The Gathering cards, Timur Bekmambetov&#146;s <em>Night Watch</em> (2004) wasn&#146;t just an adaptation of Sergei Lukyanenko and Vladimir Vasiliev&#146;s mega-popular novels. It was also Russia&#146;s attempt to outdo Hollywood with its own homegrown blockbuster borscht &#150; a gambit that translated into mad rubles at the box office.&#160;<br />
<br />
This sequel reprises the original&#146;s concept that if you just throw a lot of cool fantasy ballyhoo together, who cares if coherence becomes collateral damage? Day Watch is what you&#146;d imagine it&#146;s like being stuck inside the head of a geeky 12- year-old boy. Vampires duke it out with super-cops and medieval barbarians, generic n&#252;-metal riffs and DJ breakbeats play in constant loops, and doe-eyed hotties strut around in fetish wear. All that&#146;s missing is a bitchin&#146; <em>Fast and the Furious</em>-style joyride. Actually, scratch that; that&#146;s in there as well.&#160;<br />
<br />
The plot? Once again, the &#145;dark others&#146; and &#145;light others&#146; are on the verge of starting the apocalypse, this time over the One Ring&#133; sorry, the &#145;Chalk of Fate&#146;, which will decide whether evil or good wins. Bekmambetov is currently at work on a third instalment; perhaps it&#146;s time to just say nyet.&#160;<br />

The government uses Randy&#146;s rarefied skill set to infiltrate Feng&#146;s remote island fortress, where each year this enigmatic malefactor hosts an Enter the Dragon-style table-tennis tournament. Predictably absurd, Balls of Fury employs enough comedic talent &#150; Diedrich Bader is brilliant as Feng&#146;s sex slave &#150; to make all the lame spoofing translate into some legitimate laughs. <em>(Drew Toal)</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[After all the published studies and consciousness-raising concerts, is there anybody who still isn&#146;t convinced that our big blue marble is going to hell in a hand-basket? This hectoring ecomentary lays out a litany of testimonials to sway the handful that consider global warming either neoliberal whining or a nonexistent threat. A number of &#145;independent experts on the front line&#146; &#150; a term that encompasses everybody from tribal faith-keepers to Stephen Hawking &#150; theorise that the recent abundance of natural disasters is symptomatic of a larger global breakdown. Corporate interests (cue booing, hissing) have also contributed to untold environmental damage, and human beings must fi nd alternative methods to help an infected Mother Earth. The sky may not be falling, but the rest of the planet is pretty f****d. Nadia Conners and Leila Conners Petersen&#146;s solar-powered jalopy of a doc, however, isn&#146;t a vehicle that&#146;s likely to bring this message to the masses. The duo employs a numbing repetition of form &#150; talking-head interviews, news footage, rinse, repeat &#150; and constantly recycled factoids that grate over time. If there&#146;s a lesson to be learned from The 11th Hour, it&#146;s that a good cause presented without grace ultimately becomes a lost cause.]]></description>

The scenario, based on an Elmore Leonard story, essentially remains unchanged: eager for a $200 reward, a struggling rancher (Bale/Heflin) pledges to escort a notorious bandit (Crowe/Ford) to the train that will take the latter to jail, but must contend with the bad man&#146;s pursuing henchmen.&#160;<br />

				<description><![CDATA[The final part of the videogame-derived &#145;Resident Evil&#146; trilogy is the least boring. Faint praise, perhaps, but one must be grateful for small mercies. Based on a script by series creator Paul WS Anderson, Australian director Russell Mulcahy&#146;s post-apocalyptic movie owes much to countryman George Miller&#146;s &#145;Mad Max&#146; movies. The corpse-regenerating T-Virus, which in the last instalment escaped from the Umbrella Corporation&#146;s underground laboratory to infect the whole of Raccoon City, has now spread across the entire United States. Superhuman Alice (Milla Jovovich) &#150; a beautiful but rebellious by-product of the corporation&#146;s search for an antidote &#150; joins a convoy of vehicles driven by a ragtag band of human survivors. The crazed Dr Isaacs (Iain Glen) keeps an eye on them, using the corporation&#146;s all-seeing satellite surveillance system, as they roam the Nevada desert and sand-swept Las Vegas streets in search of food, water and fuel. Until Alice decides it&#146;s time to settle the score with her mad-scientist creator once and for all.
The plot is every bit as episodic and nonsensical as before, but &#145;Extinction&#146; ups the ante by introducing some new and/or improved adversaries: a murder of mutant crows, who prefer live flesh to carrion; a new breed of killer dogs; &#145;Super Undead&#146; zombies that are more fleet of foot; and a squidgy, tentacled monster called The Tyrant. Amid the choreographed fights, loud explosions and CG creatures, there are some new and old faces. But the scariest visage is that of Alice, whose flawless, airbrushed complexion is either a throwback to Mulcahy&#146;s New Romantic pop promos or something dictated by Jovovich&#146;s L&#146;Or&#233;al contract.]]></description>

				<title>The Willow Tree</title>

				<description><![CDATA[The ‘be careful what you wish for’ maxim
is easily applicable to all timeworn conventions.
What redeems The Willow Tree
from collapsing into complete melodrama
is director Majid Majidi’s preternatural
ability to capture the world’s ethereal
dimensions. This film’s cautionary tale
may look bathetic – but just as its protagonist
discovers, looks are deceiving.
Majidi first used blindness as a
premise in The Color of Paradise (1999),
featuring a sightless boy with a father
embarrassed by his son’s lack of vision.
This time around, the blind character
is Youssef (Parastui), a middle-aged
professor who could see when he was a
child. Happily married with a daughter,
Youssef still harbours resentment
toward God for taking his vision – until
a medical procedure in Paris restores his
sight. And that’s when the trouble begins. The Willow Tree works as a metaphor
for how different cultures give people
a keener view of their own lives, or as
a warning to those who invest all their
hopes into one myopic dream, or even as
a test of religious devotion. The film has
its flaws (Majidi, a winner of the 2001
Hamburg Film Festival’s Douglas Sirk
Award, tends toward the maudlin), but
his gift for giving a cinematic texture to
the emotional senses validates his work
as a visionary. Stephen Garrett]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The rom-com formula gets a weirdly
subdued treatment from Hicks (the good
Shine, the bad Snow Falling on Cedars).
Zeta-Jones plays Kate Armstrong, a successful
but overly work-oriented chef in
a New York bistro. She’s so driven that
her boss (Clarkson) insists that she see a
shrink (Balaban). Kate is that old cliché:
the professional woman who needs to
be loosened up by the love of a man
with an overabundance of joie de vivre.
Sure enough, into her life walks Nick
(Eckhart), a chef who she thinks is trying
to take her job. He leads the kitchen staff
in singalongs, tells funny stories and
generally makes her seem like an uptight
bitch. What throws this script off the usual
rom-com path is the presence of Kate’s niece Zoe (Breslin), whom Kate must take
care of after a car accident kills Zoe’s
mum. Kate has to learn how to adjust her
life to include a grieving little girl, while
also juggling a kitchen rivalry-turnedromance.
Both relationships are meant to
teach Kate to lighten up and take life as it
comes. (Why must Hollywood continue
to punish professional women for being
successful?) It’s perfectly harmless and
intermittently moving, but the leads are
both oddly miscast. Zeta-Jones delivers a
monologue about the proper preparation
of quail with the seductive but neutral
clarity of an advertising spokeswoman,
but we never fully buy her passion for
food. And Eckhart telegraphs Nick’s
‘quirky charm’, but gives the distinct
feeling that he was thrown into a role
written for someone else. Things work
themselves out, tears and laughs are
called forth at appropriate intervals, and
all you’re likely to muster when the credits
roll is a shrug. Hank Sartin]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Now would be the perfect moment for
Lindsay Lohan to knock us out with the
kind of performance she’s capable of.
As it happens, this bizarre thriller is ten
times more fascinating as an accidental
piece of private exposure, one that ends
with Lohan literally digging her own
grave to find another dark-haired, husky
starlet staring up at her.
A hallucinatory psychodrama that
owes more to Mulholland Drive than to
Captivity, the movie has Lohan straddling
two roles (as in life): good girl Aubrey,
a piano student and football player’s crush, suffers a particularly gruesome
abduction that costs her an arm and a leg;
she then takes on the identity of bad girl
Dakota, a former pole dancer and maneater.
Aubrey’s parents tear themselves
apart during her unraveling, detectives
scowl, and ‘Dakota’ decides to hobble her
way to her torturer’s identity.
The imagery is fi lled with feverish
symbols of lost potency: multiple
hand-loppings, a hairless cat, Lohan’s
own excessive profanity and desperate
grinding. I don’t attribute a creative
intelligence to such a perfect match of
material and actor – how would Lohan
even know to choose it? But this will
undoubtedly be the key film of her career:
a scared expression of total meltdown.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Let’s get one thing clear: there is nothing
questionable about heterosexual actor
John Travolta clad in a fat suit, dragged
up in pink sequins and breathily trilling
‘I’m the cutest chickie that you ever did
see!’ There is, however, something awkward
and faintly disturbing about watching
his Edna Turnblad dance and duet
with Christopher Walken’s Mr Turnblad
dressed in toreador kitsch. Divine it
ain’t. In fact, so peculiarly mannered is
Edna’s transformation from chipmunky
homebody to liberated blob that it’s quite
impossible to forget you’re watching
John Travolta in latex and, therefore, to
suspend disbelief. Nor is that made any
easier by uncertain, sometimes clashing
performances from such other big names
as Michelle Pfeiffer, Queen Latifah and
indeed Walken, whose dance skills are
criminally underused. That said, this new
Hairspray – adapted from the Broadway musical based on the 1988 film – is often
great fun. Though not as scabrous, as
sharp or even as musically memorable
as John Waters’ original, it retains much
of his filthy, big-hearted sensibility (he
cameos as a happy flasher) and is less
deadeningly stagey than that other recent
fi lm-of-the-musical-of-the-film,
The Producers. Ben Walters]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Stephen King, the author
of this source material, has already done
haunted hotels. So the idea of stretching
what was simply supposed to be a dessert
course (a short story in King’s 2000
audiobook ‘Blood and Smoke’) to a full meal
speaks more to Hollywood appetites than the
proper dictates of drama. The tale is skimpy,
mostly set in a New York City suite that,
despite its bustling midtown location, is said
to host unspeakable evil – and it doesn’t even
have Wi-Fi.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Godard’s first feature, adapted from an existing
scenario written by François Truffaut,
spins a pastiche with pathos as joyrider
Belmondo shoots a cop, chases friends and debts across night-time Paris, and falls in
love with a literary lady. Seberg quotes books
and ideas and names; Belmondo measures
his profile against Bogart’s, pawns a stolen
car, and talks his girlfriend into a cash
loan ‘just til midday’. The camera lavishes
black-and-white love on Paris, strolling up
the Champs-Elysées, edging across cafe
terraces, sweeping over the rooftop skyline,
Mozart mixing with cool jazz riffs in the night
air. The ultimate film noir noir noir...until
Belmondo pulls his own eyelids shut when he
dies. More than any other, this was the film
which epitomised the iconoclasm of the early
Nouvelle Vague – not least in its insolent use
of the jump-cut.]]></description>

years, but The Simpsons, the phenomenally
successful animated sitcom, has finally made
the transition to the big screen. Homer, Marge,

				<description><![CDATA[Dir Satoshi Kon 2006. Japan. 90 mins. In Japanese, with subtitles. Voices of Megumi Hayashibara, Akio Otsuk.

There’s no shortage of intellectual concepts being bandied about in this anime tour of the subconscious by Satoshi Kon (Millennium Actress), which centers on a Cronenbergian device (picture a cross between an iPod and a dental tool) that can tap into dreams. Jungian notions of the collective unconscious collide into Media Studies 101 territory, debates rage about the disconnect between philosophy and technology, geopolitical sound bites are thrown in for good measure (‘All terrorists are desperate’) and characters’ REM cycles get the semiotic treatment. Japan’s manga masters have always taken their toons seriously, but this is the kind of sci-fithat practically requires a Ph.D. to fully appreciate.

Of course, nothing here is particularly easy to digest, which ends up being both a distinction and a curse. Paprika’s narrative starts out fairly simple – someone has stolen the dream machine, a cop (Otsuka) and a therapist (Hayashibara) try to find out whodunit – and soon twists itself into labyrinthine loops. Even the doppelgängers start developing doppelgängers. Luckily, the sumptuous visual palette will blow your mind whether you can keep up or not, as parades of appliances and creepy-cutesy animals turn into elaborate psychedelic tableaux. Yet, like other overly ambitious anime, it’s all too much and not enough. Kon crams so many elements from modern J-cyberpulp, detective stories and The Chomsky Reader into the framework that by the end you can feel the seams bursting. When there’s this much spice and food for thought on one plate, how are you expected to taste anything at all?

				<description><![CDATA[Dir Judd Apatow 2006. USA. 129 mins. M18. Seth Rogen, Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd.

A big, fat, gooey smile fixes itself to your face early on in Knocked Up, an impossibly sweet and unerringly sympathetic comedy of misfortune. As writer-director Judd Apatow’s follow-up to The 40 Year-Old Virgin, the movie also has the good sense to often be dorky. Apatow’s strength has always been his patience for freaks and geeks mustering confidence in a too-cool world. But what may make Knocked Up even more audacious than Virgin isn’t just its neat reversal of the premise – these characters are a bit too lucky in the sack – but its elegant transition over the course of two hours into a rare realm of American humor, where comedy becomes philosophy.

Ben (Rogen, in a career-making performance) takes his habitual stoning and movie-tits ogling seriously – as does Alison (Heigl) her chirpy, blonde ascent to celebrity-interviewer quasi-stardom. They’re not meant to hook up, but that’s exactly what happens one drunken night on the dance floor; two months later, what Ben assumes to be a booty call is actually a tense status report, each panicking into accusations. (Apatow’s ear for dialogue has, if anything, sharpened; he also ducks the obvious abortion angle with a bit of visual humor in front of an ultrasound that heralds stronger directing chops.) Deciding to grow into intimacy, the two eventually reach the demystified end of romance, the script adding realness with every turn. Ultimately the film says that fate has a way of kicking you up a notch, if you can somehow let yourself rise to the occasion (very scary, and not just to breeders). Apatow can certainly claim this to be true.

				<description><![CDATA[Dir Scott Wiper 2007. USA. 114mins. Steve Austin, Vinnie Jones, Rick Hoffman.

Opening with the ominous words, ‘a WWE Films production’, The Condemned can hardly be accused of straying from its core values. The pleasingly simple premise involves ten death-row inmates from around the world, including one played by wrestler Steve Austin (no longer Stone Cold, apparently), who are whisked away to an unnamed Pacific island where they will be made to fight to the death over the course of 30 hours, after which the sole survivor will be released. Holed up in a war room on the far end of the island, a small staff led by an egotistical young producer reminiscent of Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Francis, broadcasts the carnage live over the Internet and tracks the show’s ‘exposure’ on blogs and chatrooms, in pursuit of an FA Cup final-sized audience.

The underlying message, of course, is that it’s very, very wrong to exploit real-life violence as entertainment, a point returned to intermittently between scenes of contestants being impaled, burned alive and blown to pieces. The final-act descent into smug moralism might be easier to take if the movie didn’t proceed to contradict itself with one last spectacularly staged killing. The Condemned never quite succeeds in implicating the viewer in the consumption of vio-lent spectacle, although one uncomfortable control-room moment in which the crew can get only a single grainy view of what appears to be a brutal rape-murder successfully mines the aesthetic differences between entertainment and snuff. As for Austin, he’s got a long way to go to be as good as The Rock.

				<description><![CDATA[Dir Auraeus Solito 2005. Philippines. 100 mins. NC16. Nathan Lopez, Soliman Cruz, JR Valentin, Neil Ryan, Ping Medina.

There aren’t many love stories about a rookie cop and a 12-year-old boy, but in many ways that’s what young Filipino director Auraeus Solito’s debut feature offers. Maxi (Nathan Lopez) is an unapologetically effeminate Manila lad, who gets on surprisingly well with his gangster pa (Soliman Cruz) and street-thug brothers, teasing each other or taking in a DVD in the modest home that Maxi keeps with pride when not swishing fabulously around the slum streets. Tension arrives in the beefy shape of new man on the force, Victor (JR Valentin), who presents Maxi with an appealingly robust model of manhood by determining to overcome the laissez-faire corruption that, problematically, allows his family to thrive. The bond that develops between the two is affectionate and intense enough to get tongues wagging at home and down at the station, where Victor’s zeal is almost as unwelcome as it is on the street. Made on a shoestring with generous help from friends and family, Blossoming is not without its rough edges: Michiko Yamamoto’s script sets up some intriguing conflicts, but comes to a somewhat fumbled climax. But the occasionally handmade feel – hand-drawn credit sequence and all – works to the film’s benefit. It’s hard to resist the raucous, vivacious tone encapsulated in its bold, vibrant wardrobe and set dressing and Lopez’s charming and affecting pivotal performance, all of which yield a vivid sense of a capital city rarely seen on screen. Solito also has a cheeky cinephilic sensibility: the haughty chutzpah of the closing homage to The Third Man is worth the admission alone.

Goaded out of retirement for an exhibition round against the current It fighter, Balboa is told to rely on ‘brute force’. Which is exactly what Stallone does, unleashing greatest-hits moments like H-bombs. Cue Bill Conti’s instantly recognisable theme, commence training montage and start pounding the meat! The actor-director doles out the expected treats in pat populist doses, but that doesn’t make this attempt at milking punch-drunk love from the past exciting, just numbingly predictable.

				<description><![CDATA[Remember ‘Just the Two of Us’, Will Smith’s sensitive man rap paean to fathers and sons on the 1997 album ‘Big Willie Style’? The former Fresh Prince is tugging at similar heartstrings with his new, unfortunately titled movie. Sporting a vintage Jesse Jackson moustache, Smith plays Chris Gardner, a struggling salesman whose wife walks out, leaving him to care for his son (Smith’s real-life progeny, Jaden) even as they slide into homelessness. Despite the canned uplift of this rags-to-riches tale, there’s something nonetheless affecting about it. (Tom Beer)]]></description>

Cate Blanchett. Though she’s abetted
by Blanchett’s own emotionally volatile
portrayal, Dench’s performance is the main
attraction in this predatory psychodrama.
There isn’t much else, really: Eyre’s direction
merely plays up the melodramatic aspects
of Zoë Heller’s novel, screenwriter Patrick
Marber’s acidic dialogue occasionally slips
into the overwritten, and the rest of the cast
chews table scraps. (DF)]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Since Clint is now taking the Japanese perspective (respectfully and with great curiosity), his latest makes us ask: Was ‘Flags of Our Fathers’ actually from the American one? Maybe in a fashion. But it seemed more from the perspective of an alien race better known as ‘Publicitus flackus’ – a film about how wars get sold. ‘Letters’, on the other hand, is less timely, a solid war picture, humane, a little dull. There is a certain poetic fatality to siding with the losers, and Eastwood directs some sensitive performances across the language barrier. (JR)]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Animated bedtime stories now have to be full of contemporary pop-cultural references (thanks a lot, ‘Shrek’!), but these revisionist toons should also be semi-watchable, a modest goal that is way beyond this plasticine prop’s grasp. In Fairytaleland, Cinderella (Gellar), a doting servant (Prinze) and the requisite wisecracking animals have to save the day. Quality-controlled this ain’t: the computerised animation is cut-rate; the script keeps piling on clunkier jokes; and Prinze proves he isn’t any better an actor in two dimensions than he is in three.

				<description><![CDATA[Rookie teacher Erin Gruwell (Swank) turned her at-risk students around by giving them journals in which to write about their experiences growing up hard. It’s an inspiring tale, but LaGravenese’s movie is a prime example of why filmgoers reflexively wince when they hear the phrase ‘based on a true story’. A determination to forcefully uplift audiences with emotional cheap shots is one thing, but what’s unforgivable is the dramatic laziness. Everybody is reduced to caricatures, while the Oscar-winning actor turns the movie into ‘To Swank, with Love’. (David Fear)]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Hugh Jackman plays a brilliant, driven surgeon to Rachel Weisz’s gorgeous, suffering wife; he struggles to find a cure for her brain tumour while their cello-scored cryfest is alternately reconfigured as a conquistadorial quest for the Fountain of Youth (also starring Jackman and Weisz) and a far-flung future in which bald yoga devotees get to float in outer space with trees. Clearly the auteur is ‘Learning to Let Go’. And when such individuals are allowed to make multimillion-dollar movies with their Oscar-winning girlfriends, you have to wonder if a certain part of the entertainment equation gets left behind.

				<description><![CDATA[Josh Duhamel, Melissa George. In fairness, this stink bomb’s central idea – sexed-up white tourists preyed upon by scary organ harvesters while on vacation in Brazil – has symbolic resonance in these xenophobic times. Alas, the prevailing intelligence that might have made it a bit more self-aware (à la ‘Hostel’) is AWOL. The real forebears of ‘Turistas’ are the Italian ‘cannibal’ films of the 1970s and ’80s, wherein white people enter the jungle, display some ugly tendencies and are mercilessly tortured by Amazonians. ‘Turistas’ keeps the racism and adds a happy ending.

				<description><![CDATA[Barrels of bullets, piles of broken glass and scores of shredded-toribbons corpses all add to the sound and fury of writer-director Joe Carnahan’s spectacularly shallow spectacle of a mob-hit movie. Not a fresh idea emerges from this risible exercise in muscle-car camerawork, squib-crazy shoot-outs and self-admiring pyrotechnics, in which Las Vegas magician-turned-mafioso Buddy ‘Aces’ Israel (Piven) is the target of a quadruple contract when his betrayal of a Cosa Nostra fossil makes him a marked man. ‘Make it make sense,’ one character pleads, in the film’s most unintentionally knowing dialogue.

It’s a frenetic enterprise, but it does at least address the spectre of adoption in a sensitive way. To date, dweebish orphan Lewis has been through 124 adoption interviews; his propensity for inventing things that go wrong is the reason for his latest rejection]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Toby Jones, Daniel Craig. The idea that tiny, shawl-draped Truman Capote could inspire twin biopics within a year, both of them moody and atmospheric, strains credulity. As it happens, ‘Infamous’ is not a copycat project, just a victim of unfortunate timing; its script is possibly even more daring than that of ‘Capote’. But the shadow of Philip Seymour Hoffman’s total transformation looms large, and though Toby Jones’s swishier performance hardly represents the challenge failed, the new movie is just not distinguished enough to constitute a worthy addition to the myth. Sandra Bullock’s high-school-playaccented Harper Lee doesn’t help]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[De Niro’s sophomore directorial effort condenses the CIA’s long history of dirty tricks into a single spy’s downward spiral. Edward Wilson (Damon) is the sort of Yalie who gets cherry-picked for secret society Skull and Bones and attracts a shrill, shrewish trophy wife (Jolie); he’s also emotionally sealed off enough to pique the interest of the government’s new special-ops recruiters. De Niro juggles the myriad bigpicture parts (Cuba, the Congo) with reserved professionalism; it’s the central character, ironically, that’s the movie’s Achilles’ heel. How can someone sell his soul when you haven’t given him a discernible soul in the fist place?]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The plot sounds all too familiar: an ex-marksman living in exile gets conned back into the service only to be set up and forced to go on the run with a nationwide manhunt behind him. The only difference is… well, there is none. The sucker this time is Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg), a former Army sniper who leaves the military after a mission goes bad.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) is just your ordinary dog-catcher until his missus (Virginia Madsen) gives him a curious paperback, ‘The Number 23’. As he reads on, it’s like looking inside his head, as the lonely boy protagonist becomes a moody detective, Walter’s own unfulfilled ambition. Soon, however, his fictional alter-ego’s mind-addling obsession with the number 23 leads to kinky sex, suicide and murder. How so? Well, what with birth dates both personal and famous (Shakespeare, Kurt Cobain) totalling the magic numeral, not to mention other ‘coincidences’, the maddening ubiquity of  the number pitches the gumshoe right over the edge, setting up the possibility that the same fate lies in store for Walter. The conceit has a buzz-factor, and an intriguing first half-hour draws us in to the so-called ‘23 Enigma’. But turning this into a workable plot is beyond writer Fernley Phillips, as spiralling events tumble into inconsequentiality, and gestures towards moral seriousness prove ill-founded. (Trevor Johnston). In cinemas now.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Could someone please stage a Diane Keaton intervention? This terrific actor must be steered toward better material (admittedly the Holy Grail for ladies of  a certain age in Hollywood these days). Directors? Please exercise some restraint with Ms Keaton; less is always more. And while we’re at it, how about a moratorium on playing nightmare moms? Everyone here is a caricature, and the gaps are papered over with hyperactive shtick. I haven’t seen so many cakes dropped or smashed since ‘I Love Lucy.’ (Tom Beer) In cinemas now. ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[22-year-old Clay Beresford (Christensen) has it all: money, power, business savvy, daddy issues, bum ticker. But life at the top stops for no one &#150; a donor heart comes through, and Clay defies his widowed mother&#146;s (Olin) slick-surgeon recommendation, entrusting his friend (Howard) with the cutting. Sam Lockwood (Alba), Clay&#146;s hottie-bo-bottie lady, remains dutifully by his side despite his mother&#146;s disapproval. Surgery begins; Clay&#146;s awake and unable to move, but he sure as hell feels pain. Harold&#146;s film contains more than enough &#150; that being more than none &#150; of the ensuing mind-screams (&#145;Hey! I&#146;m awake! Aaaaah! That hurts!!!&#146; is nearverbatim), and the conspiracy theory against Clay, which he overhears while under the knife, is painstakingly predictable. Still, we can&#146;t deny the flick a few surprises along the way, even if we have to suffer through Christensen&#146;s Anakin Skywalker-on-Valium existence. (Steve Heisler)]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[We&#146;re only a few months in to 2007, and already we&#146;ve got a solid contender for the worst movie of the year: Nick Cassavetes&#146;s cruddy &#145;Alpha Dog&#146;. Smuggled into theatres a year after it closed the Sundance Film Festival, &#145;Alpha Dog&#146; is based on the true story of Jesse James Hollywood, a rich Southern Californian creep who was one the youngest people ever on the FBI&#146;s mostwanted list.Sybaritic, monosyllabic, wealthy adolescent Angelenos play at being baddies, led by head cretin Johnny Truelove (Hirsch). Meth-addled Jake (Foster) hasn&#146;t paid Johnny the dollars he owes him, so he kidnaps Jake&#146;s kid brother with the help of henchman Frankie (Timberlake). Treading disastrously on the teenage wasteland already fetishised in a million Larry Clark movies, &#145;Alpha Dog&#146; scratches its balls and sniffs its own butt, cynically playing its noxious characters and story line as rough indie cred. Even Clark&#146;s prurience toward his dead-end kids is far nobler than Cassavetes&#146;s pathetic slumming in thug life.Note to Timberlake: nine-minute music videos are far kinder to your talents than a feature-length movie. But then again, even those performers born before the Reagan administration cluelessly endure their ignominies: Bruce Willis with bad hair plugs, Sharon Stone in a fat suit, Harry Dean Stanton with a potty mouth. &#145;Alpha Dog&#146; will leave you reaching for the beta-blockers.]]></description>

				<title>The Dead Girl</title>

				<description><![CDATA[A clutch of overwrought vignettes linked by the death of a prostitute at the hands of a serial killer, ‘Dead’ opens with the wonderful Collette doing that mousy, repressed thing that unimaginative casting directors see as her raison d’être. Hag-ridden by her shrewish mom (Laurie, recycling all her bits from‘Carrie’ but the phrase ‘dirty pillows’), she takes a walk, fi nds the corpse and reports it. The creep who bags her groceries (Ribisi) recognises her from the TV news, and they return to the crime scene for unwholesome sex.

The subsequent chapter features Byrne as a forensic technician whose yen for closure feeds her hope that the dead girl will turn out to be her missing sister. The baton next goes to Hurt, unrecognisably dowdy as a nagging wife who discovers that her husband (Searcy) is a bigger heel than she ever imagined. Next up is Harden as the deceased’s mother, belatedly seeking to understand how her girl went so wrong and fi nding the standard explanatory skeleton in the family closet. Rounding out the bill is Murphy as the doomed hooker, who’s trying to do right by her toddler daughter.

Harrowing in an off-the-rack kind of way, ‘Dead’ is to female victimhood what ‘Crash’ was to racism, minus (to its credit) the shiny uplift.
