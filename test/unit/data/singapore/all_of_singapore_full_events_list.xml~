				<description><![CDATA[19-20 Feb - &#145;Chingay has come a long way from being a Chinese cultural parade with lion dancing, big-headed dolls and giant fl ags,&#146; says parade chairman Nah Juay Hng of the People&#146;s Association (PA). Next to the National Day Parade in August, the Chingay Parade is a must-see Singaporean spectacular held annually to welcome the Chinese New Year. A resoundingly loud and vibrant affair, it showcases live acts by thousands of performers, giant neon-lit fl oats and all-night-long parties the public can participate in. <br />
<br />
Traditionally held along Orchard Road, this year&#146;s Chingay will move to the F1 Pit Building, allowing for more ticketed seats &#150; 18,000 per night, compared to 8,000 per night in 2009 &#150; and more standing space for non-ticketed spectators who&#146;ll still be able to get an eyeful of what&#146;s going on. &#145;Try standing along the sides of the parade route after the F1 Pit Building and behind the Singapore Flyer,&#146; enthuses Nah. To get you into the CNY spirit, here are our top fi ve highlights for this year&#146;s Chingay Parade. <br />
<br />
<strong>1 PARTIES GALORE </strong><br />
For the fi rst time, Chingay 2010 will host a carnival, Chingay Passion PAssar, on the grounds beside the Singapore Flyer. Starting from 3pm, spectators can enjoy grog and grub; be entertained by buskers, stilt walkers, magicians, balloonists and caricature artists; rent a costume; or have pictures taken with Chingay, Cosplay and Star Wars characters &#150; all before the parade starts at 8pm. The carnival will continue after the parade and will last till midnight on Friday and 3am on Saturday. Over at the Pit Building, there&#146;ll be two other parties held on Saturday after the parade: one will be a street jam party with DJs spinning hip hop and R&#38;B grooves, while the other is set to be a no-less-energetic folk and line dancing hoe-down. Be warned: both parties are expected to attract some 5,000 revellers. <br />
<br />
<strong>2 CRACKIN&#146; DRAGONS</strong> <br />
Lest anyone forget the very international- looking Chingay is fi rst and foremost a Chinese New Year parade, the event will kick off with a fi ery performance by the famous Firecracker Dragons from Guangxi in south-west China. Unlike traditional dragon dances, this one will be performed by dancers skilfully stepping through lit strands of fi recrackers! A pulsating way to bring in the Year of the Tiger. <br />
<strong><br />
3 SAMBA SINGAPORE-STYLE</strong><br />
A touch of Rio will be seen via Singapore&#146;s version of the Samba Parade. Beginning at the Pit Building and featuring authentic samba rhythms as well as a fusion of local ethnic drums, some 2,000 performers clad in a rainbow of colours will sashay their way through the parade accompanied by a string of glittering fl oats. <br />
<br />
<strong>4 HIGH BAMBOO FEATS</strong> <br />
&#145;Up&#146; is the word for the 300 members of the PA Youth Movement (PAYM) who will create a precedent in Chingay by performing, for the very fi rst time, gravity-defying ladder stunts on 6m-tall bamboo ladders suspended high above the streets. Comprising mainly youths aged between 14 and 30, the contingent will also be accompanied by a 7m-wide fl oat (the widest in Chingay history), featuring a group of drummers pounding furiously on tribal drums. <br />
<br />
<strong>5 UNIVERSAL APPEAL </strong><br />
Don&#146;t miss the grand fi nale, which is touted to be the grandest in the parade&#146;s history. Among the anchor performers is newcomer Resorts World Sentosa. The Integrated Resort and its Chingay contribution is set to give everyone a glimpse of the fl air and vibrancy associated with it, with no fewer than 100 characters from Universal Studios accompanied by an 18m-long fl oat. So, just how fancy is it going to be? Andrea Teo, Resorts World Sentosa&#146;s vice-president of entertainment, says: &#145;Being one of the fi nal fl oats in the contingent, I only have one word to describe it &#150; it&#146;ll be nothing less than spectacular!&#146; (But that&#146;s six words&#133;) <br />
<br />

In this instance it refers to the 20 different artists coming together in what will be the first exhibition featuring the photography majors from NTU&#146;s school of Art, Design &#38; Media.

But this granddaddy continues to deliver the Balearic sound and its unique Mambo Jambo beat (Wednesdays) to Singapore.

The custom-built sound system (courtesy of Systems by Shorty USA) and proprietor/ nightlife veteran Michael Lu&#146;s taste for cultclassic DJ&#146;s deliver the biggest beats. This month check out Chicago legend, Frankie Knuckles (see Previews).]]></description>

				<title>Singapore really has got talent! (KF Seetoh, Janice Wong)</title>

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - <strong>KF Seetoh, 46, Creator of hawker-stall bible <em>Makansutra </em></strong>
Possibly the greatest champion of our island&#146;s humble hawker fare, KF Seetoh is the man to trust when hunting down the dishes that are &#145;die die must try&#146;. Not content with convincing Singaporeans of the culinary gems found here, this charismatic individual has brought a global spotlight to our local staples &#150; chilli crab, char kway teow and chicken rice &#150; and our country.
<strong>On his prot&#233;g&#233;e Janice:</strong> &#145;This little lady is gutsy. I heard about her through Chubby Hubby&#146;s Aun Koh and within ten minutes of meeting her, I can tell in her eyes and demeanour, she&#146;s not in this game for fame or even fortune, she wants to prove a point to herself and does not give a damn about others. Her journey, to me, has no end, and that&#146;s the real challenge and joy in going anywhere &#150; the journey, not the destination.&#146;
<strong>Upcoming projects:</strong> <em>The 2010 editions of Makansutra for Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia are in the works, and the Makansutra Masters Food Village will be launched at the Marina Bay Sands.</em>
<strong>JANICE WONG, 26, <em>Dessert chef </em></strong>
Starting your own restaurant, much less a dessert bar, at the age of 24 takes guts. But twoand- a-half years later, pint-size Janice Wong has proven that she&#146;s got culinary chops to be reckoned with. Set to represent Singapore as the single Asian entrant for the prestigious Madrid Fusion competition in Spain later this month, Janice&#146;s &#145;inner calling&#146; is now coming full circle.
<strong>How did you come up with the concept of 2am : dessertbar?</strong>
I noticed there were a lot of late-night people who loved desserts but no fi ne-dining spot to go to, or a place where desserts were paired with wine. What career goals do you have? Right now, it&#146;s just 2am. For myself, I want to excel to be the best pastry chef in Singapore, and in Asia. It&#146;s already an achievement for me to be picked for the upcoming Madrid Fusion [Ferran Adri&#224; is the head judge] competition.
<strong>What will you be showing there? </strong>
I can&#146;t disclose the Madrid Fusion dessert yet, but I will be doing a jasmine rice lemongrass sorbet with touches of kalamansi.
<strong>Any tips for the next generation? </strong>
Speaking on behalf of women, I have to say it was tough coming out on my own and doing everything, but you need to keep focus and know what you are doing. Show them the passion, more work than just speech&#133; Don&#146;t hold yourself back. I was 24 when I fi rst started. While I was young, I knew it was the right thing to do. Once you jump into things, there is no turning back.
<strong>Upcoming projects:</strong> Janice will be demonstrating her creative culinary skills at the upcoming Madrid Fusion showcase (www.ma dridfusion.net) later this month in Spain.
<strong>Janice&#146;s recommendations </strong>
Cookbook: <em>The Flavour Bible</em> &#145;If you want to be inspired, just fl ip through it and you&#146;ll have a lot of different ingredients to work with.&#146;
Hawker stall: <em>Heng Kee Curry Chicken</em> <em>(#01-1271 Hong Lim Food Centre, Blk 531A Upper Cross St)</em> &#145;It&#146;s super-famous and has been there for over 20 years. They close once the food runs out.&#146;]]></description>

The site is an open platform, which means anyone can put up a profi le advertising rentable space (there are even ads for treehouse stays). Offering shelter all across the US and UK, as well as Korea, the Netherlands, Brazil, France, Italy and even Morocco, the concept differs from rival CouchSurfi ng.com by charging for each listing. For some this is a reassuring process, a tacit guarantee of goods and services; for others it&#146;s a moneymaking opportunity knocking at the door.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[07 Jan-30 Nov1999 - Yes, if there was an Oscar for questionable or crass titles, this would be the runaway winner. But bear with us, for the comedic talents of Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito shouldn&#146;t be underestimated. Owen (DeVito) is a friendless, frustrated wannabe mystery writer. As if things were not bad enough, he has been cursed with a domineering mother (Anne Ramsey) who would make him tear his hair out, if he had any. Having reached the limits of his tolerance, Owen strikes a deal with his writing teacher Larry (Crystal), promising to help him kill the latter&#146;s ex-wife, which Larry will then reciprocate by killing Owen&#146;s mother. While DeVito and Crystal are expert practitioners of their comic craft, Ramsey steals their thunder, portraying a woman so hateful she&#146;ll convince you she deserved to be done away with. Now that&#146;s good acting.

				<description><![CDATA[10 Jan-30 Nov1999 - Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) stars as a single working mother in California whose son is kidnapped. A police investigation is conducted, resulting in the boy seemingly being found and returned to his mother. Much to Christine&#146;s horror though, it&#146;s not her son, even though the boy himself insists otherwise to the police. At first, she is dismissed by the cops as delusional, but when she continues to insist it&#146;s a case of mistaken identity, a much wider conspiracy is revealed. This heart-rending tale of a miscarriage of justice is made all the more poignant because it is based on a true story &#150; and kudos to Jolie, who plays very convincingly the role of a sorrowful, wronged mother.

This new series details the travails of one Ray Drecker &#150; a one-time high-school sports star who&#146;s now a washed-up basketball coach. With his marriage dissolved and money increasingly hard to come by, Drecker does what a desperate, well-endowed man would do in his position &#150; make use of his best asset. Don&#146;t judge the series by its tawdrysounding storyline, for it deals very cleverly with topical issues like the US housing market and the global financial crisis in twisted, darkly comical fashion.

There are a wide variety of age groups to pick from, and the kids will be taught the contact elements of the sport, and pick up necessary skills like teamwork, leadership, decision-making and self-confidence.

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - Sexually speaking, how did Singapore do this year? Apparently, we are having sex an average of 85 times a year and for 15.2 minutes each session; only the French (most unexpected) and Indians spend less time copulating. Singapore aside, the fourth instalment of the Durex Sexual Wellbeing Global Survey, themed &#145;Knowledge and Education&#146;, found that what was most lacking in our sex education is &#145;the emotional aspects of sex&#146;, which include love, respect and the shared enjoyment of giving pleasure to your partner. Furthermore, less than half of the Singaporeans surveyed feel they have received enough advice and information in order to get the very best from their relationships. Meanwhile, 60 per cent of Singaporeans who had undertaken formal sex education said they are satisfied with their overall sexual wellbeing. Conclusion: knowledge is power.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - As an editor, I have succumbed to the majority of Singapore&#146;s spas &#150; I know, it&#146;s a hard-knock life. During these gruelling assignments, I have made it a point to prevent any faults from slipping under my radar. So it is with great pleasure and pride that I announce my first five-star rating: the treatment I underwent floored me with its effectiveness. I know because I showed up sleep deprived, sun damaged, and to top it all off, due to host a hen party that very same night.
I relayed all of the above to my therapist Megawati as I nestled into the extra-spacious, heated spa bed. As she fiddled with buttons to ensure the bed was fitted to the contours of my body (very cool!), she assured me that I would emerge glowing -- I remained sceptical.
I could wax lyrical about the next 75 minutes, but why not zero in on what set this facial apart. Firstly, the extraction process: I&#146;ve never enjoyed this part of any facial, and the Bliss method &#150; no steamer or metal extractor is used &#150; of manually grabbing your skin and pushing out the dirt was just as uncomfortable as it sounds. Luckily it&#146;s effective and left minimal marks.
Next comes the application of the oxygen mask. Once applied, your face is covered with plastic cling wrap, before a few warm towels are draped across your face and neck. Instead of feeling the onsets of claustrophobia, I found myself snoring quietly &#150; although this could be due to the excellent hand and foot massage administered while the mask set in.
Finally, the pi&#232;ce de r&#233;sistance, the oxygen blast of vitamin A, C and E using the Echo2 Oxygen Treatment machine. If you compare my face to a dirty floor, this machine was a K&#228;rcher high-pressure cleaner, stripping my skin of any residual dirt.
The result? I arrived blotchy and with bags under my eyes, yet I emerged with face taut and silky smooth to the touch. My skin glowed like it&#146;d never glowed before.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - Bikram original hot yoga may sound like something you should only do on a cold day, but it&#146;s actually one of the most popular forms of the ancient Indian exercise. Hollywood A-listers like George Clooney and Madonna have been smitten with this workout form, which is conducted in studios heated to a minimum of 41 degrees. While it may seem like enrolling in torture, the heat helps get rid of toxins in your body and increases your flexibility. If you&#146;re in the mood for something a little less steamy, try other classes that specialise in Bollywood dance, sunrise yoga or yogalates, which combines yoga with Pilates.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - Direct from New York comes this cult hair brand. Before you (and your crowning glory) burst into cheers, here&#146;s the downside -- it&#146;s only available at T3, Changi Airport. Still, better there than nowhere&#133; Load your locks with their first-ever hair product: the Brilliantine ($36), a polish that makes the hard-to-style slept-in look a breeze to achieve. For the gal on the move, grab a bottle of the Hair Power ($63/$34) -- in shades of white, blonde, brown and black -- the powder formula makes a spruce-up-on-the-go totally doable. And ahead of the year-end holiday, don&#146;t leave without grabbing a bottle of the Surf Spray ($39). A salt-infused styling product that mimics what the ocean does to your follicles, the spray adds au naturel lift and body to your silky locks.]]></description>

We say real men ought to wear the brand new Hot Water ($59-$112) instead: it&#146;s got red basil, absinthe, wormwood, pimento and benzoic siam for a fresh, spicy and sensual finish. It even looks more macho with the bottle&#146;s harder lines, sharper edges and deep red hue.

				<description><![CDATA[20 Oct 2009-30 Nov1999 - Corporate team-building exercises can make you want to kill yourself. Luckily the folks in <em>Severance</em> were spared the effort. A group of British cube dwellers on a bonding mission travel to a lodge in a Hungarian forest, where they are attacked by a mysterious killer. As bodies begin to drop faster than share prices at Lehman Brothers, the survivors must use all their water-cooler savvy to stay alive. Filled with gore, <em>Severance</em> recalls the glory days of the Saw and Hostel, yet manages to shoot sharp satirical arrows in the direction of contemporary office culture. There&#146;s an absence of A-list stars but the movie does not suffer for it. You would be hard pressed to find another film that marries comedy and horror so successfully.

				<description><![CDATA[09 Oct 2009-30 Nov1999 - Cast as Stu Shephard, Colin Farrell plays a sleazy media consultant whose life is thrown into a maelstrom when he picks up a ringing public telephone. The caller on the other end turns out to be a friendly neighbourhood sniper who promises Stu that his head will be blown off if he hangs up. The plot thickens when the area near the booth becomes the scene of another crime and the coppers show up. Seeing Stu standing inside the booth, they assume he is the perpetrator, and Stu is forced to confront all his lies in order to escape the ordeal. This is a thrilling ride with many layers, revealed gradually through brilliant acting from Forest Whitaker (Captain Ramey &#150; the senior police officer on the scene) and Kiefer Sutherland (the sniper).

				<description><![CDATA[11 Oct 2009-30 Nov1999 - Director Judd Apatow &#150; he of<em> The 40-Year- Old Virgin</em> and <em>Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy</em> fame is back to his best with <em>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</em>. While the previous two movies showcased established comedic talents (Steve Carell and the hilariously batty Will Ferrell), this one features relative newcomer Jason Segel (Marshall on <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>) in the lead. Segel is not in the same class as the other two, but Apatow manages to make the film an unqualified success. The plot revolves around Peter Bretter (Segel) who, when dumped by his girlfriend Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), goes on a downward spiral, alternating depressive interludes with random one-night stands. Peter takes a Hawaiian holiday to exorcise her ghost, but surprise surprise &#150; Sarah ends up there with her latest beau, British singer Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). Peter befriends a hotel employee (Paul Rudd) and a surf instructor with a passion for buying drugs, as well as Matthew (Jonah Hill), a restaurant worker with a passion for selling them. Aided by these friends, Segel finally begins to move on. With trademark performances from Rudd and Hill, the film retains Apatow&#146;s trademark humour while imbuing it with a certain romantic all-over sweetness.

				<description><![CDATA[13 Oct 2009-30 Nov1999 - Ten years after raising hell in the original Clerks, Dante Hicks (Brian O&#146;Halloran) and Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) are back to give viewers a second helping of director Kevin Smith&#146;s raucous humour. The store assistants have moved on to working at Mooby&#146;s, a fast-food restaurant, unleashing their wacky antics on unwitting customers. Add in a class-A nerd (Trevor Ferhman) and a smoking-hot, ineffective manager (Rosario Dawson), and Dante and Randal have free rein to turn the place on its head. When not harassing customers, the crazy pair debate topics such as the moral conundrum over the Death Star in Return of the Jedi, and who would win in a fight between George Lucas, Peter Jackson and Jesus (the answer, of course, is no one &#150; Chuck Norris would kick everyone&#146;s butts). Changes are afoot in crazy-world, though, and when Dante plans to leave town and get married, it&#146;s the cue for Randal to start planning a going-away party that would make a Roman king proud. If you are a sucker for outrageous humour, it does not get better than this. Except if you watch the first Clerks, of course.

				<description><![CDATA[18 Oct 2009-30 Nov1999 - George Orwell&#146;s cautionary tale about Big Brother becomes more prescient with every CCTV camera that goes up. Under Surveillance takes a look at how these devices, as well as our everyday toys (computers and mobile phones), are becoming increasingly intrusive, used to monitor people&#146;s activities in public as well as private places. Uncomfortable questions are raised about whether personal privacy even exists any more, or whether it is a fanciful notion that belongs in the past.

				<description><![CDATA[25 Oct 2009-30 Nov1999 - Before metal, there was wood, and this is what sailors used to traverse (rather unsuccessfully) the raging seas in the 9th century. In 1998, a shipwreck from that era was found laden with gold, silver and ceramic items that are now kept in a highsecurity storage in Singapore. Travel in high definition to the place where the wreck was found, and see how the items found onboard are used to piece together a vivid picture of Tang-dynasty China. The programme will also re-create the last few days of the ship&#146;s journey before it finally met its watery grave in the Straits of Indonesia.

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - <a href="http://www.giveart.net">Give Art</a>, a newly launched gallery in Chinatown, is taking the snobbery out of original artwork by making authentic works affordable &#150; well, to an extent. The artwork still maintains its lofty status with originals that cost anywhere from $500 to $3,500, but Give Art&#146;s clever twist is that it&#146;s launching its gallery into cyberspace with a social networking-like agenda. In so doing, anyone who longs for that perfect <em>pi&#232;ce de r&#233;sistance</em> can alert friends via the handy internet, at which point these worldly friends can choose to band together to pitch a fraction of the total amount to buy or make that one-of-a-kind art piece more affordable.

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - Now you can give your art-loving friend an original piece without breaking the bank. <a href="http://www.giveart.net">Give Art</a>, launched at the end of July, is a bespoke online gift-list service that allows family and friends to chip in for a piece of art. Here&#146;s how it works: a gift list for the desired artwork is created, along with a personal, interactive profile page. Photographs are then uploaded and contributors can post comments and messages on the page. All these good wishes and the biography of the artist will eventually make up the pages of an exquisite hardcover &#145;guest book&#146;, which comes bundled with the artwork. Choose from paintings, photography and monoprints by artists including Jason Wee, Justin Lee, Frances Alleblas, Guy Duke, Santi Lawrachawee and Tamae Iwasaki. And if you can&#146;t find anything that tugs at your heartstrings, Give Art can also arrange for commissioned pieces, or help you track down the piece you have in mind.
&#160;
<em><strong>Costs: </strong>From $350-$4,000 (unframed) </em>

				<description><![CDATA[06 Jul 2009-30 Nov1999 - The contemporary retelling of this classic tale has it all &#150; banter, swordfights, fair maidens and, of course, men in leotards. In the second season the Sheriff of Nottingham, much like Wile E Coyote, is making yet another destined-to-fail plan to kill the rascally Robin &#150; medieval England&#146;s mythical equivalent to the Road Runner. Seeking to polish his professional assassin CV, the Sheriff is also involved in hatching a plot to kill King Richard on his return from the Crusades. Maid Marian is in there somewhere as well, looking pretty. Settle down for some good-old fashioned intrigue, action and wit.

&#160;
The Incas of Peru were far more than skirt-wearing men riding oversized llamas, and so were the Aztecs of Mexico. Both these societies built formidable empires that dominated the pre-Columbus Americas. This three-part series charts the decline and fall of the Incas and Aztecs at the hands of the conquistadors &#150; the soldiers and explorers of the Spanish empire. These men were consummate, battle-hardened warriors who played a major part in bringing two of the most advanced civilisations of the age down to their knees. A must-watch for history buffs everywhere.

Pete Sampras came, saw and conquered Wimbledon an astonishing seven times in one decade, smashing aces past weeping peers. And a decade before Sampras emerged, Jimmy Connors was delighting crowds with his deft volleys and volatile outbursts.

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - An annual component of the Festival is Out of Focus, an exhibition aimed at presenting new photography talent in Singapore. Each year, the Festival exhibits emerging Singapore-based photographers. Out of Focus 2009 presents the works of three emerging Singaporean photographers: Jean Loo, Muhammad Nuruddin Bin Ahman Fuad (Dyn), Then Chih Wey. Each of the three photographers explored Asia in their own way. In Jean Loos series, &#34;Saved by Buddha, she documents the ethnic minority children in Myanmar who have been handicapped by their country's internal strife and who find a safe haven in monasteries and the opportunity to receive an education. Dyn has chosen to engage literally in his own backyard an open field near where he lives and spent many nights photographing the environment. This series of long night exposures questions the permanence of space and reality versus fiction, challenging the viewer to reconsider his/her environment. Then Chih Wey decided to step away from the daily grind to embark on what became an 8-month trip across South and Central Asia. His thoughtful yet visually poetic images give us an insight into Bangladesh, Xinjiang, Kazakhstan and Iran.

				<description><![CDATA[01 May 2009-30 Nov1999 - <em><strong>Dolphins and Whales 3D: Tribes of the Ocean </strong></em>
&#160;
At first glance, dolphins and whales seem like an unlikely choice for the 3D treatment, since the ocean doesn&#146;t offer a lot of the necessary depth cues &#150; you&#146;ve got the swimmers against a characterless background of water. But the first time a camera cruises down the side of a whale, that objection falls away. The narration (read by Daryl Hannah, sounding oddly like Laurie Anderson sans irony) falls into a repetitive structure for each species (they&#146;re beautiful, they&#146;re endangered, repeat), but as educational conservation films go, it&#146;s pretty effective (Hank Sartin).

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - If battery-operated devices are essential to your life (we mean your toothbrush!) add one more to the list: Neutrogena&#146;s Wave Power Cleanser ($24.90). It&#146;s a facial cleanser that comes in the form of a cute bright-pink gadget designed to fit ergonomically into the palm of your hand (and not anywhere else&#133;) Attach the disposable foaming pad to the head of the power cleanser, hold it under running water to activate the cleansing pad, then switch it on and gently massage over your face, avoiding the eye area. The tingly cool foam penetrates deep into your pores while the gentle vibrating motion (remember, this is for your face!) stimulates the skin&#146;s surface to remove dirt, oil and make-up &#150; supposedly up to ten times deeper than traditional cleansers. The starter kit includes the power cleanser applicator, a two-week supply of predosed, single-use pads and one AA battery. Refills are priced at $13.20 for a 30- day supply.
&#160;

				<description><![CDATA[14 May 2009-30 Nov1999 - Aside from playing p&#233;tanque and perpetually smoking, the French are known for their haute cuisine.

Will the duo fulfil its quest for monster lobsters and moose? Food lovers are advised to wear a bib while watching this programme as it may cause copious amounts of drooling.

				<description><![CDATA[05 May 2009-30 Nov1999 - The French crime thriller has long had a love-hate relationship with its more (commercially) powerful American counterpart &#150; from Hollywood&#146;s embrace of the fatale atmospherics of &#146;30s French poetic realism to Melville&#146;s complimentary refinements of the cruder energies of postwar US film noir. Olivier Marchal&#146;s hard-nosed 36&#133; is an unsentimental, slightly OTT portrait of the ruthlessly competitive police hierarchies stationed at the Quai des Orf&#232;vres (Wally Hammond).

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - One of the most famous war movies of all time,<em> The Great Escape</em> is the true story of a group of American, British and Australian World War II prisoners who attempted to break out from a German prison camp in 1944. The Germans rounded up this crack squad and put them together in a prison from which there could be no escape. Or so they thought. Led by the cunning Roger &#145;Big X&#146; Bartlett (Richard Attenborough) along with the incorrigible Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen), the 600-odd prisoners dig a series of tunnels with each person assigned work based on his expertise. Directed by John Sturges, the classic story has a brilliant mix of machismo and humour. Bolstered by the presence of a blockbuster cast (Charles Bronson plays Danny Velinski &#145;The Tunnel King&#146;), <em>The Great Escape</em> has attained legendary status since its release in 1963 and is definitely a must-add to any serious movie aficionado&#146;s have-seen collection.

				<description><![CDATA[05 Mar 2009-30 Nov1999 - KITT is back and Hasselhoff is not, giving fans two reasons to celebrate. The car that first captured the imagination as a crime-fighting machine in the &#146;80s now has the ability to hack into any computer system, can change its shape and colour, and is equipped with artificial intelligence. Val Kilmer provides KITT with his/her/its voice. <em>Knight Rider </em>redux promises to be faster, louder and more sinister. Fingers crossed that Justin Bruening, who fronts the new series, can act better than a speaking car &#150; unlike his predecessor.

				<description><![CDATA[02 Mar 2009-30 Nov1999 - What happens if a moron starts hosting a popular radio show? The ratings go up, that&#146;s what. Lance (Lance Krall) an intern with an IQ of about 7, finds himself in the hot seat after the show&#146;s host quits. Trying to ask probing questions of the celebrities who appear on the show, our man comes up with classics like &#145;Will Spider-Man be joining the cast of <em>Heroes</em>?&#146; (to Jack Coleman, who plays Noah Bennet in <em>Heroes</em>) and &#145;Isn&#146;t it time Ray Romano played a serial killer?&#146; (to Romano, who played Raymond Barone in <em>Everybody Loves Raymond</em>). With each dim-witted question, the show becomes more popular, catapulting Lance to fame. If such buffoonery is what gets you snorting with laughter, tune in to this promising new series.

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - If intricate cultural architecture ranks high on your priority list when selecting a hotel, book a room at the new Four Seasons Hotel Macau, Cotai Strip the next time you&#146;re in the Las Vegas of Asia. Inspired by the ancient Portuguese history of the area and the predominant Chinese culture in the enclave, the hotel is conceptualised by renowned interior design firm HBA/Hirsch Bedner Associates. Think European style grandeur blended with oriental accents. Oversized, Portuguese-style custom-made lanterns, original 18th century Chinese lacquer screens and a cosy fireplace all help to create a stunning lobby. Meanwhile, guestrooms feature Ming Dynasty style consoles, and textiles and etchings of the city streets akin to those found in the ancient markets of Macau.

				<description><![CDATA[23 Feb 2009-30 Nov1999 - <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em> is about a cable guy, Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), who sees a UFO flying through the night sky and is subsequently haunted by the image of a mountain in his dreams. He becomes obsessed with finding the mountain where aliens will finally make contact with humans. Other than its gripping story and masterful acting, particularly by Dreyfuss, <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em> was notable for its likeable depiction of aliens &#150; unlike similar movies made before this and most of the ones made after. With his customary attention to detail, grandiose sets and state-of-the-art special effects (for the &#146;70s), Spielberg created an epic that embedded itself into mainstream culture.

				<description><![CDATA[08 Feb 2009-30 Nov1999 - When Dolly the sheep baa&#146;ed for the first time, the throaty sound reverberated throughout the world. Man could now grant life, as well as take it. Ever since that day, scientists have been trying to perfect the techniques to clone humans. This programme looks at the progress made by one such group of scientists as it tries to overcome not only the technical challenges but also the opposition of governments and the international community who believe it would be ethically wrong to artificially create life. Cloning of humans promises to be either the zenith or the nadir of human achievement, which is part of what makes the idea so riveting.

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - Love your lashes? Then head down to Hollywood fave Talika&#146;s first counter at BHG Bugis. These experts in eye and eyelash care from Paris boast more than 20 products made of natural ingredients, all tested &#150; with results proven &#150; by a team of dermatologists at the French capital city&#146;s Salp&#234;tri&#232;re Hospital. Standout products include the Lipocils Eyelash Treatment Gel 10ml ($68), formulated with natural plant extracts and proven to stimulate eyelash growth in just 28 days. Another is the Eye Detox Contour Gel 1.8ml ($75); while we&#146;re sceptical about the guarantee of an 85 per cent reduction in dark circles and 92 per cent reduction of puffy eye bags, we&#146;re open to giving it a go. <br />

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - This travel resource website from Hong Kong gets our approval. It was launched more than a year ago by Richard Archer-Perkins, 54, after having spent a lot of &#145;dead&#146; time (when you usually just stare into space) in airport lounges. His aim? To keep you itinerant and in tune with the globe you trot &#150; the user-generated information-sharing and networking platform for travellers is perhaps one of the most well-integrated online travel communities on the &#146;net. It also boasts the latest travel news, flight information and offers a space where users can share photos and itineraries.

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - Sick of the usual holiday formula of beach, sun and cocktails? Why not go for a four-mile (6.43km) run instead? Don&#146;t worry &#150; you can still consider this a holiday, since this isn&#146;t the East Coast you&#146;re plodding down, but Hollywood. The tour starts off at flashy Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, cuts through West Hollywood and past the boutiques on Robertson Boulevard. If you&#146;re lucky, you may even spot the odd celeb window-shopping or dodging the ever-intent paparazzi. The cost? US$60 (S$88). Not bad when it includes a T-shirt, bottled water and fresh fruit, and ends with a sweeterthan- sweet touch &#150; a frosted cupcake. <br />

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - A funky hotel room for S$3? Sinclair Beecham was no fool when he decided to embark on his first hotel venture. The owner of the famous sandwich chain Pret a Manger was so appalled at being charged S$7.50 for a Mars bar in a hotel, he did what most of us can only dream of &#150; he opened The Hoxton, his own budget-conscious design hotel. Located in (yes, you&#146;ve guessed it) Hoxton EC2, London&#146;s super-cool postcode of the moment, the rooms come with Aveda products, flat-screen TVs, free Wi-Fi and a &#145;Lite Pret Breakfast&#146; of banana, yoghurt, orange juice, a litre of milk and water. Room rates range from &#163;59 (S$148) to &#163;235 (S$591), but the golden ticket lies in the S$3 rooms known only to those who register on their website. How does it work? They sell five rooms at S$3 every night, and another five at S$90. Very cool indeed, especially considering the price of milk these days. <br />

Known to recommend only the coolest, design-savvy hotspots, the website displays many a drool-worthy hotel &#150; including Britney Spears&#146; favourite, Parrot Cay in the Turks and Caicos Islands.

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - Imagine walking off chronic knee pain and backache. Or slipping into a pair of sandals that help to tone the bottom and thighs, giving them a workout equivalent to hitting the gym. Engineered with a multi-density mid-sole, the FitFlop from the UK incorporates the patent-pending &#145;microwobbleboard&#146; (try saying that thrice for fun) technology, which they claim challenges hard-to-reach muscles to work harder while reducing joint strain and absorbing shock. And after giving it a go &#150; specifically a few tours around VivoCity &#150; we can definitely feel some sort of a lower-body workout happening. If you&#146;re the sort who needs a bit more convincing, how&#146;s this for proof: since the launch last year, the shoe has generated almost US$120 (S$171) million in sales, has a waiting list on leading luxuryfashion retailer Net-a-Porter.com, and has been namechecked by the divine Miss O (that&#146;s Oprah). <br />

Treat Beauty (from $21.50) is a range of body scrubs, creams and bath products made with &#145;wildcrafted&#146; ingredients that promise to nourish and heal your body. Research has shown that because such components are gathered from their natural habitat, they have twice the nutritional, healing, medicinal and therapeutic properties of even organic ingredients. Added to that, the products are paraben- and sulfatefree and Treat Beauty does not use or condone animal testing, so you can indulge with a clean conscience. <br />

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - From computer to clavicle, Nervous System is the experimental jewellery brainchild of New York-based MIT grad team, Jessica Rosenkrantz and Jesse Louis-Rosenberg. Who knew you could wear algorithms? The duo combines computer applications with prototyping technology to create template designs inspired by complex structures found in our natural habitat. By applying water jets to cut through silicone rubber and stainless steel, they&#146;ve produced intricate, skeletal structures similar to coral aggregation and amoebas. These are showcased in their Dendrite and Radiolaria (pictured) lines. Keep an eye on their website (and the name); Nervous System may make the transition from small trinkets and jewellery to larger architectural pieces in the near future. <br />

A splendidly maintained green space not far from the city centre, the Gardens have a sizeable fanbase among joggers, picnickers and casual visitors. Highlights include the National Orchid Garden, with the world&#146;s largest collection of orchids &#150; some 1,000 species and 2,000 hybrids, including the national flower, Vanda Miss Joaquim. There is also a swan lake where visitors can feed the black Australian swans, a large population of turtles, and the Evolution Garden Walk, a well-landscaped plot containing the fossilised remains of ancient trees. During weekends, tours to its rainforest patch are available, while outdoor concerts are often held at Symphony Lake.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - Can SK-II&#146;s Aqua Physics Gel range, enriched with Aqua D-up complex, deliver constant levels of hydration? I had to try this out for myself, so over the course of a week, I started my morning routine by pumping out and putting on a 20-cent-coin size of the Aqua Physic Serum ($99), followed by spreading a 3cm-long amount of the Aqua Physics Gel ($99) all over my face. By the week&#146;s end, I noticed that my T-zone had mattified and my face had a velvety soft texture. Surprisingly, despite my irregular sleep hours, my face still radiated a subtle sheen. My only complaint was the gel left behind a semi-sticky film, which probably helped my make-up hold better, but was something I would certainly take some getting used to.&#160;&#160;<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - Baby Foot Trust the efficient Japanese to come up with a way to take foot exfoliation on-the-go. The Baby Foot kit ($59.90) is a threepiece kit that comes with a pair of toe socks, slip-on rubber booties and a 100ml treatment solution. Just slip on the socks and the rubber booties, and then pour in half the bottle of treatment solution in each bootie. After two hours, remove the footwear, rinse and apply your own foot moisturiser as per normal. If their promise holds true, within the next five to seven days, the skin on your feet will start to peel and (hopefully) reveal soft feet that will rival those of any newborn.&#160;<br />

Just look at the fall/winter &#146;07 collections of alldressedup and Pocket Venus (pictured), two in-store labels found at The Link. The former&#146;s collection illustrates the best of both worlds with details like intricate Indian saristyle embroidery, razor-sharp pleats reminiscent of Chinese lantern shapes, and Spanish flair with bolero jackets, voluminous hems and dramatic ruching. The latter &#150; designed by Jane Troughton and favoured by the likes of Jodie Kidd and Rosamund Pike &#150; have graphic prints used on kimono sleeves and a modernist box-cut jacket jazzed up with Japanese beading and sharp pleats.&#160;<br />

Using Tandome tanning booths, the German-made machines are equipped with a suction device that sucks out the hot air to give patrons a cool tanning experience.

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - You&#146;ve heard of the rumoured ten-step skincare routine practised by Japanese women; local outfit Simply Spa tops that and introduces a 15-step facial. Using Perfect Potion&#146;s organic, plant-made aromatherapy Replenish, the Replenish Facial ($138 for 90 mins) starts with a ten-minute finger-press aromatic massage where essential oils are selected to suit customers&#146; needs. Next comes the cleansing, followed by exfoliation using a fresh milk mask with natural dairy particles. Instead of using water to remove the exfoliating particles, aroma-infused essential oil water is used so the skin is kept moisturised. A purifying mask and exfoliation treatment continues, followed by an oiled water rinse, extraction process and face massage, then a moisturising mask. The last steps consist of applications of a carrot-based serum, day cream and lip balm. Exclusive to Simply Spa, this facial treatment is pure bliss.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - One central theme, three different interpretations. That&#146;s the idea behind t43 Jewellery, the brainchild of a trio of Central Saint Martins studentsturned- jewellery-designers. Their newest collection, &#145;Art-Tea-Scent&#146;, was launched at the recent Singapore Fashion Week and saw three unique collections. Inspired by origami and calligraphy, Taiwanese designer Szu Fen&#146;s (Art) bold statement pieces have auspicious names of Chinese teas burnt into the fabric of neckpieces, bangles and rings. Japanese-born Nana (Tea) produced a wearable collection of graphic-engraved sterling silver pieces &#150; pendants and earrings &#150; with wood and acrylic accents, cutely packaged in the form of a teabag. Meanwhile, local talent Serene&#146;s (Scent) collection, inspired by the aroma of her favourite teas, took the form of whimsical acrylic and silver pieces (pictured at left). Produced in limited quantities, each piece is hand fabricated and priced from $200 upwards.&#160;<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - Move over flip-flops, the spanking-new
eco-friendly sandals, Dopie, are about to
cause quite a flurry in Singapore. Made
of recycled EVA and foam rubber, Dopie
positions itself as minimalist footwear
– so minimal, in fact, it feels as if you’re not
wearing any shoes at all. The result of a
collaboration between industrial designer
Matthew Harrison and eco-friendly
shoe company Terra Plana, they’ve been
increasingly worn by those in the know
since launching in April this year. Available at Spin the Bottle,
#01-02 The Cathay. Dhoby Ghaut.
Sun-Thu 12.30-10.30pm; Fri &amp; Sat

				<description><![CDATA[Tue 30 Nov1999 - To achieve a taut six-pack like MediaCorp
artiste Ix Shen, all you need are the Power
Plate machines at Verve Studio. Co-owned
by Shen – who does double duty as master
trainer – the idea behind this workout is
that the vibrations cause muscles to contract
naturally and thus force your body
into ‘working out’. Just 40 minutes on the
machine is approximately equivalent
to two hours of weight training at the
gym… it’s a lazy person’s fitness regime
and a poor man’s indulgence.]]></description>
