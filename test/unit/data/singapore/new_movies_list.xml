				<description><![CDATA[A James Bond/&#145;Mission: Impossible&#146; pastiche mixing live action with talking CG animals, this 3D sequel to 2001&#146;s witless farrago is such an irredeemable failure that, judging by the silent reaction of every child at the screening, I would guess they would rather have been at home doing trigonometry. <br />
<br />
No improbable stone is left unturned as the convoluted &#146;60s-style spy caper unfolds to present a tale of conflict between two of mankind&#146;s most popular pets. On one side we have the secret, ultra-hi-tech organisation, Dogs HQ, and on the other, the terrifying spectre of a bald pussy with plans to take over the world. <br />
<br />
You do wonder how this odious enterprise ever got the green light: the script suggests it was developed on the hoof; the CGI is low grade stuff; and the human performances are loathsome. Worst of all, it&#146;s not even funny. Very paw.<em> Derek Adams</em>]]></description>

				<title>Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps</title>

				<description><![CDATA[Oliver Stone is back on the trading floor and Michael Douglas is back in the sharp suits in this undisciplined attempt by the director of 'JFK' and 'W' at resurrecting his totemic &#146;80s fable, combining melodrama with up-to-the-minute social and economic commentary. The characterisations are so broad and the plotting so wild that this revival is best viewed as a camp comedy and a knowing in-joke &#150; albeit one that feels the need to plant economics lectures in the mouths of its cast so that it at least sounds like a serious attempt to take the pulse of our times.<br />
<br />
Jacob (Shia LaBeouf) is a mindful and smart young trader at a Wall Street bank, where he enjoys the support and mentorship of a banking boss of the old school (Frank Langella) and is on the verge of ploughing money into an eco-business he&#146;s identified as a safe, responsible investment. <br />
<br />
But the good vibes can&#146;t last. There&#146;s a crash and an aggressive takeover by rival banking boss Bretton James (Josh Brolin, all cigars and motorbikes) sends his mentor tumbling onto the subway tracks, and Jacob into Bretton&#146;s more mercenary hands. The other hitch is that Jacob&#146;s &#145;leftie&#146; girlfriend is Winnie Gekko (Carey Mulligan), estranged daughter of Gordon (Michael Douglas), who&#146;s on his way out of jail and not necessarily the reformed character he might appear.<br />
<br />
Stone&#146;s lightweight and soapy film feels like he threw a whole load of newspaper clippings at a tired plot about estranged fathers and a clash of values. The problem with this film is that if you put it in front of a bunch of bankers, they&#146;d laugh their heads off and feel a swell of pride at the thought that they inhabit a world as glamorous as that suggested by Stone&#146;s indulging of the New York skyline and the trappings of excessive wealth. It&#146;s hardly satire. This is a pulp novelisation of the banking crisis and its pleas for relevance ring very hollow. <em>Dave Calhoun</em>]]></description>
