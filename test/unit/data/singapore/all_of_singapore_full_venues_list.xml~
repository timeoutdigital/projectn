				<description><![CDATA[Since late October, Pepes has been warming the spot previously occupied by Sanur Indonesian Restaurant. You might have heard that the man behind Pepes is Tom Hau, one of the brothers who co-owned Sanur. If this sounds suspiciously like the aftermath of a family feud, don&#146;t bother coaxing the staff into airing the Hau&#146;s dirty laundry, as our attempt only succeeded in drawing a blank look. <br />
<br />
Feud or not, it is business as usual at the brightly lit Pepes. With the peek-a-boo glass walls, tables dressed with ikat (an Indonesian weaving) and rough-cut grey concrete walls, this is one trendy warung. The menu, while short &#150; 24 items to be exact &#150; is fi lled with familiar favourites: fork-tender beef rendang swamped in a dense coconut mush to melt-in-the-mouth eggplant saut&#233;ed with a wicked, sambal-laced chilli paste. <br />
<br />
A must-have at Pepes is ayam pop, chicken simmered in a complex brew of ginger, garlic and chilli powder, then crowned with cut chillis and chopped onions. The chicken was juicy and imbued with the profound fl avours of the spices. Kepala ikan, fi sh head bathed in a piquant yet sweet-and-tangy, assam-based broth, is another very enjoyable dish for those who prefer a coconut milk-free alternative to fi sh head curry.<br />
<br />
But the twist is that Pepes strives for a healthy kitchen. The use of MSG is avoided whenever possible, an alternative is used in place of palm oil and the cooks also make an effort to drain off excess oil. Nice touches, but is taste sacrifi ced at the expense of health? Decadent tahur teloh arrived nicely fluffed up and drizzled with kecap manis (a syrupy soy sauce) but strangely, tasted fl at. Lush kangkong tossed in piquant sambal arrived a tad watery, though the sambal-imparted pungency helped make up for this. <br />
<br />
Pepes&#146; mall location means that business can be hectic. The waitstaff are generally effi cient but the restaurant manager can occasionally come across as brusque. On one visit, she took issue with our table for poring over the menu, curtly asking us to return it. That&#146;ll be a refund on the 10 per cent service charge, please! <em>Eve C&#160; </em>]]></description>

				<title>The Nautilus Project</title>
				<link>http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/xmlapi/xml_detail/?venue=2151&amp;key=ffab6a24c60f562ecf705130a36c1d1e</link>
				<guid>http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/xmlapi/xml_detail/?venue=2151&amp;key=ffab6a24c60f562ecf705130a36c1d1e</guid>
				<description><![CDATA[The Nautilus Project has thrown down anchor on the top fl oor of the behemoth ION Orchard. Coming from the same team responsible for the well-regarded Prime Society in Dempsey Hill, I had high hopes for a great meal at this new seafood restaurant. However, after dining twice at TNP, I&#146;m not sure if &#145;restaurant&#146; is even the word I would use to describe this place. A polished cafeteria is probably more apt &#150; which is a shame, as the food is superior to the souped-up slop you&#146;ll fi nd dished out in similar settings. <br />
<br />
A perfect example of this prioritising of style over substance is its choice of crockery. For my starter, I ordered the signature lobster trilogy. The trio of a chilled lobster salad, a caramelised lobster custard and a warm lobster souffl &#233; is served in an impractical rectangular platter with three tiny bowls and impossible to eat with the knife and fork they provide. I looked like the Giant from Jack and the Beanstalk attempting to eat a meal out of Jack&#146;s tiny bowl with a shovel. Using the cutlery resulted in the souffl &#233; oozing all over the platter, followed quickly by the p&#226;t&#233;-like custard (which incidentally would have been much tastier with some crackers). Before tackling my poor lobster salad, a waiter hurriedly ran over with a tiny teaspoon. However, with half my fl avourful $29 starter lying wasted on my platter, I felt defeated. A good rule of thumb: the more straightforward the dish, the more successful it&#146;s likely to be. <br />
<br />
On a second visit, I ordered another of TNP&#146;s signature dishes, a Nautilus soup kettle. Step one: choose your seafood. Step two: choose your stock. Opting for mussels, clams, reef fi sh, crab and pipis in a spicy Thai coconut stock, I expected a fragrant, rich dish. I wasn&#146;t wrong. However, the meal came served in a bowl on an unnecessarily large tray, with the crabs and mussels still in their shell. I don&#146;t mind the crack-it-open-yourself style of dining, but the setting was all wrong. Firstly, where was I meant to be discarding my shells? Waiter! Where was my soup spoon? Waiter! Where were my fi nger bowl and extra napkins? You catch my drift. By the end of the meal, I was thankful not to be on a fi rst date &#150; things got messy. <br />
<br />
Testing the quality of seafood is always better without much fanfare. As long as it&#146;s fresh, there&#146;s not much that needs to be done. A little lemon here and a pinch of salt there should provide all of the seasoning needed. Save for the lusciously giant oysters &#150; served fresh in their shells and ready to be slurped up upon arrival &#150; TNP has decided that the more tricked-up the meal the better, creative twists and wacky plating taking precedence over practicality. <br />
<br />
A starter of salt and pepper squid came paired with an Asian-inspired &#146;slaw (which confusingly contained pine nuts) and a small bowl of spicy peanut dressing. It was not lacking in the looks department, but together the tastes clashed. The tempura-battered fish and chips were bland, as was the herb-crusted yellowfi n tuna with green beans. Thankfully, the roasted grouper fi llet in a kaffi r lime and coconut sauce with a side of garam masala potatoes came as a pleasant surprise. The dish was perfectly restrained and delivered complex fl avours to enhance the protein&#146;s robust fi shy taste. I am left stumped by this place. The food has real potential, but would I come back? Probably not. It&#146;s a little caught between two worlds. After two visits I wasn&#146;t hooked, so maybe it would be better for this spot to get back to the basics. <em>Mary Weaver<br />

				<description><![CDATA[<strong>Eat this: </strong>The crunchy and tender <em>puu nim phriktal dum</em>. Black pepper soft-shell crab with kaffir lime leaves and garlic.
<strong>Take a pass: </strong>The usually complex but delicate Thai stalwarts &#150; <em>yum talay </em>(seafood salad), tom yum kung and <em>gang paa kung sub </em>(eastern woodland-style red curry) &#150; were fresh, but doused so heavily in chillis that they were hard to stomach.
<strong>Tip: </strong>Avoid entering through the fifth floor entrance; the fourth floor is much more welcoming.
<strong>Fun fact: </strong>The translation of the name Soht &#38; Baay doubles up as its motto: &#145;Fresh &#38; Good&#146;.

				<description><![CDATA[The Indian-Chinese dishes that are heating up the kitchen across the street from Mustafa Centre are not part of some new trend. The fusion of cuisines dates back centuries to the first Chinese migrations to India, when a new land&#146;s seductive spices were applied to the traditional cooking of the old. The relocation is displayed over Indian Wok&#146;s 15-page menu and, when served, the gastronomic results exceeded my expectations with flying colours and fiery flavours.
The interior is not shabby by any means, but the red-carpeted stairs leading up to the restaurant will have you wondering if you&#146;ve made a wrong turn and into a shady massage parlour. But the door opens to a surprisingly attractive establishment, and gracious waiters offer a warm welcome. Exactly what kind of look they are going for is hard to pin down, though; it seems as though the designers were trying too hard with the painted gold ceiling, white tablecloths and embossed wallpaper.
My attention quickly turned from the embellished decor to spicy pickles (placed on the table upon arrival) and a long list of dishes that were crying out for my tasting. A mountain of crunchy deep-fried spinach was the first appetiser to arrive. The Sichuan chilli sauce that decorated the darkgreen cubes &#150; comparable to croutons &#150; got my mouth tingling. The spring rolls were leaning a bit more towards the Chinese border, and helped cleanse the palate with a subtle ginger flavour and a little less heat.
<br />
<em>Deviled Prawns</em>
If the mains were more hit and miss, at least each dish was executed with an element of surprise. Described on the menu as &#145;a wonderful Indian creation&#146;, there was little information as to what should be expected with The Vegetable Manchurian. This dish is made from a batter that&#146;s flavoured with red chilli oil, Sichuan pepper, minced garlic and green onions, and moulded into great balls of fire. Eager to try new dishes upon my second visit, this was one I just had to order again. The panfried noodles with cabbage, mushrooms and carrot lost their appeal when shortly after arriving, the once-crispy noodles became soggy and resembled something that came out of a can.
Leaving the border-crossing flavours aside, the sizzling brownie had to be tasted. Someone had already been feasting on the chocolate goodness when we arrived, so it was imperative for us to try this dish. Served on a hotplate, the waiter pours the molten chocolate sauce right in front of your eyes and a scoop of vanilla ice cream made a perfect accompaniment. The burning desire to unbuckle my jeans soon after devouring this sweet piece of heaven didn&#146;t bother me; it was <em>that </em>good.
The portions are generous and the staff courteous. Read: you&#146;ll be thankful that your water glass is constantly being refilled and that the air-conditioning is going strong when these dishes have you perspiring and your mouth burning. Even after wolfing down the chilli-smothered devil prawns, shredded chicken with soy garlic sauce and braised beancurd with black mushrooms, it felt as though I had only scratched this wok&#146;s surface.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The folks behind Island Creamery have officially ventured beyond their creamy turf with the inception of this chic-rustic, corrugated tin- and woodframed burger bistro. What sets this new kid on the block apart from its burger brethren is its undivided attention to selling home-style burgers at affordable prices &#150; $5.70 gets you a classic burger with a plump hunk of juicy flame-grilled New Zealand beef patty swaddled in toasted buns. Veggie options are offered as well &#150; try the pan-fried, breaded Portobello mushrooms. Rice lovers need not despair; you are welcome to swap the burger buns for the utterly fragrant and fluffy butter garlic rice at no additional cost. Top up $3.20 and they&#146;ll throw in your choice of canned beverage and lip-smacking, spice-dusted French fries.]]></description>

The doughy Cubano lacks heart, and the bread and butter pudding is too eggy for comfort. Fortunately the chunky pineapple caipirinha can act as a refreshing birdbath.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[It takes a special kind of bravado to successfully decorate a restaurant like Myra&#146;s Beach Club. As you prop your sandy self up at their spacious bar and survey Myra&#146;s interior, the odd mix of the small live-music stage decorated with a bullfighting poster, surfboard adorned with flashing fairy lights and zombie-shooting arcade game will have you wondering what misguided delights await you on their menu. Somehow, the eclectic decor works well and the food does not disappoint. The quesadillas are moist without being greasy, and livened up with mixed cheese, jalape&#241;os and fresh cilantro. The burritos offer a more hearty feed, though the beef variety tastes a little low-grade in quality. Mexican natives may get a little hot under the poncho with the absence of guacamole as a side, but on the whole, Myra&#146;s whips up an impressively authentic menu.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[If you&#146;d describe yourself as having champagne taste on a beer-bottle budget, then this tiny drinking hole is the place for you. In keeping with this city&#146;s growing trend for bottle shops, here you&#146;ll find sheltered outdoor timber seating for up to 24, delightful if somewhat slow service, glasses of red and white for $8 and bottles for well under $30. But the hands-down, uncontested, very best deal to be had here is a 200ml bottle of sparkling wine for $8.80 &#150; or $5.28 on special. And the icing on the cake? Denise will let you order fries or a burger from Bergs, so you can line that tummy and continue to quaff the night away.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The fourth outlet of this Pokka Food chain is loftier, in ways more than just appearance: over-reaching glass windows and an extended menu have established it as a regular haunt of the area&#146;s upwardly mobile. The seasonal, sometimes sustainable, Sashimi-Mori is a well-carved platter of ingredients flown in twice weekly from Tokyo&#146;s Tsukiji market. This is balanced well with the layered katsu &#150; three razor-thin slices of butter-soft pork held together with specially formulated crumbs. You&#146;d be hard pressed to find this quality in Japan, much less Singapore.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This unembellished, canteen-style French eatery is tucked away at a corner unit of Serene Centre. At La Petite, you queue up to place your order, and most dishes are served in fast-food fashion within 20 minutes of ordering. Don&#146;t expect staff to exchange niceties though; they just don&#146;t have time. Thirsty? Help yourself to the disposable cups at the water dispenser, please. These minor inconveniences are but a small price to pay for the highly affordable rustic French fare served on faded break-proof porcelain. The ambrosia of caramelised foie gras paired with orange confit, the dollops of shelled escargot doused in a rich, tomato-laced sauce and the outstanding desserts of cr&#232;me br&#251;l&#233;e and tarte tartin will make you feel like you&#146;re dining in a five-star joint.]]></description>

On eyeing up the choices, we&#146;re gunning to wolf down the oven-baked smoked cheese served with porcini, followed by the earshaped pasta with home-made pork sausage in spicy tomato sauce.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Nestled in a row of shophouses off Tanjong Pagar Road, this no-frills pub used to go under the moniker Shamus O&#146;Donnell&#146;s. Mixing it up a tad, new owners Aidan and Andrew have carried on some traditions (affordable booze) while adding their own (Guitar Hero, anyone)? What the pub lacks in aesthetics, the well-stocked bar makes up for; true to form, Guinness is on tap. For the more daring, the politically incorrect Irish Car Bomb ($20) will get your pistons pumping. Free of the pretensions of other bars in the &#146;hood, at O&#146;Bama&#146;s you can park your carcass and have a good chinwag, while chowing down on a Guinness-brewed Irish stew.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This eatery, planted on the ground floor of the former Tanglin Post Office, succeeds in its goal to provide a relaxed locale ideal for both singles and families. The concept seems to be working; during weekdays the office crowd takes root, but weekends are abuzz with parents and their saplings clambering over the on-site playground. The food is a bit ho-hum, with some menu items that read well on paper, but fail to meet up with the expectations they&#146;ve set. The soft-shell crab had that day-old aroma and the open-face steak sandwich, once we&#146;d waded through the lettuce and sliced tomatoes, was overdone. But the ambience helps make up for some of these flaws. Another redeeming factor is the desserts, with the antipodean favourite pavlova being an indulgent finale for two. The wine list is also plentiful, and first-rate fresh juices and smoothies will surely nourish your sagging branches.]]></description>

Serving Western staples such as salads, steak and finger-lickin&#146; ribs, by far the biggest pull for the uninitiated is the famous hotter-than-hot buffalo wings. Ranging from a &#145;mild&#146; level one, through to a suicidal level ten, these secret-recipe wings will have you sculling beer or lime margaritas before even contemplating the main event. Douse the flames with towers of crispy onion rings or creamily delicious coconut gelato. With no service charge or GST, it means the only thing not burning will be your pocket.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Halal Swedish food on Arab Street is a rare sight, and modern, whitewashed Fika certainly stands out in the mostly traditional area dominated by shophouses. The desserts are the clear winner here, while the mains are only so-so; tea-lovers will appreciate the personal pot service and eclectic selection of Gryphon teas. Avoid the unwieldy, open-faced sandwiches and stick with the sweet stuff: a just-right chocolate cake and Swedish pancakes with preserves go down a treat.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[There&#146;s nothing like a serving of zesty baba ghanouj and a spot of belly dancing to help you forget your woes. Both are in bountiful supply at SanoBar, now at Mohamed Sultan Road. Draped in earthy ochre tones, tapestries and mottled light, it&#146;s like entering the sanctity of a Bedouin tent at the end of a long trek through the desert. Middle Eastern mystique aside, the menu is sure to tantalise, ranging from meze starters such as vegetarian fattoush adorned with toasted pita bread, to the hearty lamb shank stewed in Mediterranean spices on a bed of raisin and pine-nut couscous. On Fridays and Saturdays skewered <em>shawarma </em>is served &#150; be sure to book early to land a prime position near the resident Lebanese dancer. Wind down by grabbing a big cushion or two and indulging in honey-sweet <em>mouhallabieh</em>, a cream pudding with mixed nuts, along with an iced mint tea.]]></description>

In addition to the usual suspects of sashimi, sushi, noodles and tempura, for a fixed price of $48++, you get the option to indulge in a $10 top-up for a free-flow of Grade 9 Australian Wagyu beef, served either shabu shabu- or sukiyaki-style. A few other top picks include a refreshing pork salad in sesame dressing, piquant kimchi fried rice and heavenly soft-shell crab maki.

				<description><![CDATA[After stints at Beppe De Vito&#146;s Il Lido, and then Forlino at One Fullerton, Michelin-starred chef Osvaldo Forlino decided to go solo with his new family-run restaurant venture. The charming, high-ceilinged restaurant with frosted cylindrical hanging lamps, and furniture specially shipped in from Italy, is redolent of the family&#146;s Piedmont roots. The menu includes dishes crafted from imported produce such as the melt-in-the-mouth Carmagnola capsicum stuffed with anchovy and tuna, as well as all-time favourites like caprese and stew of calamari, octopus, clams and mussels in a thick tomato base. The slippery parcels of Piedmont agnolotti in a light veal shank sauce should satisfy pasta lovers, as will the <em>al dente</em> tajarin with profoundly savoury squid-ink sauce. Even the ever-popular tiramisu oozes a unique quality. Putting aside the petite portions, our experience here was near-perfect.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This 41-year-old Teochew restaurant is one of the last of its kind in Singapore; think fluorescent-lit dining room, bright-pink foldable chairs and faded wood-panelled walls. Occupying three units of shophouses, Lee Kui is also known as <em>Ah Hoi</em> &#150; or crab in Teochew. As the name implies, people flock here for one thing &#150; the famous cold crabs. But if the hefty price tag of about $70 per kg hurts, consider wallet-friendly alternatives from the extensive menu of stir-fries, stews, deep-fried and steamed dishes. We highly recommend the crisp and moist oyster omelette, served with refreshing sprigs of coriander; savoury eight-treasure vegetarian stew that includes melt-in-the-mouth cabbage and moss in a oyster-sauce laced gravy; and the braised duck wings served in a claypot bubbling with a dark and rich brew. Complete your meal on a high note with the sweet and unctuous ambrosia of <em>or nee </em>(yam paste), crowned with gingko nuts and creamy mashed pumpkins.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Show me a sign, just show me a sign&#133; &#146; These were the words running through my head as we aimlessly wandered around the ground floor of The Sail, the luxury condominium at Marina Bay, in our search for Rocks. While making my reservation on the phone, restaurant staff had failed to mention I should pack a GPS and a bucket load of patience in order to find the place. Tip: it&#146;s on the second floor, closest to the big orange escalator.
Within seconds we&#146;re greeted by the friendly wait-staff and I&#146;m soon perusing the reasonably priced wine list (glasses from just $10) and the food menu, which unsurprisingly has a strong selection of grilled meats, but a surprisingly strong selection of seafood. Not long after, we&#146;re tucking into half a dozen grilled oysters with subtle overtones of lime juice, soy sauce and wasabi. Even better is the fresh kingfish ceviche which is bursting with acidity and punch, courtesy of some lime, chilli and shallots. For mains we decide to test out the grill and order a 250gm tenderloin and 350gm sirloin, both 120-day grain-fed pieces of Australian beef. The complementary sauces include b&#233;arnaise, togarashi and red wine. Portion-wise, we&#146;re not disappointed. These steaks are huge. But once again, we&#146;re shown that size isn&#146;t always everything &#150; both are a tad overcooked and a little on the bland side. The truffle mashed potatoes and saut&#233;ed wild mushrooms were standout sides.

On my second time around, with two hungry girlfriends in tow, I order some dishes I&#146;d been eyeing the previous visit. The sizzling beef <em>maki </em>sits at the top of the list. Served on a hot stone, three slices of tenderloin are rolled up and accompanied by a soy wasabi sauce. The trick is to let them sizzle for as long, or as short, as you like. This dish is a winner. It&#146;s tender, fragrant and tasty. For my main, I tuck into the cod <em>papillote proven&#231;ale </em>&#150; which is essentially a fish steamed in a foil bag with onion, tomato and herbs. While the dish is high on the &#145;wow&#146; factor in terms of presentation, it is lacking on the taste front. The barbecued chilli crab cakes are a major disappointment because, well, they look and taste more like rubbery Thai fish cakes. Luckily, sides of gratinated root vegetables and French fries help to save the day.
Rocks has all the makings of a solid restaurant. The decor, service and location are convenient for the after-work and work-lunch crowd, and Marina Bay will only continue to get busier. The menu is hitting the right notes &#150; the wood-fired pizzas and the Rocks&#146; cheeseburger look particularly third-trip worthy &#150; but I have a feeling that Rocks needs to bed itself in just a little more, refine the menu and give the food more <em>oomph</em>. Not to mention investing in proper ground-floor signage.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Indonesian chef Gunawan Wibisono, a former prot&#233;g&#233; of American Iron Chef Morimoto Masaharu, has attempted to create another one of those &#145;modern Japanese&#146; restaurants with never-seen-before dishes at Dempsey Hill&#146;s Zento. His creative efforts have not, unlike many rival eateries, been put completely to shame.
Any waiter who starts off your meal with a free cup of sake is okay in my books. This turned out to be a smart move on his part, as my good first impressions gradually decreased throughout the night. First off, when ordering the carpaccio topped with ginger garlic yozu sauce, he enquired whether we would like that served with yellowtail or Wagyu beef &#150; conveniently failing to mention that the Wagyu choice would double the price listed on the menu. It was a good thing that the razor-thin slices of meat, drizzled with hot grapeseed oil used to sear the top, turned out to be a favourite dish of both myself and my companion; it helped, too, that we were not aware of the add-on at the time.
In addition, all the waiters had a habit of hovering like vultures, and while my dining partner was lucky to be facing the wall, I was eating nervously, feeling that the second I put down my chopsticks, my dish would be scooped up before I could savour the last remaining bites. Having said that, we appreciated the over-attentiveness when, upon arriving on a rainy afternoon for our second visit, an umbrella-equipped waiter ran outside to the taxi to provide cover for the walk to the restaurant. Service aside, let&#146;s get back to the food. The innovative Wagyu Beef Roll is stuffed with shrimp tempura and topped with thin slices of gruy&#232;redrizzled beef, and I&#146;m delighted to say that it was not just the cheese but the entire roll which melted in my mouth. With sushi, it&#146;s never bad to go the old-school route (read: 40 years after the inception of the California roll, this seems like a fair classification) to see how some of the more &#145;traditional&#146; rolls compare. This proved to be a wise decision when it came to the Volcano Roll, whose copious lashings of spicy mayo were perfectly cut with sweet eel sauce.
During our second visit, we decided to go with a standard lunch sushi set ($35) &#150; this one being served straight up, no frills attached. With no sauces or surprise ingredients left to mask the quality of the fish, our eight-nigiri, five-sushi selection did not match up to the high standard set by the more imaginative rolls. Standing on its own, the rice lacked that sticky sweetness needed when creating a bed for the fish. The thick cuts of average fish were also not helping matters. It seems as though it&#146;s best for chef Wibisono to keep thinking outside the box, since the final result is much more enjoyable to unpack.
It&#146;s probably best to skip on dessert; the undistinguished green-tea cr&#232;me br&#251;l&#233;e presented a curdled centre and the chocolate lava cake &#150; while delicious &#150; was not anything new. And it&#146;s just as well: the bill adds up quickly without, and after discovering how our carpaccio had mischievously doubled in price, we were eager to head out of the door.
Costs: <em>Lunch sets $18-$65; dinner sets $58-$120. </em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Bont&#225;&#146;s new stablemate gushes in its web-blurb about its &#145;beautiful surroundings&#146;, a setting which &#145;embraces nature and exudes serenity&#146;. The self-proclaimed laid-back and rustic atmosphere has you expecting something resembling Raw Kitchen Bar&#146;s middle-of-nowhere foodie cabin, or PS. Caf&#233; on Dempsey. In reality, co-owner and chef Luca Pezzera&#146;s latest venture shares little in common with these other two restaurants. For starters, District 10 is only a stone&#146;s throw from a busy road junction, next to a flashy electronics showroom. Occupying the site of a former school, the outdoor dining area sits bang next to a rough brick wall, as if you were eating in a student union canteen.
On the soggy Friday night we visited, our first impressions were compounded by an insanely noisy radio blasting bland pop directly overhead, latticework roofing leaking raindrops on our chairs, plates and heads, and a hideous dripping affair next to us like some sort of inverted well, better suited to Underwater World than a restaurant.
As my companion&#146;s drink arrived (but not mine), the laughable starter came too: five pieces of crunchy crostini a couple of millimetres thick, topped with a blancmange-like fishy paste. Devouring rocket leaves to keep ourselves going, we watched in amusement as the wait-staff bustled around us like headless chickens, two of them having a blazing row in a service area ornately decorated with a saggy black bin bag. Our chairs vibrated every time someone dashed across the decking, so the entire meal felt like we were on a particularly uncomfortable funfair ride, <em>sans </em>the fun.

The vino may be imported from &#145;boutique wineries&#146;, and indeed the Zonin prosecco tasted delicious, but it lasted two sips. Our mains suffered from the opposite syndrome: the sirloin steak was more than generous, but not cooked to order, while the fish and chips order was copious but anaemic. I asked for some salt to jazz it up, but the seemingly esoteric request was lost in translation, and it took a second go before the elusive condiment arrived. You can&#146;t fault their efficiency; my partner&#146;s plate was whisked away before I&#146;d finished, and while my Stella Artois had taken 15 minutes to be delivered, the bill arrived in seconds flat.
So although I was reluctant to return, I was extremely glad I did. In almost every respect our second visit, this time indoors, was a superior experience. The staff led us into the light-filled, spacious dining room dominated by teak tables and chairs, and a huge wine cellar. Things were looking up already, especially with the arrival of two exemplary drinks. A virgin mojito at just $5.20 was so good my companion didn&#146;t miss the alcohol at all; a smoky, deeply mellow Fredda Barolo house red ($12) set me up perfectly for the main course.
But I should have known from the non-Italian spelling of &#145;lasagne bolognaise&#146; (it&#146;s <em>bolognese, </em>fact fans) this wasn&#146;t the genuine article, and so it proved. The inside was crumbly instead of meaty and cheesy, and lukewarm rather than piping hot. It tasted like a ready meal from Mustafa Centre&#146;s frozen section, shoved in the microwave, but not for long enough. They didn&#146;t have any trouble drumming up a regional dish, however: the crayfish noodle was well presented and infused with delicately sweet Thai flavours. Although on the small side, the crayfish was compensated by a generous portion of prawns and noodles. If previous courses had their faults, the chefs redeemed themselves with a remarkable cr&#232;me br&#251;l&#233;e, textured to perfection, whose generous lashings of rum packed a seriously heady wallop.
Shared between two, this was enough to end the meal on a very high (and ever-so-slightly inebriated) note. The staff are well-intentioned, but essentially clueless, and their hurried style lends the whole set-up an amateurish air. Sport fiends on a beered-up weekender will fit in perfectly at the imposing bar, with its huge TV screen showing football. And there&#146;s no doubt that for many, both local and foreign, this is a winning formula; at weekends it does a roaring trade. But choosier diners seeking quiet surrounds and <em>cordon bleu </em>cuisine could find District 10 a costly disappointment.
<em>Main courses $12-$24.</em>

				<description><![CDATA[In the rather intriguing PR slug-fest to crown the new king of shopping malls in Singapore &#150; the ION or Orchard Central &#150; crowd numbers seem to be giving the thumbs-up to the former. Of course, whether the people milling around the ION&#146;s bold-faced shops are actually buying anything is another story because, for the moment, all the cash-register action seems to be taking place in the vast food basements. All of which made the rather deathly silence of Orchard Central&#146;s eighth-floor restaurant promenade on a recent visit just that little bit more eerie.
The Shaanxi menu at Duo Le benefits from its plum location right next to the schizophrenic lifts (get into the wrong one at ground level and you&#146;ll shoot right past the floor you want), but that also means if you&#146;re seated near the void, you &#150; and the low-key chinoiseried interiors with highlights of orchids &#150; are bathed in very unflattering fluorescent light.
And maybe it was because there were only two other occupied tables that night (one of which appeared to be family members of the owners), but the solicitous service bordered on the intrusive. The captain stood sentry right by our table and watched us crunch into the stack of crisp, oversized winter melon sticks that had been soaked in orange juice from a carton (and yes, you could tell it wasn&#146;t freshly squeezed). &#145;How is it?&#146; she asked. Go away, I prayed. Meanwhile, dishes emerged from the kitchen at such a clip, we wondered aloud if the restaurant was closing early that night. Or maybe this is the speed at which people in Shaanxi province eat? The ever-vigilant captain marched swiftly into the kitchen and slammed on the brakes. Thankfully, the kitchen&#146;s enthusiasm, matched with a sure and confident direction, in many ways almost created a palimpsest of a Crystal Jade. The thinly shaved rounds of sweetly flavoured, aspic pork knuckles, for instance, were familiar, though a lively kick came courtesy of the chilliflecked vinegar dip.

And despite the starched linen, the quietly swanky setting and the thick-papered glossy menu, Duo Le successfully avoids pretentious culinary tricks. So, the vegetarian plate of cashews and mushrooms, streaked with slivers of yellow and green peppers, brimmed with comforting garlicky and oniony flavours. <em>Zha zhiang mian </em>&#150; the natural white and spinach hued loops blending with a creamy hard-boiled egg &#150; was tossed with a subtle gravy of mince and bean paste; and the bijoux thinned skinned dumplings flooded the mouth with sweet meaty, chive-scented juice. However, due to either a simple lack of imagination, or a somewhat miserly approach to the menu, there are only four desserts to choose from. None caught the eye; a verdict confirmed with the arrival of a dull rock-sugar flavoured soup of white fungus streaked with the same store bought orange juice that had earlier graced the winter melon sticks. It was a telling lapse, one that you couldn&#146;t help thinking, as you walked out, would never have happened at Crystal Jade.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Patrons stake out this brightly-coloured shop for its ever-changing roster of gelato flavours. With a rotating cast of 24 to choose from, top favourites include durian, frutti di bosco (a mixture of three berries), bacio (nuts and chocolate) and passionfruit. If you&#146;re hungry for more than a scoop (from $3.30 per scoop to $9.80 for a palette of six), take home a tub of 500g ($12.90) or go all out with the one kilo pack ($23.90).]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Every neighbourhood needs a local, and Maple Pub has been filling this niche for some time now. It attracts a regular crowd of thirty-somethings who chow down on yakitori sticks, washing it all back with mugs of ice-cold beer. On Tuesdays and Saturdays, free snacks such as chicken wings and fishcakes are served, while Wednesdays and Saturdays see special beer promotions pushed during the happy hour period (4-9pm). Tapping into Singapore&#146;s love for anything free, the pub also holds a regular lucky draw. For every $100 spent, patrons can win booze goodies ranging from a mug of beer to a bottle of Martell.]]></description>

				<title>Nostalgia Hotel</title>

				<description><![CDATA[&#145;The new Nostalgia hotel in Tiong Bahru is boutique&#146;, says proprietor John White. And he&#146;s right. The hotel has some character and it&#146;s small, but the word &#145;boutique&#146; has more likely been used here to dodge an official star rating, which would need to take into account the hotel&#146;s quite claustrophobic interior. There are 50 rooms to choose from, and while some are larger than others, the smaller ones are, at 13 sq m, comparable to a walk-in closet. The main dining room is made up of just 12 tiny tables, and the outdoor pool is clearly for dipping only. In fact, it&#146;s as if the entire hotel sucked up the &#145;drink me&#146; potion from <em>Alice&#146;s Adventures in Wonderland </em>before it shrank into some kind of mini-hotel.
Funnily enough, stepping inside the hotel&#146;s doors is just like falling down a mystical rabbit hole too, all the way back to the opium haze of Singapore in the &#146;60s. Back then, when the city was mostly marshland, the Tiong Bahru district was made up of shophouses, and its residents were predominantly working girls and mistresses. Thanks to all the glamorous lasses being &#145;put up&#146; by up-andcoming businessmen in bell-bottoms, the area became known as &#145;Singapore&#146;s Hollywood&#146;, and its homes most politely referred to as &#145;dens of beauties&#146;.
<br />
<em>Nostalgia Hotel's Queen Suite</em>
It&#146;s a sexy history the Nostalgia hotel keeps close to its heart, and in its bedrooms, where artistic portraits of smouldering damsels gaze at guests from their canvas settings. These keyholes to the past are a plus for the hotel: the art is original (all done by local artist Andrea Tan) and the rest of the decor, from the gold trimmings to the crystal chandeliers, is tastefully art deco. Moreover, individual rooms come with customised name cards, and in-room bars are stocked with seven varieties of liquor and champagne. Downstairs, the foyer smells like home cooking and spicy vanilla, a lovely aroma that leads the curious directly to the hotel&#146;s alfresco dining area. Here, the food is gourmet fusion fare and the drinks are made to order. All things considered, and in keeping with the hotel&#146;s name, there&#146;s a lovely journey to be had here. Sadly, the room charge at the end would likely see even dreamy Alice jolted awake, rudely, from her stay in Wonderland.

				<description><![CDATA[New to our island of peace and tranquility is Wave House Sentosa. This new attraction brings simulated surfing to our waveless shores. Seasoned surfers can grab their boards and have a go at the FlowBarrel (and its simulated loft wave), while newbies can attempt to find their feet on the FlowRider. For others who would rather stay out of the surf, there is a pool and two beach bars to keep you occupied.
<em><strong>Costs:</strong> Admission $10 (Mon-Thu), $20 (Fri &#38; Sat), fully redeemable for food, drinks and rides. $30 (FlowRider), $45 (FlowBarrel).</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Bliss Spa has fi nally arrived in Singapore. Setting up shop within the Sephora ION Orchard store, the Bliss set-up will feature a nail lounge, four recliners for on-the-spot minitreatments (try the oxygen blasts and seaweed masks) and four cosy (we think they mean small) &#145;capsule&#146; rooms for such treatments as the triple oxygen energising mask, or the hot milk and almond pedicure. Services aside, what sets Bliss apart are the cute extras &#150; a spa buffet with brownies, olives, crackers and cheese, and if you book any two treatments in a 30-minute time slot, or any three within 45 minutes, you&#146;ll be distracted with a classic movie.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Chef Jean-Charles Dubois makes the most of the awkwardly narrow dining room, uncomfortable banquette seats and even tinier kitchen. The menu is, like the space, small, but the dishes are executed with Gallic finesse. Try the dainty vol au vent, encasing fragrant sweetbreads, for example. Or the high, clear notes of a consomm&#233;, or the delicately wrought lamb chops seared with rosemary. Sometimes, though, this finesse is carried to extremes, as with the cod bouillabaisse; while perfectly flavoured and crisp, this main course was so small, the $35 price tag was a recessionary slap in the face.
<em>Main courses $35-$45. Five-course d&#233;gustation menu $88++.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[With its myriad buzzing KTV lounges and sleazy nightclubs, Joo Chiat seems to be anchored as Singapore&#146;s alternative red-light precinct, but the foodies among us know that its distinctive dining culture is part of its inimitable charm. Take the Teochew tze char (stir fry) stall Xu Jun Sheng Chao Zhou Mei Shi, a fluorescent-lit pre-war coffee shop. For 60 years it has been dishing out piping hot Teochew porridge from an unembellished kopitiam at Joo Chiat (incidentally, they recently moved across the street to another unit). On offer are heartwarming classics arranged on a glass counter including slow-braised pork knuckles in a thick, dark brew, and fried-to-order ngoh hiang (meat rolls). But what really steals the show is the star seafood cast: a whole pomfret fish steamed simply with salted vegetables in a light consomm&#233;; chunks of cold crab brimming with creamy golden roe; and a crispy wok-fried oyster omelette. Their not too sweet <em>or nee</em> (yam paste) crowned with chunks of golden pumpkin is the best we&#146;ve had in a long time.
<em>Main courses $4-$35.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[There was a time when foodies assumed the torpid neighbourhood of Macpherson would never make it on to their &#145;must eat&#146; radar screen, but it did. Thanks to Ming Kee, which opened five years ago, Macpherson has been drawing a steady stream of food bloggers and gourmets; even a well-known dignitary has graced this eatery, as evidenced by the pictures that neatly adorn the curtain-lined walls. The lure? Rustic, non-denominational Chinese food seasoned with aplomb. As the name implies, the star attraction here is the live seafood displayed discreetly in tanks at the back of the air-conditioned restaurant. The cr&#232;me de la cr&#232;me of the seafood is the luscious steamed mussels &#150; which look more like giant clams &#150; in an addictive, fried garlic-streaked sauce. The claypot Sri Lankan crab tossed with crab roe-studded bee hoon, another popular dish here, was pleasant but slightly overdone. Other items that shine from the extensive menu include the tender fried spare ribs flavoured with a Guinness sauce and the bubbling-hot claypot bean curd with seasonal vegetables.

				<description><![CDATA[The nondescript location, tucked away behind Orchard Parade Hotel, hasn&#146;t stopped regulars from coming back. Grandma&#146;s was opened in late 2008 by the same folk who run the popular Akashi Japanese Restaurant. Boldly flavoured Malaysian and Singaporean favourites are whipped up by chef Yong Shang Hoo, formerly of KL&#146;s Madam Kwan, and famous for his nasi lemak speciality. Yong&#146;s version here is equally well executed. You&#146;ll find chicken curry perfumed with rich coconut milk, sambal ikan bilis (fried dried anchovies), shrimp floss, egg and achar (pickles), all sharing the plate with the coconut-infused rice. Other standout dishes include juicy assam prawns, bound with a punchy sauce and heaps of onions and chilli; beyond-tender beef rendang balanced with aromatic spices; and wokfragrant char kway teow. You can round off the meal with chendol or sago gula melaka. Both treats were laced with the thick home-made palm sugar syrup and freshly squeezed coconut milk.

				<description><![CDATA[One of ION Orchard&#146;s new hotspots, this Hong Kong transplant is a good place to scoff down comfort Cantonese fare before hitting the stores. If you are there for lunch, try some of the more unusual dim sum selections, such as fish maw stuffed with minced pork and prawns, or bouncy crystal coriander dumplings. Moving along to the mains, we found a good range of perfect-for-sharing dishes. The foil-baked garoupa fillet, crisp on the outside and succulent inside, is matched with a boldly flavoured barbecue sauce. Equally impressive is the beef tenderloin and brisket stewed with daikon slices until incredibly tender. The wok-tossed fried rice is a must-have, speckled with egg, dried scallops and seafood, it is served in a stone bowl to keep the ingredients warm. Tip: if you don&#146;t scoop it up fast enough the last grains will dry up. The service is lacking, but keep in mind that the restaurant is new and still smoothing out a few kinks.]]></description>

Boasting the juiciest patties on the island, The Hand Burger also does a mean Nutella shake (warning: it&#146;s sinful), and our favourite $3 mint iced lychee refresher. They also bake their own bread and sell it to go. Check out their brand new branch at 313@Somerset. We&#146;re not so sure about the name, though&#133;]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Contrary to its name, this little cocktail bar is overflowing neither with people nor with staff. Tucked away on an odd little side street in the depths of Robertson Walk, Flow&#146;s dark exterior and tinted windows would actually make for a perfect brothel. Open the large glass doors, and you&#146;ll find that the interior makes the same impression. But this little dark bar is a hidden gem, and we&#146;re quite reticent to share it, because here you&#146;ll find a drinker&#146;s dream come true. The menu offers lists of whiskies, scotches, gins and cocktails as long as your arm, and its bar staff know what they&#146;re doing. The Long Island iced tea lives up to its name &#150; it is &#145;long&#146; indeed &#150; and incredibly strong. Hurrah! And the dry martini deserves a medal as well. Please promise that you won&#146;t run around town spreading the word.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Fifteen minutes of what? Unless you&#146;re on Facebook, you&#146;ll need to go and see for yourself, because this students&#146; bar-cum-restaurant-cum-live music venue at LaSalle College of the Arts is only marketing itself through the social networking site. In line with the architecture within which it&#146;s couched, this split-level, open-plan space is, at first glance, pretty impressive. And more than that, it&#146;s something quite different for Singapore. Ignore the overly exposed ceiling pipes, along with the godawful acoustics and far-too-bright lighting, and you&#146;ll have found yourself an excellent place to pretend you&#146;re studying (read: chill with your friends). The major draw is a decent line-up of amateur live bands and DJ gigs, with a few open-mic nights thrown in for good measure. The drinks menu is okay; there are all sorts of spirits and quite a few beers, but our advice is to stay away from the cocktails. The very friendly barmen are being terribly honest when they say they&#146;re not quite sure how to make them.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[What do you get when you cross tom yum soup with a German lager? Tawandang Microbrewery. Yet another<br />
addition to the perennially hip enclave of Dempsey Hill, this Thai-owned restaurant offers an unusual pairing. Three signature German beers are brewed on-site and can be paired with dishes like flaming tom yum goong with river prawns, and papaya salad with salted crab. Those looking to follow a more traditional route can opt for melt-inyour- mouth deep-fried pork knuckle and sausages, topped up with sauerkraut. From Tuesday through Saturday the cavernous restaurant reverberates with the innately nasal but endearing sounds of an authentic Thai band, delivering local ballads and English covers. While its sheer size makes it hard to attract waiting staff, Tawandang has the type of atmosphere you cannot &#145;beer&#146; to pass up.

				<description><![CDATA[Pinched from a Michelinstarred restaurant in London, chef Paul Longworth now presides over a blackswathed, glass-encased dining room wherehe performs his culinary nips, tucks and chops behind a U-shaped marble-topped table. The result? A part-French, part-Swiss vino-incarnated gastrobar &#150; the restaurant offers 200 bottles of Swiss wine. We love the caviar-flecked mussel velout&#233;, tender slowbraised ox cheeks laced with caramelised shallots and snapper in a heavenly, red pepper-reduced sauce crowned with green olive pearls. To top up the Swiss theme, raclette and fondue also find their way onto the menu.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Bistro Senso straddles that uncomfortable spot between caf&#233; and fast-food joint. Art-deco chandeliers hang over black-and-white tiling, which sounds charming but feels forced. The pizzas are definitely your best bet on these laminated menus, and I have to admit the prosciutto pizza was delicious, though the thin crust was so soft that it quickly warped into an oozing mess. Oh, and if your eyes widen at the 8-foot pizzas for $8.90 option, they mean 8 inches. All said, Bistro Senso is a viable option if you&#146;ve been dragged to the Singapore Flyer by overly enthusiastic, out-of-town relatives; its prices are a snip compared to most other restaurants in the area. Except, of course, Pizza Hut.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The rich flavours, exquisite pairings and a dash of <em>je ne sais quoi </em>make us go weak at the knees for the fine cuisine at L&#146;Entrep&#244;t &#150; French for warehouse. The best part is that the easily digestible bill prevents this experience from burning a hole in your pocket. Set against the bustle of the Singapore River, this quiet promenade eatery dishes out flavoursome favourites. After breaking the golden emmental crust of the French onion soup, the cheese stretches perfectly from the bowl to your mouth. Quail is covered with risotto and served with foie gras, field mushrooms and the essence of black-truffle jus to enhance the dish. For further indulgence, the meal should conclude with classic cr&#234;pes Suzette, the caramelised sugar and tangy orange rind making this the perfect grand finale. The intimate atmosphere, coupled with a wait-staff that knows its vin from its veau, make for a delectable night out.

				<description><![CDATA[The latest addition to what is fast becoming &#145;Avenue Les Amis&#146;, Bistro du Vin is already a hot favourite with the island&#146;s foodies. Attempting to secure an 8.30pm reservation on a Saturday night put me on the waitlist, even with 48 hours&#146; notice; thankfully, someone cancelled. Helmed by chef Philip Lee &#150; Justin Quek&#146;s right-hand man for years &#150; the menu contains the usual litany of French standards: onion soup, burgundy escargots with garlic, and herbs and steak frites. But what really caught our attention was the charcuterie platter. The Joselito de Bellota Gran Reserva was simply divine and set the mood for the rest of the meal; a balsamic reduction cut into the creamy goodness of the pan-fried foie gras. And while the duck confit came out a tad salty, it was saved by hand-cut chips that were fried to perfection. Unfortunately there wasn&#146;t room for dessert, but peeking over at our neighbouring table&#146;s choice of profiteroles and a thin-crust apple tart, a second visit was definitely on the cards.

				<description><![CDATA[Nestled in the back of the Tanjong Pagar Plaza HDB, this tiny takeaway bakery is a gem among the local dry cleaners and coffee shops. A single fluffy muffin is enough for breakfast on the go, but with flavours ranging from cheese to double chocolate to blueberry, you&#146;ll be hard pressed to choose just one. Other sweet treats include chocolate walnut brownies and a hearty strawberry cheesecake. The peach ground almond fruit flan is a standout, a crisp pie crust full of fruit and a moist, tart-like filling that&#146;s most definitely not your typical gelatinous custard from a can. Take care not to arrive too late in the afternoon, as once they run out of freshly baked goods, they close up shop for the day.

				<description><![CDATA[Making that first visit to Good Old Frog Porridge on Outram Road may very well be a life-changing decision. Once you&#146;ve savoured these tender appendages, there is no turning back. Served piping hot, the succulent meat comes out in an earthen clay pot with heaps of sliced ginger and spring onions in a thick, fragrant pool of dark soysauce gravy &#150; blistering dried chillis are optional. This utterly addictive brew is best slurped down with silky smooth congee and a plate of shallot-topped chye sim on the side. Wash it all down with a glass of iced herbal tea. Note: if you purchase four frogs you get one free.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Looking for something glam but with an edge of cool? Pedder Red&#146;s Autumn/ Winter 2009 collection has elements that meld the season&#146;s themes: Rocker, Cool Hunter and Bohemian. Think leather, zippers and faux fur and animal prints. We love the wristlet with a little skull head ($35), strappy shoes ($195), and the metallic tasselled cuffs ($45).]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The spectacular views of Marina Bay from the lofty heights of the Fullerton Hotel are only an added bonus to the excellent menu that chef Diego Martinelli has put together. The dishes provide rich flavours with a light, modern touch. The standout starters include steamed mussels in a tomato, chilli and caper sauce; spice-dusted goose liver with a fennel salad; and sea scallops with a crust of black olive and sun-dried tomatoes is an absolute delight. Tortellini stuffed with duck and mascarpone, and topped with a rosemary sauce, is a highlight among the main courses, as was the Wagyu beef tenderloin with creamed celeriac and porcini jus. The grand finale arrived in the form of a melting-heart chocolate and coconut fondant, as well as strawberries saut&#233;ed in balsamic vinegar.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Next door to Society Club, the entrance to the just-opened Umami &#150; a name that references one of the five basic Japanese tastes &#150; resembles a posh hotel lobby. A friendly hostess joins guests from behind the &#145;check-in&#146; counter and leads you into the dining area. The dark orange, crushed velvet booths wrap around tables made from thick slabs of granite, creating an intimate atmosphere for diners.
Umami describes itself on its website as &#145;a Japanese restaurant unlike any other&#146;, a rather vague claim that&#146;s impossible to dispute. So as to avoid sounding like a narrow-minded food snob who can&#146;t appreciate creative chefs, I would like to preface this by stating that I am all about taking chances when it comes to food. However, many of the dishes being served at Umami resembled an experiment gone bust &#150; recipes seemed to leave out key ingredients, or strongly lack substance.
Starting the meal, we had high hopes for chopped up toro sprinkled with caviar, but it arrived in a serving that only <em>just </em>filled the shot glass and could easily be scooped up in one teaspoon. There was barely enough to have a proper taste &#150; especially when all of these dishes are meant to be shared. All I could tell was the black eggs didn&#146;t even come close to bursting in my mouth, perhaps because there were only ten in total. One dish that <em>did </em>deserve praise was the braised tongue. The meat was cut thinly and complemented with a drop of strong Japanese mustard to provide bold flavour.
Another standout dish was served later in the meal &#150; though regrettably, it was memorable for the wrong reason. I assumed that a spicy tuna roll would be served raw, not from what tasted like canned fish. The waiter was eager to receive feedback following many of our dishes, and when the issue of cooked sushi was addressed, he assured us that while the meat was cooked, it was of &#145;high quality&#146;. I wanted to tell him that the restaurant would be better off buying it from 7-Eleven; it would have cut costs and tasted exactly the same. The minuscule portions of food that were served left us so hungry that we ended up heading to Little India and digging into dinner number two.

Low expectations led to a few pleasant surprises upon our second visit. The menu had been slightly tweaked and thankfully the greasy sea urchin spring rolls we&#146;d sampled at our first meal, filled with less than a pinch of <em>uni </em>and sprinkled with minimal flavour, were no longer being served. Several other revisions had been made to the selections. Thinly sliced strings of cuttlefish had been battered like tempura and served on a round dish, surrounded by sweet Japanese mayonnaise and sprinkled with bright red chilli powder. Cuttlefish can often leave you chewing long after you&#146;re ready to swallow, but the smooth texture of the complementary sauce allowed us to enjoy it the whole way through.
Folded pieces of lightly seared salmon were each topped with a thin slice of cherry tomato and placed on a long, narrow dish. Small dots of pale green wasabi framed the fish, and added a little kick to each bite. It is evident that Umami puts a lot of thought into the presentation, and there are flavours that can be savoured. The problem was that portion size was still falling short, dish after dish. When trying to gauge an idea of how many dishes to order, we enquired about the braised pork. We were told eight slices would be served, but when it showed up, there were only four on the plate. While this was sufficient for two as a taster, it was more a matter of principle. What appears to be fat that health-conscious diners would cut off turns out to be the best part, and would be insultingly wasteful to remove.
The staff seem open to suggestions, a good sign that they are looking to improve the food. We would like to stay open-minded and hope that this new restaurant will be able to fix all its kinks, but all we know is that there&#146;s a lot of work to be done. If this is unlike any &#145;other&#146; Japanese restaurant, I think we&#146;ll have to stick with the others.
<em><strong>Costs: </strong>Main courses $12-$30.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Carved out of a Peranakan shophouse, Speakeasy&#146;s seating capacity amounts to just four outdoor tables, but there&#146;s not the merest whiff of exclusivity that such minimal provision might suggest. As you saunter into the bar area, a roaring twenties soundtrack floats above chic panelling and glass-filled cabinets. Ask your friendly host to pour you a wine or beer, or mix you a &#145;Prohibition-era cocktail&#146;, and settle on a comfy bench next to a friendly tortoiseshell cat. Even the opening hours seem somehow cool: just four nights a week, with $8 cocktails on a Wednesday. Evocatively blending modern pizzazz with retro-chic yet not a mite pretentious, Speakeasy amounts to the ultimate date venue. We&#146;re almost loath to mention this tiny treasure; we&#146;d love it to remain bar-world&#146;s best-kept secret.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Decadent, dark and strangely alluring is how to best describe the newest entry to Singapore&#146;s nightclub scene. With its swirling lasers, blue-hued shadows, forest motifs and sprawling mirrored bar, this large-scale club-bar-restaurant is following a theme established by its Japanese-inspired landlord, Liang Court. There are snooker and karaoke lounges, and plans to add Wii, Xbox and PS3 facilities &#150; it&#146;s like Little Tokyo. On the weekends pony-tailed &#145;Harajuku girls&#146; strut the dance floor, as suited wait-staff make the rounds. While big on aesthetics, Social House is still finding its place in the clubbing scene, but with a worthy cocktail list and the entertainment extras, it&#146;s sure to &#145;turn you Japanese&#146; for one night.]]></description>

Those who relish a quality drop will wholly embrace the extensive drink menu by renowned Japanese mixologist Tomoyuki Kitazoe. Martinis are the speciality of choice, mixing up unusual combinations of pomelo with basil and dragon fruit with vanilla. For the purists who sniff at such infusions, have a taste before judging.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[There are two things you must bear in mind: one, the name refers neither to body parts, nor to the plumage on roosters. Two, there are almost 40 cocktails &#150; shaken, stirred, mixed and foamed &#150; on the menu. You can stick to the standards but what&#146;s the fun in that? Try the Chocolate Indulgence ($16), a &#145;dessert cocktail&#146; that uses Hershey&#146;s chocolate spiked with alcohol and garnished with vanilla flakes. Several of Cock&#146;s Feather&#146;s cocktails cater to those with a sweet tooth, so if you&#146;re looking for something dry, go with wine. Skip their molecular cocktails: the Foamy Bellini ($20) looks like a golden Guinness, but the champagne and peach do not integrate at all. Drop by between 8pm and 10pm to buy one cocktail and get one free. They state firmly that both cocktails must be the same, but rules are meant to be broken&#133;if you ask nicely.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Just as oysters are rough on the outside but hold polished pearls within their clutches, Le Perle Noir is a pleasant surprise among the dark-windowed sports bars and massage parlours that surround it. Diners can sit on the leafy outdoor patio, or step inside to the much more civilised, wood-bedecked interior. The scallop entr&#233;e was perfectly seared and paired with a tuft of bacon-infused arugula and drizzled with an orange whisky sauce. The prosciuttowrapped cod was a real palate-dazzler, resting regally on its bed of mustardy Puy lentils and finished with a brushstroke of macadamia nut pesto. As fusion-filled as the menu is, some of the true delights here are the simplest &#150; a mouthwatering grilled pork chop, mussels in your choice of broth, or super-fresh oysters. A bit pricey, but aren&#146;t all pearls?]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Young families seem to have earmarked this spot for casual weekend dining. Why they&#146;ve picked it is open for debate, but certainly the spacious alfresco area, a ready supply of high chairs and ample parking serve as contributing factors. The menu of Eurocentric dishes doesn&#146;t hurt either. The rich seafood bisque is hearty in taste with just a hint of spice; the duck salad makes for a delicious mouthful of bitter, sweet and sour, its slices of duck on crisp rocket leaves dressed with a raspberry- and dill-infused citrus sauce. A bowl of carbonara, with a generous serving of bacon, prompted the suggestion of a lazy afternoon nap before the dessert sampler &#150; a divine combination of sticky date pudding, panna cotta, cr&#232;me br&#251;l&#233;e and apple cobbler with cinnamon ice cream &#150; made it a dead cert.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This 60-year-old casual eatery is jam-packed with plastic tables, the walls are peeling and the detritus left behind by enthusiastic diners on curry-stained bowls may offer nothing more than a sordid sight. But this still does not detract from the lush and homey Malay fare on offer. Standout dishes include the wickedly dense and extravagantly spiced beef rendang; the light but no less spicy tamarind-laced ikan penggang in black sweet sauce with a fresh toss of onions and chillis; the mild-on-heat but rich-in-flavour ayam bakar; and the crisp, moist and onion-streaked fried omelette. Don&#146;t miss their house soup, a savoury beef consomm&#233; with caramelised shallots and chunks of potatoes and carrots.
<em><strong>Costs:</strong> Main courses $5</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This sprawling local eatery &#150; spanning three shophouses and a canalside patio area &#150; is fast becoming a one-stop-shop for connoisseurs of flavourful crab and everything else the sea has to offer. Delivered fast and fresh, Big Eater serves up crab cooked 14 ways, including house specialities with salted egg, black pepper and stewed with beehoon. This is complemented by eight styles of succulent king prawns, lobster and more than 20 other chef&#146;s musttries. Ice-cold jugs of beer are available and the staff is more than willing to help you net the best selections. Of course if you reach your quota, you can always da bao (takeaway) and tackle it again when the appetite allows. Shelling out close to 200 crabs daily on weekends, you&#146;d be wise to book your big catch ahead of time.]]></description>

Not quite sure what suits your bosom? Help is at hand in the form of an interactive touch-screen information guide &#150; alternatively, you can approach the fashion corseti&#232;res for advice. Also exclusive to the ION store is Triumph&#146;s premium label, <em>C&#146;est &#199;a</em>, a collection of luxurious lace and elaborate embroidered pieces for that extra sexy oomph.]]></description>

Starters, including ceviche with a tangy twist and crispy calamari, are the real standouts, but mains are equally outstanding. The Make Love Not Raw Burger is a solid offering and a special of succulent prawns grilled to perfection is served alongside gleaming black rice in squid ink. The piece of nori-wrapped salmon is a touch overcooked, but the sides of wasabi mash and mushrooms in white wine and balsamic vinegar make up for it. A chocolate fondant is a little underwhelming, but deep-fried cheesecake balls provide a decadent finish.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[If you&#146;ve got money to burn ($198 per head) and an adventurous palate, dive into the seven-course dinner at Fifty- Three. The use of molecular gastronomy in the cooking is superb and can be tasted from beginning to end. How about this for a menu: start with the crispy chicken skin &#145;chip&#146; with oyster emulsion, move on to pan-seared lobster served alongside apples garlanded with pieces of chopped duck tongue, and finish with chocolate mousse sprinkled with Jerusalem artichoke shavings. You&#146;re left completely satisfied. After signing the enormous bill they surprise you with a gin and tonic &#145;sweet&#146; that dissolves after a minute or two on your tongue into a G&#38;T &#150; at which point you&#146;re finally convinced it was money well spent.

				<description><![CDATA[Conveniently located, but confused as a frog in a sock, Deli-Vege provides a 7-Eleven atmosphere masquerading as urban chic. Sitting gingerly among your new surroundings, enjoy the murals on the wall that offer appetite-suppressing statements about animal&#146;s &#145;pathetic bodies&#146; suffering &#145;electric shocks&#146; while their &#145;families are slaughtered&#146;. We couldn&#146;t help but feel that the decor&#146;s message was preaching to the choir. While the menu offers a wide range, navigating the menu&#146;s layout and grammar was an arduous task. The saving grace was in the food and delicious juices, both of which were fresh and reasonably priced. Sceptics can head straight to the black-pepper &#145;steak&#146; or impressively authentic mock prawns for a hit of guilt-free carcass, while the tempura got a thumbs-up from both judges and the animal kingdom. With better-sized portions than most and a waiter who arrives and departs from your table in eerie silence (okay, terrifying), we&#146;ll be back. Only beware of the spring rolls: they were the only thing left on our plates at the end of the meal.

				<description><![CDATA[If you think a restaurant committed to serving no meat, no seafood, no eggs, no onion, no garlic and no MSG would be a no-go, you&#146;d be wrong. Somehow despite all that&#146;s <em>not </em>used, Na&#239;ve dishes up intense flavours and textures. Much of the magic is accomplished through the copious use of monkey head mushrooms that taste more like meat than vegetables. You&#146;ll find them soaking up flavours such as sweet and sizzling kongpo sauce; braised in an aromatic five-spice broth; or sliced and saut&#233;ed thin and crispy. Of course, tofu makes an appearance, but the plain old curd is transformed into a star with a tangy barbecue baste worthy of a pork rib, or sharp tamarind, lemongrass and chilli sauce. The warm pumpkin and sago soup was a dessert highlight. And the blessing of the sesame seeds (BLOSS) is a surprise you&#146;ll have to ask the helpful staff about.

				<description><![CDATA[A relic of Singapore&#146;s history, the words &#145;Killiney Post Office&#146; conjure up nostalgia and memories of a different era. But today, its glass walls and steel architecture offer a completely different ambience for sophisticated yuppies who desire the combination of history and modern design offered by KPO (named for its location at the junctions of Killiney, Penang and Orchard Road). The two-storey bar feels like a modern home, with comfy sofas strategically placed at the corners, and even a greenhouse on the second floor. There is a balcony where one can watch the traffic whizz by while sipping a martini, and slow ambient beats set the mood for a laidback, louche evening. Drinks are well priced, with decent promotions (Sapporo and Asahi at $7 per bottle). A wider-than-usual bar menu offers great bites &#150; try the barbecue pork ribs for a latenight snack.

				<description><![CDATA[Taking up residence at the old Bukit Timah Fire Station, this gastrobar has set alight a once sleepy part of the island. Making use of the quaint barracks, first built in the &#146;50s, and bordering Bukit Timah Hill, the caf&#233;/bar draws an eclectic blend of local and expat customers. While the mains don&#146;t break any new ground, the sizeable gourmet pizzas and ample selection of tapas, imported beers and cocktails are sure to arouse an appetite in most. Though the young, less experienced wait-staff has yet to find its feet, the Firestation is a decent locale to chow down with the gang before the night really begins to smoulder.

				<description><![CDATA[If you don&#146;t mind smelling like smoky, meaty goodness, this is a great new lunch spot for getting over the Monday blues (or a hangover). We recommend their double patty burgers for that extra juice and the generous helping of thickcut fries; sadly the wasabi mayo is toned down for non-local tastes and doesn&#146;t have the zing we expected, but the place serves beer so you can get your lunchtime pint if you have space left &#150; these burgers are seriously filling.

				<description><![CDATA[Perhaps it&#146;s the rich, cloudy pork bone collagen broth or maybe it&#146;s the plump slices of tender roast pork that attracts an almost permanent lunchtime queue of Japanese families outside this tucked-away ramen hotspot. Either way, they&#146;re hankering for a taste of Santouka&#146;s outstanding <em>Toroniku </em>(roasted pork cheek) ramen in salt, soy sauce, miso and <em>kara-miso </em>(a spicier soybean paste) flavours. As the hottest item on the menu, only 60 portions are available daily. Another item you should not skip out on is a side order of <em>komi tamago</em> (boiled soya flavoured egg), it&#146;s egg-cellent.
<em>Main course $4-$19.50</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This new kid on the block is marketed as a shabu shabu hotspot, but don&#146;t be surprised to find the works on the menu &#150; sashimi, sushi, kushiyaki. Despite the hefty price tag (beef sukiyaki set dinner starts from $60++ and an order of <em>kaisen nabe</em>, seafood and vegetables mixed in a broth, will set you back $50++), Honjin was almost filled to the brim on the Friday night we dined. Yes, the service could do with a polish and the decor may appear worn, but aficionados of Japanese cuisine know to head to this spot when the craving for hotpot with marbled Wagyu beef hits. And did we mention that kids receive complimentary H&#228;agen-Dazs ice cream to end the meal?]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Singapore&#146;s love of Italian fare has proved a double-edged sword. While there are many options to choose from, finding a good one without a $$$$ price tag remains a challenge. Enter Donna Carmela, a neighbourhood eatery that is turning heads and whetting appetites. Run by the same Sicilian family who opened Mamma Lucia, the pasta menu is the size of a novella, and you will need a few visits to do it justice. Hard to resist are the parcels of ravioli, dressed a myriad of ways, and wine from the family&#146;s own vineyards in Verona and Sicily, passionately extolled by manager Simone. For <em>favoloso </em>fare that fills the belly but doesn&#146;t drain the wallet, try dinner at Donna&#146;s.

				<description><![CDATA[On entering, it&#146;s easy to get mesmerised by the brightly lit circular antipasti buffet. The set-up is quite clever: the hostess leads you past the giant wheel of parmesan that&#146;s longing to have a piece shaved onto your plate, and a platter of prosciutto displayed alongside the giant hunk of pig from which it has been recently sliced. Now the real decision had to be made: do we stick with the buffet as our main course, or add on another dish and use the roundabout as an endless appetiser sampler? We went for the latter, and after two dishes piled high with goat&#146;s cheese glazed in honey truffle oil and beef carpaccio sprinkled with rocket and grated parmesan, it didn&#146;t seem possible to ingest anything else. However, when the juicy Wagyu beef arrived, cooked to perfection alongside gnocchi doused in creamy gorgonzola sauce, we obediently made room for more &#150; and left with a fully sated appetite, but absolutely no regrets.
<em><strong>Costs: </strong>Antipasti buffet $28/$35; main courses $23-$48.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Nestled in the back of the Tanjong Pagar Plaza HDB, this tiny takeaway bakery is a gem among the local dry cleaners and coffee shops. A single fluffy muffin is enough for breakfast on the go, but with flavours ranging from cheese to double chocolate to blueberry, you&#146;ll be hard pressed to choose just one. Other sweet treats include chocolate walnut brownies and a hearty strawberry cheesecake. The peach ground-almond fruit flan is a standout, a crisp pie crust full of fruit and a moist, tart-like filling that&#146;s most definitely not your typical gelatinous custard from a can. Take care not to arrive too late in the afternoon, as once they run out of freshly baked goods, they close up shop for the day. Whole flans and cheesecakes have to be ordered at least two days in advance.
&#160;
<em><strong>Costs: </strong>Muffins and desserts: $1.10-$3.50, whole cakes: $16-$30.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The opening of the 120-seater Chinese Box gives residents of the uppity Bukit Timah enclave reasons to cheer, offering semi-refined Chinese fare in a restored black-and-white bungalow that&#146;s set deep in the bucolic confines of the NUS law campus (next to the Botanic Gardens). Points go to the restaurant&#146;s heritage (it was opened by the folks behind Tanglin Road&#146;s The Magic of Chongqing Hot Pot and Suntec City Mall&#146;s Chinese Feasts) and its bright orange and red interior. Though variety from the pan-Chinese menu may not raise many eyebrows, pick wisely, for certain star dishes call for repeat visits. We recommend the golden roast duck, silky smooth congee, trio egg and matrimony-vine in superior stock as well as wok hei-infused garlic fried rice and hor fun. Note that congee and noodles are only available at lunch.

				<description><![CDATA[While the &#145;melting pot&#146; trend &#150; the fusing of distinctive cuisines &#150; became overwhelmingly popular in the &#146;90s, restaurants started to realise this was leading to confusion. Luckily for us, they have taken on more of a &#145;salad bowl&#146; approach here. Each country is represented by separate bowls, some filled with Thai seafood green curry, others overflowing with fish tikka; platters of fresh sashimi are just around the corner from the station, which features a board covered in fine French cheeses. If forced to stick with one section of this buffet for the night, we would skip the trip around the world and dive under the sea. The raw bar is covered in freshly shucked oysters, tender tiger prawns and succulent lobster claws waiting to be cracked. Leave room to sample the vanilla panna cotta topped with raspberry coulis, and the white chocolate mousse and green apple sauce, which both required second helpings.
<em>Dinner buffet $65++. </em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Forgive its location, wedged in the foyer of a boutique hotel and situated on a street full of karaoke bars. The food is fantastic, the wine list well priced, the service warm and attentive, and the ambience perfectly pleasant. The starter of Parma ham with spinach leaves and porcini mushrooms was a perfect example of the simple, rustic fare on offer at Saraceno; the beef carpaccio was similarly delicious with its clean, well-balanced flavours; and the beef cheek braised in red wine, the chef told us, takes him two days to cook &#150; now that&#146;s commitment. A dessert of chocolate fondant with vanilla ice cream made the perfect ending to the meal, with warm chocolate oozing from a surprisingly light sponge. Other touches such as complimentary olives, home-made breads with punchy olive oil and an after-dinner limoncello liqueur just added to the overall experience.

				<description><![CDATA[BooksActually now has a sister named Polymath &#38; Crust that only stocks non-fiction titles. Kenny Leck and Karen Wai describe their latest venture as one that will introduce readers to narrative and theoretical books in the disciplines of philosophy, psychology, anthropology, political science, history, biography, mathematics, science, travel, food, art, photography and film. There is also a tiny tea salon serving the pair&#146;s favourite teas, as well as an exhibition gallery in the attic. For the month of August, the works of photo media artist Jacqueline Felstead will decorate its walls.

				<description><![CDATA[If a sundowner on Sentosa&#146;s Tanjong Beach is what you&#146;re after, and you&#146;re cool with cocktails served up in plastic cups by a grungy and bare-chested (actually, scrap that, nearly nude) barman/DJ, then this is the spot for you. Lo &#38; Behold&#146;s latest drinking hole, The Shack, is a timber-covered shipping container-turned-bar, with a covered pergola, one bench seat and a few old oil barrels for tables. The bar itself is simple and small. The venue is just temporary, holding the place while Lo &#38; Behold builds Sentosa&#146;s next big restaurant- cum-bar behind it, right on KM8&#146;s gravesite. If you&#146;re hungry, there&#146;s a packet of crisps or two to choose from, and don&#146;t forget to show up sporting flip-flops and swimmers. Come prepared with low expectations and you&#146;ll be pleasantly surprised.

				<description><![CDATA[At 1 Caramel, you can have your cake and eat it too. With 27 freshly baked cakes to choose from, you&#146;re bound to find a slice that satisfies your sweet tooth. For tangy, sugary craving, the lemon roulade with light mascarpone cream is recommended; for the tropical fruit lover looking to indulge, a slice of the mango mascarpone cake with a delicious coconut crumble bottom is pure heaven. Shaking things up a little is the densely textured Red Velvet cake with a dark chocolate frosting and the ultra-girly rose mousse and lychee jelly combination; both perfect with a cup of tea. There are a few more concoctions we&#146;re dying to try on our next visit: the impressive-looking dome-shaped Sachertorte, a red miso souffl&#233; and the D&#146;Caramelita, which we hope tastes as yummy as its sensuous sounding name.
<strong>Costs: </strong><em>From $2.50 (mini cupcake), $7.90 (slice of cake)</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Here's what you'll get at Orchard Central:

    &#145;Cluster-concept&#146; shopping divvied up into unimaginatively named sections like The Runway and Indulge, just so you can zone in directly on what seduces you most &#150; whether it is youth-appeal street cult labels, or extravagant, eye-popping timepieces and jewellery along the 140m Discovery Walk that links the mall to Somerset MRT station
    What&#146;s a wall for, if not for climbing? Orchard Central boasts Singapore&#146;s first indoor, five-storey rock-climbing wall
    The Med at basement 2, a complete level that showcases all things Mediterranean-themed, from sharp apparel to spicy slices of pepperoni pizza. Charming Italian men not included
    Speed is of the essence when it comes to snagging best buys. That&#146;s why they&#146;ve installed three superescalators and six express lifts moving between 500 and 2,000ft/min &#150; not that you&#146;ll notice thanks to the cabin pressure. Still, it does bring shoppers to their floor of choice in double-quick time. And with 12 floors to peruse, swooshing devices like these really help bring in the shopping haul.

				<description><![CDATA[Here's what you'll get at ION Orchard:

    ION Sky, a double-storey observation deck on the top two floors of this 56-storey building (sorry folks, the other 48 floors are dedicated to a luxury living complex), allows you to cast your bargain-trained eye along the axis of retail that is Scotts Road, Orchard Road and beyond. This free view will be a welcome respite after eight floors&#146; worth of frenzied shopping (opens in late 2010).
    A &#145;media membrane&#146;, a 117m &#145;skin&#146; that wraps round the complex, will broadcast telecasts of events and shows, while ION2, the largest sheltered area on Orchard Road, will play host to national parties and the all-important weekend roadshow. This is about a lot more than just shopping.
    Art, and lots of it at the 5,300 sq ft ION Art level, where Opera Gallery has been confirmed as a tenant.
    330 shops and restaurants that sell designer brands such as Cartier, Dior, Dolce &#38; Gabbana, Giorgio Armani, Louis Vuitton, and Prada, as well as the dependable staples from Topshop/ Topman, Uniqlo and Zara.

				<description><![CDATA[This boutique bakery lets your choose a cake flavour &#150; Nutella, cinnamon walnut or raspberry chocolate, just to name a few &#150; and match it with your favourite butter-cream icing (say banana, mandarin orange, or even durian). While the number of possible combinations is intimidating, they have a more manageable list of recommended pairings to help you decide. Try the Healthy Bunny (carrot cake with cream-cheese icing), the Nuts About You (Nutella base topped with Nutella cream), or the Peek a Boo (peanut butter brownie cake topped with banana butter cream).

				<description><![CDATA[From the reassuring presence of the tall French ma&#238;tre d&#146; at the entrance to the French-accented English floating through the kitchen&#146;s peek-a-boo service window, Les Artistes got everything right. The bread basket arrived with warm, chewy homemade bread alongside a rich, earthy duck rillette. There&#146;s not much on the regularly changing menu for vegetarians, but that&#146;s the French for you. Why settle for saut&#233;ed greens when you could hoe into beef cheeks that have been braised for five hours? The portions themselves were on the small side and, for a bistro, a little too prettily plated. The upside is that everything was cooked with seasoned aplomb.
The meaty, rosemary-laced rack of lamb arrived with a shot glass of garlicky, truffled pur&#233;e that sparkled with the low crunch of sea salt. The gelatinous beef cheek, stained a deep red by wine, is defenceless against the slight prod of the fork. Even the desserts cleaved close to chef Nicolas Joanny&#146;s less-is-more approach, exemplified by a sweet pear poached and served with a mere scattering of shaved almonds. Simple, but not insultingly so.
<em><strong>Costs: </strong>Dinner set meals from $48 for three courses, $58 for three courses.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Few experiences satisfy the mind and body as thoroughly as a Great British pub, replete with real-ale pumps, chatty landlord, timeworn trinkets and frayed sofas. It was with optimism, then, that we approached The Queen &#38; Mangosteen, a &#145;Gourmet British Pub&#146; whose very name conjures quirky antiquity (Victoria was reputedly a fan of the succulent fruit). Sadly the nostalgic daydream dissipated on first sight. This joint&#146;s all gleaming surfaces, blaring pop and over-zealous air-con, with efficiently blended cocktails and &#145;craft&#146; beers instead of British ales on tap. In other words, despite the smart lounge and anglophile aspirations, this isn&#146;t a traditional pub at all &#150; it&#146;s a slick yuppie gastrobar. Q&#38;M&#146;s (hardly unique) selling point is its waterfront setting, and at night, cruise ships docked outside VivoCity fill you with romantic yearning for far-flung locations. The food is robust, if hardly spectacular. With its adventurous recipes and swish seafront vibe, Q&#38;M has tried hard to marry the demands of a discerning palate to a vibrant semi-alfresco venue, but the end result feels strangely anonymous. &#145;Gourmet&#146; at a stretch, then, but this is about as quintessentially British as a Singapore Sling.

				<description><![CDATA[After taking a trip down memory lane at the Mint Museum of Toys, head up to the rooftop for martinis and beer &#150; a quick reminder of why it&#146;s great to be an adult. While the view is largely obscured by the Swiss&#244;tel, it&#146;s a pretty sight at night when the lights twinkle up and down the tower. This quiet hidey-hole of a bar is adorned with vintage enamel advertising signs, fans from the 1910s and 1930s, and a 1920s counter from a Remittance House along Middle Road turned into a bar. You&#146;ll get one-for-one deals on lychee martinis ($14) and wines ($12), three-for-two deals of gin and tonic ($8), and tequila shots ($8) before 8pm. Dissolve your inhibitions with the Mr Punch cocktail ($14) &#150; a sweet aquamarine mix with a Long Island Tea wallop. But we&#146;re still wondering: where&#146;s Judy, Mr Punch?]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Suburban Spanish fare is something you&#146;d expect to find in the back streets of Barcelona, not a shophouse bordering Bukit Batok. But in just nine months, Don Quijote has become the casa of choice for lovers of Spain&#146;s lip-smacking food and wine. The blink-and-you&#146;ll-miss-it establishment off Jalan Jurong Kechil boasts a bountiful array of delicioso classics, like the sizzling seafood paella Valenciana with its rice in a pan, pinchos morunos (beef on the spit), rollitos de esp&#225;rragos y beicon (asparagus and bacon rolls) and the pastel de chocolate caliente (hot chocolate cake). Complement it all with a glass &#150; or three &#150; of sangria and you&#146;ll be rolling your r&#146;s before the bill arrives.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Housed in a renovated, barn-like building amid the embassies on Tanglin Road, you can sit indoors or on the outside deck with views of the treetops. Black Eames chairs complement the exposed timber floorboards, giving the space a warm, retro vibe. The well-priced menu covers the right bases and although the produce is good, the execution of most dishes is a little too safe, verging on dull. Strange anomalies abound, such as steak frites served with a b&#233;arnaise sauce in a shot glass &#150; a touch impractical, although the steak itself is delicious. Also, a Caesar salad is not a Caesar salad if it&#146;s missing anchovies, no matter how tasty the poached egg and parmesan-coated cos lettuce; try the tastier spiced-lamb kofta salad instead.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[In troubled economic times like these, value-for-money dining concepts go down especially well. Offering over 50 choices for Singapore&#146;s global diner, there are safe options such as fragrant lemongrass pork, tender scallops with spiced butter and sticks of chicken stuffed with creamy ricotta. The more adventurous can pick and choose from succulent prawns with finger-licking good walnut pesto, grilled quail with five-spice powder (not recommended for game-meat virgins) and a surprisingly tasty Mongolian ostrich skewer. Those worried about consuming an all-protein meal can hit up the unlimited salad bar (add on $8), while the dessert bar (add on $6) will fulfil all your sugar cravings.

				<description><![CDATA[It seems as though traditional sushi bars and ramen joints may be getting shoved out of the spotlight by izakayas &#150; pubs featuring savoury snacks that can be downed with sake or cold beer. Tomo Izakaya, a welcome addition to Clarke Quay&#146;s dining scene, is one of the latest examples. The fresh octopus marinated in wasabi sauce packed a delicious punch on its own, as did the stewed pork belly served with spicy Japanese mustard, but when paired with a sochu cocktail both dishes hit a whole new level of splendour. Those who opt to sit by the riverfront will miss out on the warm amber glow created by hanging lanterns and traditional floor seating (with a convenient cutout for your legs) that can be found inside. Solo diners can sit at the bar and chat with the chefs while they sprinkle bonito flakes over the agedashi tofu, grind ginger to be served with the grilled cuttlefish and slice pieces of fresh fish flown in from Tokyo&#146;s Tsukiji Market for the sashimi platters.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Fairy lights festoon the trees flanking the front lawn, while jazz music plays softly, making La Villa ideal for the first date &#150; you&#146;ll have to be playing your cards rather badly if you haven&#146;t got to first base by the time dessert is served. Owned by the Senso group, the menu of expertly prepared Italian cuisine does not disappoint. A starter comprising bufala mozzarella, avocado and ripe tomato delights with its fresh and simple taste. The pappardelle with roasted pork leg ragout and black olives, and the spinach fettuccine with braised duck in red wine, both arrived a smidgen less al dente than we would have liked, but the forktender pork and nuggets of flavourful duck more than made up for this one shortcoming. After drooling over our neighbouring table&#146;s pizza and sizeable platter of grilled prawns, our menu for the following visit was set. And since no romantic meal should end on a savoury note, the apple tart with cinnamon served as the sweet finale to a more than satisfactory meal.

				<description><![CDATA[If you&#146;re cutting back on eating out but need something delicious to munch, La Noce (&#145;The Walnut&#146;) is just what you&#146;re looking for. Set amid a housing estate in Hillview between two Bukits (Timah and Gombak), this off-the-beatentrack boutique eatery serves up home-style Italian favourites with a Sicilian flair. After running busy kitchens both here and abroad, chef/owner Salvatore Catalano adds the personal touch to his flavoursome, albeit small selection of dishes: savour the home-made gnocchi in walnut cream sauce, and the aptly named Salvatore pizza with artichokes and zesty buffalo mozzarella layered on a perfectly crispy crust. With its quaint, personable feel, and a seating capacity of just 40, La Noce is ideal for a catch-up with friends or a quiet romantic twosome.]]></description>

This season, designer Jo Soh&#146;s creations centre on Robot Girl, a &#145;fem-bot chic&#146; collection, all about block shapes and cutesy pieces that can be dressed up for the boardroom. Look for simple shift dresses jazzed up with big bow details, block colours given pizzazz with yellow, red or polka dots and Hansel&#146;s collaboration with accessories brand t43 Jewellery.

				<description><![CDATA[In the very best of Chinese traditions, Chaozhou Inn is a place where you can sit down, order, gossip, eat and be out of the door in an hour. The menu is a tempting mix of the familiar (braised meats and roast pork) and the fabulously esoteric (duck tongue with orange sauce, chilled jellied pig trotters, charcoal-grilled pig&#146;s nape, and pig&#146;s stomach fried with XO sauce). A plate of roast pork and char siew is served unadorned, resplendent in its low-key combination of smoky sweetness. Duck is braised simply in a fermented bean paste and then served, thinly sliced, alongside strips of tofu scented with five-spice powder; the flavours are admirably subtle. Vegetarians also get a look in with treats that extend beyond the usual half-hearted saut&#233;ed vegetables so often seen at other omnivorous restaurants. Paired with the pale-hued vegetarian fried rice, the opulently named Four Treasures was a fragrant blend of gingko nuts, assorted mushrooms and the tart hit of kiam chye. The setting is cosy, the prices affordable, the staff knowledgeable (if a little harried) and, judging by the rapid turnover of customers, it&#146;s a bona fide crowd-pleaser.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[When this local outfit first opened its doors we were unsure how long it would stay open. A local microbrewery, seriously? Months on, it is owner and brewmaster Ernest Ng who is having the last laugh. The bar continues to attract a regular clientele and is even filled on a Tuesday night. While it could be argued that the patrons are attracted to the food and lovely sylvan environment, one cannot argue that point too much when most tables sport a jug or two of the homebrew. The Monster Green Lager&#146;s Hulk-like hue comes from the addition of spirulina and may not suit a classic beer drinker&#146;s palate, so order the hoppy Summer Ale before you reach your final verdict.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[If you are looking to see and be seen, this is most definitely <em>not </em>the place. However, if you just want a spot to shoot some sh*t (or, more specifically, some darts), this may be a new hidden gem. What used to be just one of the many Asian furniture stores, spread all along South Bridge Road, has now been converted into a bar. While many beautiful chests and paintings are still for sale &#150; the owner has a passion she&#146;s not willing to give up &#150; the focus has definitely shifted to the bullseye and cheap booze.
A pitcher of Tiger runs for $18 and is served with sembei and prawn crackers. Show up on a Friday night and they&#146;ll even toss in a free plate of whatever&#146;s cookin&#146;. We scored a bowl of chicken curry that one of the patrons claimed as &#145;the best in Singapore&#146;. The music fits the crowd; they were probably hip in the &#146;80s, but have been layin&#146; low ever since (think &#145;Dancing Queen&#146; and &#145;Money for Nothing&#146;).]]></description>

Look out for the eclectic food this kitchen pumps out, like spicy pupa (honey bees), and fried kimchi with Spam and tofu; but fear not, you will still get your quota of the typical fare as well, such as Korean rice cake and ginseng chicken soup. Standouts are the garlic-sauce-fried chicken, spicy chicken stew and instant noodle soup with a medley of sausage, tofu and vegetables. Drown it all down with their refreshing cucumber and lemon soju.]]></description>

Owner Lim Wei Gien prepares the milky tonkotsu broth every day, allowing flavours to simmer for more than 20 hours. Recommended are the meaty Burger-men and Lum-Lum-men (braised beef in zesty herb sauce). If your taste buds have you wanting something off the menu, requests for specific concoctions can be accommodated. Side dishes are also bountiful: try the piping hot pumpkin korokke (Japanese croquettes) and karashi ebi (prawns garnished with a mouth-gasping mustard mayonnaise).

				<description><![CDATA[If you&#146;re up for eating whale sperm, you might want to dive into the deep end and sample the chef&#146;s surprise menu. The not-so-adventurous eaters will be thrown a lifeboat when they order dishes like the super-fresh maguro and scallop sashimi, and freshly battered tempura prawns that are crisp and juicy to the bite. Highly recommended is the barbecued fugu (puffer fish) and the caramelised barbecued pork with lotus root. With the chefs whipping up spot-on dishes all night, it was strange that an order of simple handrolls could be so disappointingly soggy, bland and small. Otherwise the food was consistently good, although a tad overpriced.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Mr Prata, located near Evans Lodge and a stone&#146;s throw from the Botanic Gardens, churns out prata and rich curries to many a hungry soul in need of a 4am food-fix. The modest alfresco-dining establishment may be lacking comfort, but makes up for it with its diverse menu and brisk service. At the last count, more than 40 prata festooned the menu, complemented by both meat and vegetarian curry dishes from all over India, naan bread from the tandoor, and Singaporecentric fusions (see Mee &#38; Meehoon Mix Goreng). Wash it all down with a manly Milo Godzilla and you&#146;ll be complete &#150; at least till tomorrow, same time, same place.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This truly is a meat-lovers&#146; paradise. Vegetarians, be prepared if you happen to be dragged along by insensitive friends, as the giant skewers of beef wrapped in bacon, glistening sausages and ribs falling off the bone may not sit well. However, the carnivores in the crowd can just sit back and get excited as all sorts of juicy pieces of cow, chicken, lamb and fish are carved onto their plates. Tip: avoid gorging yourself on the hearts of palm, mixed beans and potatoes at the salad bar &#150; this is just their way of filling up your belly before the good stuff arrives. In addition to the parking-lot location and drab setting, there is also something very wrong with the service ethos. The friendly wait-staff festively prepares caipirinhas at the table to complement the all-you-can-eat meats doused in salt, but when they deny diners a glass of tap water it leaves a very dry taste in the mouth. The Brazilian tiramisu sprinkled in coconut helped provide a sweeter flavour to finish the meal.
<em>All-you-can-eat lunch $32++, dinner $39++.</em>

				<description><![CDATA[Pies, fish and chips: with its wall of windows facing the street, the newest bistro serving Aussie food has a warm breeze and friendly staff to complement the informality of its speciality dishes. Named after the glamorous Sydney suburb, the restaurant attracts a cosmopolitan post-work crowd in search of tasty casual fare. Seafood lovers are in for a treat and would do well to start with the tasty tuna carpaccio served with a bushel of alfalfa sprouts. For something heartier, try the large, full-flavoured, blue swimmer crabcake, served with a tart lemon mayonnaise. We were impressed by the fresh flavour of the barramundi, fried in a coriander and sumac batter and served with thick-cut chips and salad. Even though the sticky date pudding was heavier and more gelatinous than golden syrup-soaked sponge, we&#146;ll still return for the all-day Sunday brunch to tackle the molten lava chocolate cake.

Value-for-money happy-hour promotions &#150; two Erdinger pints and an order of buffalo wings for $28++, or one bottle of house wine and a pizza for $38++ &#150; make this venue a great hangout for a quiet evening among friends.

				<description><![CDATA[What magic do they weave with the ramen in the kitchen to make it so bouncy and lush? Each big bowl is already a meal in itself, the earthy broth (there are only three soup options &#150; chicken, spicy chicken or nuts) spiked with either pork balls or boiled pork slices. It&#146;s the connoisseur&#146;s version of Maggi Mee. And if you&#146;re feeling hungry, there are additional toppings to be had, ranging from an almost-coddled egg to omelettes and dominos of soy pork belly braised in soy sauce. Reservations are not taken.

Pair with one of the very reasonable set meals like the tenju (tempura vegetables and prawns), while the Obento set comes with its own yakitori sticks.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[It didn&#146;t take long for news to get out that Patrick Tan had left Shiro, but judging by the quality of a recent lunch at his new digs, he&#146;s not lost his touch. If the budget allows, deliver yourself into Tan&#146;s hands. Depending on the season, he might send out impeccably cut sashimi, Japanese oysters, radish steeped in stock and then inserted between strips of seared beef that fairly melt on the tongue, layers of deep-fried bamboo shoots, and jelly infused with plum wine. And unlike Shiro, Chiharu is defiantly child-friendly.

				<description><![CDATA[A recent visit to Chip Bee Gardens was a nice reminder of how cosy this stretch of Holland Village still is. The &#224; la carte menu here is surprisingly small, with barely three mains. Investigate instead the well-priced set meals where the range is larger and includes a hefty cut of veal wrapped with bacon, and a thick juicy steak on a pile of fries. As good as the mains are, the desserts are strange, such as the strange platter of fruits, and two meringue bricks topped with commercial whipped cream and ice cream. Stick to the lemon sabayon tart.

				<description><![CDATA[Like Cinderella, Wan Hao suffers a little from unwarranted neglect. Its hideaway location doesn&#146;t help, but a recent dim sum lunch proved it was worth the effort to find it. Despite the lack of fatty layer, the burgundy-hued roast pork was still perfectly moist, while standards like the buttery char siew soh and translucent har gao were masterly. Standouts were the scallop sweet soup pooling over snowy rice and pepper-flecked garoupa, and a sesame seed-coated zhin doi stuffed with longan, melted chocolate and whisky that was as unexpected as it was addictive.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Sarang (Korean for &#145;love&#146;) distinguishes itself with a smartly thoughtout menu that doesn&#146;t try to be too esoteric or clever. The musically named mukeunji galbi jjim is a dish of meaty, sweet ribs stewed in a mellow kimchi broth that seems a little lost in the tropics, but which you imagine would go down a treat in snow-swept Seoul. Dwaejigogi bossam is the Korean version of a sang choy bao: thickly cut, sliced and boiled pork is rolled up with lettuce and fresh kimchi, and slathered with chilli sauce and garlic discs; while dolsotbap is a yummy mix of smoky rice and a soybean-sauce stew strewn with straw mushrooms and tofu. Kimchi &#150; the national treasure of cabbage preserved with entire fields of garlic &#150; is featured prominently in just about every dish, so it may help to temper the pungency with the delightful yuja cha, a lightly tart lemon and honey brew.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[If fancy French fare is your thing, Absinthe delivers in spades. The sage-green wallpaper is a subtle nod to the colour of the liquor that lends its name to Our essential guide to Singapore&#146;s best restaurants and bars, old and new &#150; updated every month the restaurant, and the open window to the kitchen offers a glimpse of the bustle behind the scenes. The lively jazz soundtrack provides an upbeat vibe, while candles flickering on each white-clothed table shout romance. The entr&#233;e of foie gras is meltin- your-mouth delicious and the addition of tiny hibiscus flowers gives it a perfect acidic punch. The roasted black cod is also a standout: served on a bed of saffron risotto that is far lighter and less creamy than expected &#150; and more successful as a result &#150; it&#146;s the addition of a dill-scented jus that takes it to another level. A highlight among the skilfully made desserts is the absinthe sorbet accompanying a blueberry cr&#232;me br&#251;l&#233;e. But Absinthe is not just about the food; the restaurant has a charm that justifies the high price tag.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Blame it on the likes of J.Lo and the (some say) oh-so-fabulous Paris Hilton, but the deluxe tracksuit is not going away anytime soon. At the height of its popularity &#150; circa 2004 &#150; these two divas, along with a handful of other comfort-chic loving celebs, drove the cachet of Juicy Couture&#146;s velour and terrycloth creations into the stratosphere. And now, the brand has finally set up shop here.
The walk-in-closet-styled store is imbued with the brand&#146;s desirable Southern California-meets-English countryside style: lipstick-wearing deer heads, Victorian busts with a subtle goth edge, and not forgetting its heritage, a glory wall of tracksuits galore (this season&#146;s favoured shade, yellow) sporting signature JC slogans and icons.
For those not t-suit-inclined, there are sundresses, lingerie, matching mummy-and-me outfits, velour diaper bags, graffiti-style wellingtons (useful for the monsoon season), fun plastic timepieces and charming, erm, charms that open with a flick of the finger. For this spring/summer 2009 collection, there&#146;s a certain Capri breeze blowing through their racks: pretty eyelet peasant tops, cherry prints, graphic block print sheaths, gladiator flats and teeny, tiny shorts. Soon to come, Juicy Couture for Men. We see the queues forming already.

It&#146;s difficult to remember a time before Dempsey Hill became a byword for gastrofab. This moodily lit, high-raftered space has been used to dramatic effect with giant birdcage lamps, a shimmering curtain of glass, soaring filigreed screens, and tall, wing-backed sofas crowded with pillows in Khun Jim&#146;s fabled silks. The tom ka ghai combines the sweetness of coconut with mellow, perfectly cooked chicken strips. The mussaman curry is served with small cubes of beef and potato steeped in a creamy, burgundy sauce of cinnamon, galangal and cardamom. The green chicken curry is warmed by mellow notes of lemongrass, and it is difficult not to inhale the fried kway teow that&#146;s stained black with soy sauce. Dessert should definitely not be skipped, an incomparable tab tim grob &#150; the diced water chestnuts, stained a lipstick red, swimming in a light coconut bath with yellow flashes of jackfruit &#150; and a perfectly judged mound of warm sticky rice to accompany the mango pieces create a grand finale.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[It&#146;s not the city&#146;s smartest bar, and definitely not the coolest. But where the Lizard scores low on hip quotient, its genuinely lovely waitstaff goes to great lengths to foster a family atmosphere, and succeeds. Large screens carry sporting action, but are positioned discreetly so conversation flows as freely as the draft Euro beers (Leffe Blonde, Hoegaarden) and San Miguel. A chillout area and stash of magazines towards the rear makes a comfortable retreat for leisurely (or lazy) lounge lizards; meanwhile pinball machines and a pool table keep restless types occupied. But what really stands out aside from the earthy, genial ambience is the menu. Though this seems an unlikely destination for gastropub gourmets, the bar food isn&#146;t just unfeasibly cheap but of excellent quality.

				<description><![CDATA[You may already be aware that this well-known hotel&#146;s lounge bar offers overpriced glasses of champagne, a menu that lists &#145;mo mixology from around the world&#146; (WTF?) and a caviar &#145;motini&#146; for $1,888 (yes, you&#146;re reading it right). It&#146;s no surprise no one&#146;s ever ordered the rare Russian fish-egg martini, but despite the prices, the bar staff are delightful and there&#146;s a very happy happy hour. Try the Adam&#146;s apple martini, a mouth-tingling, sweet-andsour delight at $20++ (not included on the happy hour menu), or a classic dry martini for $13++. It&#146;s not as cheap as chips, we know; but if you&#146;re there from 6pm, as we were, you&#146;ll also be served a small selection of to-die-for Italian olives and a sample of tapas that will help hold you over after one martini too many.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Helios, Nanos and Chromos are not terms you&#146;d ever link with five-star-fare, but one formula that passes the litmus test is Infuzi, simmering away in the scientific environs of Biopolis. Serving modern European cuisine with a dash of something special, chef Freddie Lee and his team have been quietly perfecting their menu since the restaurant&#146;s inception in 2004. The result is a collection of seasonal, handcrafted dishes that are a joy to behold as well as to indulge in. The pan-fried duck liver with a balsamic reduction, served with roasted pear, may no longer be on the menu and the Maine lobster pasta may be out of season, but the ever-changing menu is sure to replace it with something equally delicious. The wine selection flows freely from the cellar, befitting the restaurant&#146;s European influences; you can also bring your own favourite vintages to the table (corkage applies).]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Got a hankering for a headless beer with uninterrupted views of a construction site? Then take yourself down to One Fullerton where the Lo &#38; Behold Group recently opened this bar-cum-restaurant. With The White Rabbit and Loof as company cousins, this new waterfront spot just along from the Merlion should be something to write home about, but sadly it&#146;s not. Lovely staff it may correctly boast &#150; but work a beer tap or a till they cannot. Based on a 1960s American diner, the interior design is only vaguely retro-funky and the fries from the menu this writer tried were overcooked and overpriced. Having said that, the rest of the menu looks enticing and in line with a theme of eggs. Consider the truffled egg toast for a taste of the exotic, or the pancakes with egg and bacon for something a little off the beaten track. And do pop in for the outdoor seating, evening views of the bay and a reasonably fresh sea breeze.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[It&#146;s beloved of bikers and pool players, but the jury&#146;s still out on BLooiE&#146;s. On our first visit to their Bukit Timah outpost we faced a cold reception in every sense. Deafening rock, air-con so preposterously high it felt like winter in Montreal, brusque service (&#145;Here. Sign it. With the pen,&#146; ordered a waitress) and dire food (an undercooked steak, with carrots so hard they almost broke my fork). On returning, warmth was all around: soft pop music, the wait-staff all smiles and charm, and a perfectly decent Cajun chicken burger. Pick your night to avoid the Roadhouse blues, and you&#146;ll find an enticing menu of high-cholesterol treats in a cosy, roadside-diner ambience: spacious surrounds, moose head and rugby shirts on the wall, well-stocked brickwork bar, TV screens and leafy, out-of-town location. A beery, blokeish bonhomie prevails, so don&#146;t take a date unless you&#146;re a serious ah beng. Botak Jones does this stuff much cheaper, too, but BLooiE&#146;s shades it for style and comfort.
<em>Drinks $10-$18.<br />

His babi assam &#150; tart with tamarind hits and cinnamon &#150; is melt-in-the-mouth heaven, the buah keluak is still black gold, while his new creation Chicken 56 is tender-grilled chook in a thick marinade of cardamom, galangal and cumin. Flip the menu and you&#146;ll find perfectly seared slabs of kurobuta, ribeyes and a crabmeat linguine &#150; dense with al dente pasta, clumps of sweet crustacean and chilli &#150; it&#146;s so good you wonder how a Eurasian learned to cook such good Italian.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[
The best seats in the house are by the balcony overlooking the horses&#146; paddock and training circle. The small menu is imaginative and executed with such panache you have to wonder how long it will be before the chef is poached. Thick, gooey buffalo wings and a firm round of Portobello topped with blue cheese set the stage for the best fish and chips in town. The chocolate cake is blanketed in a velvet chocolate sauce, while the deconstructed strawberry shortcake hums with cream so light it&#146;s practically foam. Everything here shows up the inferiority of the neighbouring Mimolette. ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The name of this mood-lit and rather plush restaurant says it all, really. Hot plates are embedded into the table of each cosy, brown-coloured booth, though if the idea of smoky cooking is not your thing, the kitchen will take over barbecuing duties. The titular chicken soup is warm and herbal-ly (but not so much that it tastes medicinal), while each mouthful of the tofu soup speckled with baby clams and broad beans revives dull spirits. Alternatively, try pairing some sizzling stone-cooked mushroom rice with thick slices of sweet boiled pork.
<em>Main courses $16-$28</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Okonomiyaki is the Japanese answer to murtabaks, but so much prettier. The foundation is eggs, usually two to three per serving. Wafer-thin omelettes wrap around everything from prawns, pork, mochi rice and cheese to soba, clams and cabbage &#150; and sometimes all of those combined. Everything is cooked on sizzling skillets (the choreographed activity behind the glass-fronted kitchen is engrossing), doused with soy, sweet sauces or tomato paste, and then layered with a thick coating of striated mayonnaise before arriving at the table looking like a marzipan torte. Desserts include the gorgeous, marshmallowy greentea mochi and thick red-bean soup.
<em>Main courses $12.80-$13.80.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This rather nondescript outlet draws a fanatically loyal crowd for its desserts. In the spotlight are the cream puffs &#150; little golden buns lightly dusted with icing sugar whose warm delicate shells break open to molten golden custard. These are made in small batches every hour on the hour, but everything is sold out literally within minutes. If you missed the run, kill time at the side cold box stacked with containers of Japanese-style salads like sweet potato and pumpkin, prawns, broccoli mayonnaise, lotus roots and potato.

				<description><![CDATA[Tung Lok&#146;s Andrew Tjioe has always had an uncanny knack for second-guessing the appetite of Singaporeans. His latest venture &#150; a stylish riff on Taiwanese congee &#150; hits all the right notes. Studded with sweet potato chunks and hints of orange, the congee is the ideal foil for the crisply charred oyster omelette streaked with scallion, and snake beans saut&#233;ed with minced mushroom and pork. But the standout of a recent lunch was a tumble of sliced pork, its crackling coating of fermented bean paste yielding to a sweet, meaty centre.]]></description>

The former Caf&#233; Les Amis has been made over, this time with Buko Nero&#146;s Oscar Pasinato on board as consultant. The vibe is homey, comfort Italian chow (like Parma ham with sweet rock melon or a smooth green pea soup with diced prawns) with a sideshow courtesy of the towering wood-fire oven from which emerge rather pedestrian pizzas. The home-made pastas, on the other hand, are terrific, including penne tossed with shredded and braised veal-shank ragu flecked with a mix of garlic, parsley and lemon peel.]]></description>

The quick-fix street-food menu is (for the price) competent and consistent in quality. The thickly gravied laksa with chunks of fish is particularly good, as are the chicken wings stuffed with minced pork dipped in a lemongrass sauce. There are vegetarian options &#150; the tofu curry with rice hits the spot every time. The bright and cheerful red setting and alert service are pluses. ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Surely, its name is uninspired and so is its hawker location. But don&#146;t be sceptical about the quality of freshly prepared pasta and pizza that buddies Max and Melvin whip up as you order. The $6 set meal is great value for intense carb-craving. It comes with an extremely soothing mushroom soup cooked with heaps of garlic bits, a slice of garlic bread and the pasta of your choice. Go for the seafood spaghetti with chilli crab sauce, cleverly pairing the egg, tomato and sauce with pasta instead of the usual Chinese buns, and adding a generous serving of fresh shrimps, clams and fish. The pizza is not spectacular, but do leave room for dessert. The home-made tiramisu doused in rum is light and delicious.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[When a restaurant&#146;s name directly translates as &#145;the grandmother&#146;, you can expect food cooked just like mamma cooks it. But unless you grew up in an Italian home, this may not bring back warm memories of Sunday dinner. Still, home is where the heart is, and La Nonna maintains the homely vibe through nice touches like the &#145;handwritten&#146; (ie, computer-generated handwriting) menu. The rigatoni with tender chunks of braised oxtail was delicious right down to the last drop of sauce, and the beef ravioli in a cream sauce is lifted by liberal amounts of fresh parsley and a truffle compote. The more experimental dishes such as the cream of pumpkin with stingray are iffy; the fishy smell and taste can be a little hard for some to swallow. The risotto, while cooked to the right texture, was disappointing; the foie gras was overdone and the asparagus limp. Our advice? Stick with the more traditional dishes and you&#146;ll do fine.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Make no mistake; Yantra is not just another north Indian restaurant, it is JS Gill&#146;s (of Royal Sporting House fame) chic Indian fine-dining outpost &#150; and it rocks. Should you fail to be impressed by its elegant interior (which looks like a page from Vogue D&#233;cor) and glass-encased open kitchen with four gigantic tandoor ovens, taste the awesome dishes that are being served. Get your palate rolling with kachumber, a refreshing salad of tomatoes, onions and cucumber tossed with an Indian spice-infused lemon juice dressing. It&#146;s worth making a trip just for the anise-scented, sausage-like grilled minced lamb on skewers &#150; mutton seekh kebab, a flavour-packed treat. But if you like it all saucy, the boneless tandoori chicken in a satin-smooth, fenugreek-perfumed broth of tomato butter, murg makhani, is the perfect accompaniment to the crisp and light naan.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Why was six afraid of seven? Because 7-8-9 (okay, old and bad joke, but one that we could not resist). Rest assured though, that there is nothing old about this gem of a tapas-cum-cocktail bar located at The Esplanade&#146;s breezy waterfront. Serving up a range of Latin-or Asian-inspired dishes and delicious concoctions, standouts were the subtly rich udon carbonara and the kurobuta pork belly fajita.
&#160;Epicureans may want to sample the delicate chicken basquaise, cooked slowly at a temperature that would make even Mr Blumenthal blush with pride. To wash all this down, indulge in one of five mojitos &#150; our favourite one was the Batida Mojito made with Sagatiba cacha&#231;a &#150; or the Chilli Zing, a spicy but perfectly balanced vodka tipple. For those looking for a midweek boost, head there Tuesday between 6pm and 8pm for unlimited flutes of Veuve Clicquot, all for $127++. What better way to unwind, or even numb the thought of three more days until the weekend arrives?

				<description><![CDATA[
&#160;
This is the latest addition to the Timbre franchise, known for its laidback vibe and showcase of local bands. While the other two outlets feature livelier music, Timbre @ Old School is home to acoustic sounds. Fittingly, the venue keeps a chilled ambience. Value-for-money happy-hour promotions &#150; two Erdinger pints and an order of buffalo wings for $28++, or one bottle of house wine and a pizza for $38++ &#150; make this venue a great hangout for a quiet evening among friends. If you are looking for an intimate location for a casual date, or just to spend some time listening to fantastic vocals.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Along with the obvious Spanish tapas &#150; olives, salami, calamari &#150; Zsofi gets creative with a ham and cheese croquette that closely resembles a deep-fried grilled cheese sandwich, skewers of asparagus wrapped in crispy bacon, and deviled eggs sprinkled with caviar that bursts in your mouth. This is an excellent addition to Little India&#146;s cosmopolitan restaurant scene, but make sure not to show up starving &#150; we waited 45 minutes for our food to arrive. It pays to order a drink (free food!) and have some patience &#150; it will pay off in the end. 
<em>Free tapas with every drink. </em><em>Tasting platter of six different tapas $14.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Yes, authentic Mexican food is hard to come by in Singapore, but Viva Mexico &#150; part of the recently renovated Cuppage Terrace &#150; comes the closest, starting with a bona fide Mexican chef in the kitchen and ending with a rich pumpkin dessert baked with cinnamon, sugar and cream. Things bode well when free corn chips and two kinds of salsa arrive (literally) seconds after you sit down, with a salsa verde that&#146;s good enough to drink. Though there&#146;s an eclectic side to the menu, stick to the standards, particularly the chicken enchiladas &#150; boneless chicken breast wrapped in soft corn tortillas, with a side of refried beans looking a bit forlorn without a side of rice. Also notable is the depth of the drink menu (another authentic trait if you ask us), which includes more than a dozen kinds of 100 per cent Agave tequila &#150; plus reasonably priced $10 Jose Cuervo shooters &#150; and a delicious, smoothie-style blackberry margarita. Service is top-notch, attentive and knowledgeable; we now know the difference between sangria and sangrita.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The first thing to know about Forlino is you should completely ignore the PR hype about its chic and sexy interiors. Focus instead on the food by Michelin-starred chef Osvaldo Forlino. The excellent vitello tonnato (thin strips of perfectly roasted veal arranged in a pretty flower around a mound of tuna and caper-scented sauce) or handmade tagliatelle, which tangled wondrously with a rag&#249; of duck slivers and foie gras. Desserts, too, were exemplary. The pannacotta trembled deliciously on the edge of liquefied milk; its creaminess was a lush counterpoint to the syrup and flesh of golden figs. And the petits fours (nuggets of pure dark chocolate) deserved their own entry on the main dessert menu.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This caf&#233; is nothing if not charming, with an atmosphere that&#146;s half-baroque salon, half-English shop, and a &#145;trolley&#146; full of bite-sized cookies that a hostess wheels around for sampling. The English tea cookies are pleasantly floury, with no eggs. The bold flavours are sometimes delicious, like lychee and lavender, and sometimes too extreme, like tom yam and nasi lemak, which even in sample-size were overpoweringly spicy. None of these tongue teasers are on the menu, but available to purchase by the tin. Instead, the menu is full of elegant tea cakes and includes an extensive, if pricey, list of teas to pair them with, as well as a smooth vanilla ice cream. The Three Queens cake was moist and rich, flavoured with orange peel and soaked in a potent combination of three liqueurs. It came beautifully presented with whipped cream, mint leaves and fresh fruit &#150; as it should have for $20. <br />
<br />
<em>Desserts $15-$25, cookies $32-$38 per tin.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Tucked away in a shophouse smack in Singapore&#146;s alternative precinct, newcomer Dim Joy promises much in the novelty department, but the differences are largely cosmetic. Hong Kong chef Feng Song Tang&#146;s 15 years of experience show in his standards &#150; his roe-topped siew mai has just the right texture and juiciness, while the century egg porridge is satisfyingly smooth and fairly bursting with flavour. Slightly dry barbecued pork somewhat marred the chee cheong fun and char siew pow; but the custard bun&#146;s rich sweet-salty goodness and Feng&#146;s own durian snow pearl, where he displays a remarkable mastery of the fruit&#146;s pungency, were perfect endings. The open-concept kitchen, airy and naturally lit dining area and non-intrusive bossa nova/jazz score add just the right twist to an otherwise traditional experience. Service is brisk and attentive. <br />

				<description><![CDATA[Australian haunt Boomarang Bistro &#38; Bar begs to be a beer-stained watering hole, with its open-air seating, picnic-style wooden tables and lowback chairs. But thanks to a menu boasting a $90 Wagyu steak and king prawn salad, it&#146;s a casual balance of comfort and class instead.
&#160;
Try the mid-range lunch/dinner menu with a thick Wagyu beef burger topped with beetroot and cooked to our liking, or the tender Angus steak sandwich with barbecue sauce on lightly toasted flatbread. There&#146;s emu, crocodile and kangaroo on the &#145;all-day grazing&#146; list for the more adventurous, and a deep breakfast menu that rivals nearby neighbour Epicurious. Give the desserts a pass &#150; the brownie was dry and hard.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The red wall pads, gold accents, faded timber floors, tables set spaciously apart and ceiling fans create an unusually authentic Thai setting. The menu is fairly standard but done very well. The large and crisp rice crackers are paired with a pork and coconut dip, while the mango salad is a rich blend of dried shrimp, charred salted fish and peanuts. The dark-hued olive rice goes well with a fat butterflied fish wearing a thick, lipstick-red coat of sambal. Yhingthai&#146;s charm, however, comes from discovering the odd gem, like sliced chicken feet salad and fish maw fried with crab meat.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Judging from the tables full of eager diners during our recent Tuesday lunch, you wouldn&#146;t know that PeraMakan is buried in the bowels of a country club. The twin attractions here are the price and the more-than-decent cooking. (Just don&#146;t bring any Peranakan friends &#150; they&#146;re bound to find something to criticise.) There are fatty tiles of pork thick with a coconut satay-like gravy; a more-ish ayam sio gently infused with ginger and coriander; fat sambal prawns; and tender chap chye perfumed with star anise. The desserts aren&#146;t bad: try the inky black and glossy pulot hitam, and the unusually plump apom discs paired with a caramelly banana sauce.

				<description><![CDATA[Don&#146;t worry &#150; this isn&#146;t some seedy pick-up joint. My Type simply serves food specially made for people under each specific blood group. The jury may be out on the medical front, but it still makes for an interesting meal. Besides, the menu is free of processed or GMO ingredients, or trans fat. The &#145;O&#146; meal includes a generously portioned row of sweet ocean trout sashimi on a thicket of rocket, a moist brick of grilled sea bass and a yummy blueberry smoothie. The &#145;A&#146; meal, on the other hand, includes snowy scallop discs, roast chicken and jasmine tea jelly.

				<description><![CDATA[This place is always reliable for decently sized, well-made Italian meals. Highlights include puffy, crusted pizzas topped with favourites like ham, mushroom, artichokes and anchovies, and thick logs of eggplantfilled cannelloni draped with a creamy and fragrant b&#233;chamel sauce. Especially good is a lightly oiled salad layered with thick, fatty cuts of Parma and crunchy cucumber. Much less pleasing is what looks like a complimentary bread basket on the table but &#150; unless you&#146;re alert enough to return it &#150; actually costs $4.50, as well as the restaurant&#146;s stubborn refusal to serve plain tap water.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This restaurant specialises in intense flavours laced with a touch of sweetness. It&#146;s rare to find a place with this calibre of cooking and where dinner for two sets you back barely $50. The fork-tender beef rendang is creamily sweet, the fried fish is golden, and the tahu telor is a smoky, shaggy pile of eggy, crisp tofu. For veggies, the keredok &#150; a small bowl of salad and emping crackers tossed with a tart, spicy peanut dressing &#150; is lovely. Have dessert somewhere else, though; they only have a rather uninspiring buffet of fruits and a couple of coconut-flecked kueh.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Mustard &#150; a key ingredient in Bengali and Punjabi cuisine &#150; makes its presence known in this restaurant&#146;s menu. The maacher cutlet, which tasted like an upmarket version of fish fingers, was nicely breaded and fried, and paired with a warm mustard dip. The small pot of eggplant &#150; gently saut&#233;ed in mustard oil &#150; was delicately paired with <em>luchi</em> (Punjabi puffed bread), while the fluffy mutton biryani was just the thing to soak up the yoghurt sauce of the unusual rose-water scented chicken rezalla curry. The place fills up in the evenings with locals and young travellers from neighbouring hostels, so book ahead.

				<description><![CDATA[It&#146;s amusing to find a terrific French kitchen in a non-airconditioned shophouse in the middle of Little India. Open only for dinner, the place fills up quickly with locals and French expats who want to enjoy their caramel sweet onion soup and fragrant cut of duck p&#226;t&#233;. Nicely oiled lamb chops are perfectly paired with saut&#233;ed herbed potatoes and aubergines, while the richness of the roast duck is cut with a creamy risotto. We found the honey cheesecake too milky and the chocolate cake oddly textured, though. Then again, the diners at the next table practically inhaled their profiteroles.]]></description>

The Chicken Rice Company in bustling Lau Pa Sat, for example, uses chicken that&#146;s reared in a climate-controlled environment and free of growth hormones.The pieces are tender and sweet, though the portions are a little meagre.

				<description><![CDATA[Nothing at Pete&#146;s Place looks like it&#146;s changed in decades &#150; not the familiar red-and-black-checkered tablecloths and napkins, not the brickwork and, in some cases, we suspect, not the waiters either. If the famously well-stocked salad bar doesn&#146;t tempt you, the fettucine bolognaise might; it&#146;s meaty and sweet with carrots, while the thick loops of pappardalle are stirred with mushroom and heady thyme notes. Like the discs of pizza that waft across the room, it&#146;s all a little rough and ready; but that&#146;s part of the nostalgic charm of a restaurant that still fills up, even on weekdays, with a mix of families and solo hotel guests.]]></description>

Corn cooked every which way is the order of the day. Throw in a speedy kitchen and a wait-staff that knows its stuff, and you have a recipe for a rollicking great Friday night. The guacamole is a surprisingly subtle mix of avocado, onions and a hint of lemon. Enchiladas gently fold around a salty-sweet pile of crabmeat, while the DIY hard shelled tacos (piled high with cheese, sour cream and guacamole) help you remember why you&#146;ve always loved finger food.]]></description>

The pair now runs a bijou catering cuisine during the week and takes over Goto&#146;s premises to serve just lunch on Sundays. This is exquisite vegetarian fare served kaiseki style, and the menu changes monthly. Our recent lunch included a silky tofu made of pur&#233;ed sesame seeds, tiny logs of braised eggplant sprinkled with chrysanthemum petals, sweet potato discs in miso soup, and delicate mushroom-flecked potato croquettes.

				<description><![CDATA[The salacious innuendo in this bar&#146;s name is hardly representative of what it really is. Sure, the waitresses are wearing bikinis, but they&#146;re not the skimpy, stringy kind. Plus the girls are more &#145;cute&#146; than &#145;smokin&#146; hot Brazilian goddesses&#146; &#150; they will clearly not tolerate any itchy fingers so anyone hoping to get fresh should forget it. What you can look forward to are sweet deals for Asahi beer (three for $25) and an ample selection of hard liquor, including J&#228;germeister. Food is also served but unfortunately, poor ventilation means you&#146;ll leave the bar smelling like your lunch. One can only hope that some hardbodies coming off the beach find <em>eau de roast duck </em>attractive.]]></description>

Comfort food with unexpected touches is the name of the game here. At the counter, popiah is rolled and kueh pie tee shells are filled. Pork ribs are slathered in a plummy sauce and dotted with white fungus curls, while the tofu is braised with a home-made special sauce. The portions are huge, especially the wonderful chicken soup that includes a quarter-cut wallowing in a clear herbal soup infused with ginseng and red wolfberries.

				<description><![CDATA[You have to love a zhi-char joint that packs so much information into its name. Luckily, this turns out to be an uncharacteristic bout of insecurity, as the cooking is quite masterly. Wok hei infuses the moist fried hor fun: the slippery noodles are bathed in a milky white fish soup; the fluffy rounds of batter-encased tofu are flecked with crunchy chestnuts; and the pork ribs saut&#233;ed with bitter gourd crescents and black bean paste cry out for a bowl of steamed rice. The dishes come in three portions, but the small ones are substantial and can feed four. 
<em>Main courses $9-$18.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The thin apple slices topped with smoked salmon and ricotta are just a sample of what this kitchen has got up its sleeve. Thick, diagonal cuts of veal are encased in a terrific, breadcrumbed shell, and the meat&#146;s sweetness is accented with lemon and sprinkles of coarse sea salt. The pappardelle loops tangled in rich duck ragu are perfumed with sweet carrots and tomatoes. Our mushroom risotto, though heavenly, suffered from the indignity of being finished in five spoonfuls. At $25, the pitiful portion was a puzzling lapse. Don&#146;t have dinner here &#150; it&#146;s like eating in a ghost town. Primetime is morning, lunch and afternoon tea.

				<description><![CDATA[Modern Chinese cuisine &#150; designed to balance technique and presentation while sampling from other sources &#150; can be a difficult tightrope act. Timidity won&#146;t work; a proper hybrid needs wit and a spirit of invention, plus flawless execution.
&#160;
Jing wields the first two confidently, but doesn&#146;t always deliver on the third. Take the appetiser combination of wasabi mayonnaise prawns and Peking duck with foie gras. Jing&#146;s lacquered skin and saut&#233;ed foie gras were a notable improvement on their antecedents, crisp and plush textures harmonising elegantly in the key of duck. However, the so-so prawns were lacking.
&#160;
But brighter moments outnumber lacklustre ones. Morsels of lamb are cushioned on soft radish cake cubes stir-fried with egg &#150; an unexpectedly good combination, as is the perfectly cooked, moist fish fillet baked in a peppery honey sauce. For dessert, lusciously fruity mango pudding didn&#146;t need any of its six garnishes to shine, while a smooth avocado cream dotted with sago achieved the perfect note of sweetness.
&#160;<em>Average lunch $68, dinner $88.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This modern bistro grill opened in late August 2008 at Pan Pacific Orchard (formerly the Meritus Hotel Negara), serving contemporary European cuisine. Although early reviews say it&#146;s pricey, it still worth the visit just to satisfy your craving for Blackmore full-blood Wagyu beef &#150; or free range and organic Kurobuta pork. We know someone, somewhere out there is craving organic pork. <br />

				<description><![CDATA[The Les Amis group&#146;s recent offshoot may not look like much &#150; but it sets precisely the kind of non-threatening mood that draws in the mums and dads. This is jazzed-up local street food with some low-key Japanese/fusion accents (laksa udon, anyone?). The menu is small, and the food is well executed, served quickly and reasonably priced. The Japanese burger (a side bowl of rice instead of a bun) charms with its nutmeggy patty and sunny-side-up egg, while the XO loh shu fun is a generous mound of springy noodles and minced pork. Also good for a mid-afternoon snack is the icy, refreshing lychee jelly dowsed with coconut milk.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This reliable zhi-char joint comes with the added bonus of warm smiles from the bosses, Ah Lek and Ah Hong.

Equally good are the bubbling claypot of liver infused with the intense earthiness of chives and onions; the braised tofu topped with minced pork; and the huge chunk of river fish head perfectly cooked in bean sauce &#150; a steal at $18. When the weather gets warm, head indoors to the air-conditioned building across the courtyard.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Pudong puts paid to that old chestnut about location, location, location. Buried in the drab, echoing bowels of a shopping centre, it&#146;s almost always packed. On weekends, bookings are essential. At first glance you do wonder why, given the surly service and peeling wallpaper, but after the first bite of the lushly fatty, fabulously braised pork that&#146;s accompanied by small hard-boiled eggs, you wonder no more. Then the perfectly cooked noodles arrive, fragrant with nothing more than onion-flavoured oil, and they&#146;re just delicious. This is not refined food, but it&#146;s honest and homey.

The man behind it all is the former master tea blender at celebrated Parisian salon Mariage Fr&#232;res, so its credentials are impeccable. The teas &#150; more than 200 varieties and blends &#150; are the main draw, but the sweets are tempting too. The macarons, in a variety of tea flavours, are delicately wrought, while the cakes are effortlessly refined.<br />

But it&#146;s the &#224; la carte menu that holds some nice surprises (inasmuch as English food can surprise) &#150; among them a generous serving of ni&#231;oise salad with moist French beans, perfectly done eggs and anchovy strips; fat pork sausages served with crisp bacon and a pile of caramelised onions; and a satisfying round of cottage pie. The French fries are addictively good, while the just-right apple pie sets the standard for this town. A live singer entertains with golden oldies from Wednesday to Saturday nights. What more could you want from a restaurant?]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Fashion is clearly enjoying an &#146;80s moment right now with the current obsession with exotic skin accessories. One new entrant is Gina &#38; Jake, an accessories line designed by former Fenwick London accessories buyer Georgina Barber. Crafted from genuine python skin, each vibrant piece comes with the brand&#146;s signature lining, a charming kimono-style peony print. Looks aside, what we love best are the thoughtful touches. The clutch bags come with hidden magnetic fastenings and are ergonomically shaped to fit comfortably under the arm, and the long wallets are soft to the touch and have a zipped coin section plus ample pockets for credit cards. As the old saying goes, beauty is indeed in the details. <br />
<br />
<em>From $40 (luggage tag) to $400 (clutch bag). </em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Much has been made of Tippling Club and its five-, ten- and 15-course dinner menus. What you must know is that every course is a foodand- drink duet, specially tailored to match the other. Consider fat Hokkaido scallops in crisp golden shells of &#145;potato spaghetti&#146;, garnished with basil jelly dice and sweet onion pur&#233;e: alone, it&#146;s merely a pleasant jumble of sugar, starch and umami, but it&#146;s thrown into sharp, delicious relief when washed down with acidic Rocky Valley Riesling. Similarly, braised Wagyu beef is served with horseradish-potato pur&#233;e and wrapped in a transparent beetroot gelatine envelope to match its velvety Malbec counterpart. Whatever you do, don&#146;t even think of driving home if you&#146;re opting for the 15- course menu, although make sure you grab the sachet of &#145;tippling tea&#146;, a morning-after remedy, on departure; it worked like a charm. 
&#160;
<em>Lunch set menus from $29; dinner set menus from $195 with drinks/$125 without.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[
Flamboyant and imposing, Bellini Grande is a supersized version of its predecessor. Rob Collins, Mathilde Ferry and Lucile Bahnholtzer host the night with swing tunes and jazz hits. Backup dancers and a 14-piece band with excellent saxophonists are a big hit with the predominantly chi-chi crowd &#150; although occasionally you&#146;ll spot the odd group of uncouths who see nothing wrong with spitting on the floor.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Shoe fiends alert! There&#146;s a chic new store on Club Street. At Eve, you&#146;ll find Manolo Blahniks standing alongside other pricey imported ladies&#146; footwear labels. Each international brand brings its own character and charm to the heady mix: there&#146;s the Londoner&#146;s choice of art for the feet, Georgina Goodman &#150; ex-OC star Mischa Barton and actress Sienna Miller have been seen pummelling the streets in these famed heels. Hetty Rose, on the other hand (or foot), goes eco-friendly with vintage kimono fabric and recycled leather, while Rupert Sanderson builds his shoe empire on simplicity. Lastly, Finsk is praised highly by Manolo Blahnik himself as &#145;divine&#146;, due to its designs modelled after that of a chair &#150; the heel and sole are the &#145;legs&#146;, and the shoe&#146;s upper is the &#145;seat&#146;. One thing&#146;s for sure &#150; there&#146;s no lack of well-heeled choices for designer-philes.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Singapore has a handful of &#145;Irish&#146; pubs already, but The Toucan ranks alongside Muddy Murphy&#146;s as one of the best (its location in the somewhat seedy Duxton Hill notwithstanding). The look of an archetypal old-school boozer is ably re-created indoors, complete with a cosy lounge area, big-screen TV and pool table. Outdoors, though, is the real draw: here&#146;s a proper pub garden dotted with ample bench seating, plus the occasional barrel, wooden barrow and wishing well. It all sounds terribly tacky but, remarkably, it works. And on a warm Singapore evening &#150; is there any other type? &#150; a pint of Guinness ($11) here is exactly what a thirsty, mildly homesick expat hankers for.
<em>Drinks $9-$35.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This genial joint, tucked away in a food court off Bukit Timah Road, is more than a pub &#150; it&#146;s a one-stop shop. The busy bar fronts three affordable eateries serving northern Indian, Thai-Vietnamese and Western fare. Meanwhile, the 50-50 mix of locals and chilled-out foreigners sups European beer in a landscaped garden complete with a mini-fish pond; the whole enterprise feels like a Goan-style resort bar. The kitchens close way too early, and the bar staff is charmingly amateurish, but with its low bar prices (a pint of Stella Artois is just $7), heavy-drinking patrons and infectious ambience, this is the least Singaporean bar in Singapore.

				<description><![CDATA[In a stretch with such a dense concentration of eateries as Holland Village&#146;s Lorong Mambong, it takes something extra for a place to stand out. In Al Qasr&#146;s favour is Lebanese head chef and owner Ghazi Georges Khanashat. Astonishingly, he uses no salt in his cooking &#150; herbs and spices are cleverly mixed to create flavour; though in the case of the eggplant, garlic and walnut salad, this translated into a rather bland dish. But most flavours are clean and pure, whether it&#146;s the astringent green of rice wrapped in vine leaves, a creamy hummus fragrant with toasted pine nuts, a fresh halloumi cheese salad or the fluffy pita wraps of shredded lamb scented with cloves.
<em>Main courses $10-$25.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Buried among the eclectic Mediterranean menu is a small but rather decent Italian section. The carbonara is a big serving of cream, eggs and pancetta with a choice of pastas. The thin-crust pizzas are kept simple with toppings like tomatoes and anchovies. Avoid the miserlysized, house-cured salmon salad &#150; it&#146;s not worth its $26 price tag. Of course, if the emotional stakes are high and bingeing is required, the adjoining buffet &#150; combining Western roasts and sushi &#150; should do the trick. Yes, it&#146;s hotel cooking, but this is hotel cooking at the InterContinental standard.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Who knew that such a good northern Indian restaurant was squirrelled away in the basement of a Holiday Inn? The ornate, upmarket setting of heavy fabrics and a fountain with a pond sets the scene for first-rate curries and tandoori meats. The flavours are intense, with many items not normally found in local Indian restaurants &#150; like the salty, oddly addictive <em>ka panna</em> drink made of crushed roasted pineapples tinged with cumin and mint, and the buttery naan embossed with dried fruits. The servings are large: our doggy-bagged fried ladies fingers dusted with mango powder, a pile of curried roast potatoes, and baby eggplant braised with tamarind made for perfect snacks the next day.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Sitting pretty right in the heart of Ngee Ann City, the store has been designed to resemble its New York kin. Stella fans can expect to see/buy/paw at this season&#146;s main fashion collection: shoes, bags, sunglasses, accessories and fragrances. Unlike many other designers, her clothes are known to fit curvy silhouettes and her penchant for bright-coloured frocks &#150; like the shocking pink and magenta items currently found in-store &#150; has always been popular with her loyal followers.]]></description>

Located on the third storey of a shophouse along New Bridge Road, this new bookstore would appeal to those who are into Japanese aesthetics (read: it&#146;s cutesy). It also has an online store&#133;but if you&#146;re looking to actually buy books, Casual Poet might be a little too casual.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The small menu has barely changed in years, but why fix what ain&#146;t broke? The warmly lit, dark-timbered space is perfect for a session with the girlfriends or a business meeting. There are daily specials but it&#146;s the standards like a hearty pesto laksa and a stack of seared tofu sandwiching chicken pieces that keep loyal fans coming back. Especially winning is the wall of current fashion, lifestyle and glossy magazines: perfect for sitting alone and sipping a herbal tea while digging into their superb steamed lemon pudding.

Though some of the d&#233;cor is questionable (pink chandeliers?), the starters are reliable and the bar area &#150; with its three-storey waterfall &#150; enjoyable.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[A chic outdoor bar that lets you unwind amid the lush greenery of Dempsey, complete with animal-themed topiary. But don&#146;t let your expectations get too high: the bar staff isn&#146;t quite up to scratch. Service aside, we highly recommend the divine Mini-Mary, a spicy shot that comes with a cherry tomato, and the Gin Fizz, a heavenly mix of gin, lemon juice, syrup, soda water and a dash of egg white.
<em>Main courses $28-$58.</em>

				<description><![CDATA[Amsterdam&#146;s famous restaurant/club has finally opened an outlet in Singapore. If you don&#146;t feel like lounging in white daybeds like some latter-day Roman shtick, you can just observe the drag queens working reception, the sassy gals serving drinks or the people making out in the unisex loo. Better try Dutch chef Ulpho van der Zalm&#146;s smokin&#146; fusion cuisine first &#150; after all, the party only starts after dinner.
<em>There is only one 8pm seating for dinner. 4-course menu (vegetarian option available) </em><em>$65++.&#160;</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Make your way through the usually crowded ground-floor pub and head upstairs to the suede-swathed banquettes and white table linen of The Brasserie. Popular with the Raffles Place suits, this is a great place for eavesdropping (a job interview was taking place at the next table during a recent lunch). The menu deals in modern French brasserie food, with a well-priced, three-course set lunch available for about $40. Particularly well done are the refreshing Waldorf salad (paired with thin slices of perfectly smoked duck) and the thick cuts of tuna steak nuzzling black olives in a pesto sauce.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Chef Ronnie Chia takes the helm at Tatsuya, newly relocated from the Park Hotel, its home of six years. Taking the place of the short-lived Dim Sake Bar, Tatsuya&#146;s small and simple-yet-classic 48-seat dining room boasts both tables and a sushi bar. The melt-in-the-mouth fish is to die for (flown in fresh from the famous Tsukiji fish market in Japan) but you definitely pay for the taste at $100 for a mixed sashimi platter for two. Not everything on the menu comes from under the sea; splash out on a piece of beef sashimi at $20 a pop, or let the chefs do their thing with the traditional Japanese menu at a minimum of $150 per person.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This place fills up quickly during the week with a noisy, exuberant lunch crowd of bankers, secretaries and legal eagles. Reasonably priced set lunches are available; meanwhile, a stern-faced chef behind the counter prepares the pricier sashimi and sushi. The hand-rolls are generously stuffed, and the salmon is gently grilled till the flesh falls off with a gentle prod of the chopsticks. Our favourite offering is the Botan Bento &#150; a huge tray of tempura, sashimi, subtly flavoured braised vegetables, chawanmushi, miso and fruit. A big plus is the brisk service, essential when you&#146;re trying to beat the lunchtime rush.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The name gives the game away, but the Bishan Park setting &#150; in the midst of thick, landscaped greenery &#150; and the vegetarian menu are worth experiencing, especially if you&#146;ve just finished running the dogs. Gluten-free and vegan items are another plus. There&#146;s a bit of everything, from laksas and spring rolls to penne pasta. Highlights include creamy avocado shakes, a huge plate of vegetables paired with a subtle cashew sauce, and a mound of soba studded with meaty chunks of shiitake and shimeji. Particularly good are the tom yam noodles scented with ginger, galangal and garlic. Appropriately, every seat looks out onto greenery.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The tag-line is &#145;Serving Generations with Heartwarming Food since 1981&#146;, and nearly 30 years later, the phrase still applies. Better yet, the large portions are well-priced and everything arrives at the table at a clip, which might explain the high turnover of tables, especially on weekends. Highlights include a pleasantly nutty <em>gado-gado</em> (crunchy vegetable salad), a rich and intensely spicy beef rendang, and a terrific <em>ayam korma</em> (chicken bathed in a sunny, turmeric-hued coconut gravy). The <em>soto ayam</em> (chicken soup) was unbearably salty on a recent visit, though.
<em>Main courses $5.50-$21.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The red booths and dark timber give even the most casual tea here a rather luxe French-style vibe. The best seat in the house is by the window to people-watch, while sipping arguably the best hot chocolate in town. If you&#146;ve just hit the jackpot, splurge on the $450 Iranian oscietra caviar. Otherwise, stick to the excellent Croq&#146; Ferdinand &#150; a slab of toast topped with gruy&#232;re cheese, Parma ham and mornay sauce &#150; and a Nordic platter of wondrously rich and salty-sweet salmon, creamy salmon mousse and thick, fleshy cuts of herring, all served with chives, cream and fat globules of salmon roe. Our eggs Benedict was fatally flawed though by a thoroughly overcooked poached egg.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[For a city so obsessed with food, it&#146;s surprisingly hard to find a decent burger joint besides the obvious: Hard Rock Caf&#233;. The discerning foodie might want to try Wild Rocket&#146;s low-key caf&#233; Relish, tucked away in what appears to be an antique furniture outlet. The menu pairs burgers with fantastic imported beers, from Pink Killer to Sapporo; each ale arrives in its respective brewing company&#146;s distinctive glass, Belgian-style. The pi&#232;ce de r&#233;sistance is the Ram-lee burger &#150; a refined version of Malaysia&#146;s hallowed Ramly burger &#150; complete with neon-orange chilli sauce. Check out the &#145;happy meal&#146;&#150; beer and a burger for $28. <br />
Burgers $17-$19.

				<description><![CDATA[Eastsiders will be thrilled to know that they don&#146;t have to travel to Orchard Road or Holland Village anymore to visit Toni&#38;Guy. Located in a refurbished Peranakan shophouse amid the gastronomical delights of Katong, the East Coast branch officially opened earlier this year. Helmed by directors May Eng and Dawn Soo, you can also catch another popular stylist, director Connee Law, who shuttles between the East Coast and Holland Village salons. In keeping with the neighbourhood&#146;s ambience, the vibe is raw and relaxed, with timber panelling and exposed brick interiors. Aside from offering the usual cut-colour-wash-blow dry services, you can also indulge in the System Professional treatments and colouring services using Wella products on the second floor. Then, head to the room next door for a manicure and pedicure to complete the whole pampering experience. What we love most perhaps is the complimentary pick-up service that&#146;s exclusive to this branch; the salon arrange rides for clients living in the east, even if you&#146;re coming directly from Changi Airport.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[It&#146;s not easy being a jeweller here, what with competition coming from all sides. No wonder Goldheart Jewelry has been leveraging on local star power of late, collaborating with celebrities Eunice Olsen and Lisa Ang, and now forging a partnership with renowned bridalwear designer Ted Wu. The Orient Bliss collections borrow from a number of Asian cultures; the Chinese collection focuses on &#145;flowers in bloom&#146; designs, with dark pink sapphires (from $1,568) that complement Wu&#146;s Chinese-collared gowns perfectly. The Japanese range features purple-gold &#145;sakura&#146; floral motifs in a necklace-and-earrings combination, as well as a belt and pretty hair attachments (from $1,628). Meanwhile the Indian pieces zero in on piercing blue topaz, in the form of white-gold peacock tails (from $1,048). Launched just recently, these original creations will not be sitting on the shelves for long. Word to the wise for all bling-less brides-to-be: head to the nearest Goldheart outlet now.]]></description>

Clockwork beetles (available in three sizes) from Insectlab and Moormann&#146;s mutant chair-cumbookcase piece are a couple of must-see curios, but impulse buyers beware: the bill is going to hurt.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The playful and energetic band interacts well with customers who are busy requesting songs, tipping and bidding for music, or just scribbling notes on the wall. Just like the original Howl at the Moon in the US, the band is highly skilled and plays multiple instruments and nearly every song imaginable. As audiences will always make different requests, each revisit promises a new experience. On the downside, the band likes to perform &#145;I Will Survive&#146; a little too much. Its speciality is a duelling piano challenge. Different drink specials are offered every night. <br />

				<description><![CDATA[Eating at the newly refurbished Royal China is a bit like eating in a giant Tiffany box. Everything from the columns to the ceiling has that distinctive robin&#146;s-egg blue colour. The menu, though, remains as classy as ever. The slivers of roast duck with satiny, crisp skin and tiny bricks of roast pork are marquee attractions, while the dim-sum lunch menu is as good as it gets. Unexpectedly moreish is the bland-looking Hokkien braised rice &#150; every moist grain packs a flavourful punch. It&#146;s not cheap &#150; the Hong Kong kailan is $20 &#150; but if you pick wisely, it&#146;s possible to spend $45 a head and still have an excellent meal.
<em>Average lunch $35 (dim sum); average dinner $70 (four courses).<br />
Main courses $20-$24.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[In a fickle town like Singapore, it means something when a restaurant has been in business since 1953. The home-style cooking here is lush and intensely flavoured. Best of all, prices are extremely reasonable for the portions: an $8 small serving will easily feed two. Among the dishes to try are fried discs of squid, with the evocative taste of smoky belachan, and eggplant braised in soy sauce. Fluffy fooyong is streaked with tiny prawns and crabmeat, while pork strips saut&#233;ed in chilli and assam are the perfect comfort food. For dessert, the chendol, drenched in a white blanket of coconut cream, is unforgettable.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The regular lunch crowd here is dotted with Japanese business suits, so that&#146;s already a reassuring sign that all is well even as you settle down at the narrow chef&#146;s table. The sushi is truly outstanding with fat tuna belly, sweet prawns and firm salmon. If you&#146;re feeling particularly indulgent, the slightly spicy rolls of lurid orange <em>mentaiko</em> (pollock roe) are nutty and delicious. Needless to say, it&#146;s not a cheap joint, but the lunchtime bento boxes featuring a rainbow of sashimi set the bar. <br />

<em>Bento boxes $30-$60.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The &#145;Too&#146; is a reference to Chat Masala&#146;s <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/restaurants/Indian/chat-masala">other outlet</a> on the East Coast; clever that they&#146;re covering both ends of the island. The ochre and rustorange splashes on the wall set the mood for a perfectly cooked meal of curries, crisp naans and pilaffs flecked with fried shallots. And service is brisk. When the bowl of saut&#233;ed lady&#146;s fingers arrives &#150; mildly chilli-hot, and not at all slimy &#150; you know you&#146;re in safe hands, a feeling confirmed as you mop up the creamy and nutty chicken korma, a saffron-tinged fish tikka showered with onion crescents, and a tomato-y curry of prawns and eggplant.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[After all these years, this place still manages to pack them in, especially at the weekend. All this without any fancy decor, though we&#146;re rather fond of the tree-lined views of the bay through the windows that curve along the restaurant. No one seems to mind that a simple dinner for two could set you back $70, but this could be because the Chinese and Malay menu of homey classics is consistently good. We&#146;re fond of the thick logs of fish cakes floating through the creamy laksa, the richly pungent rojak and the fragrant chicken rice.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Though the trek up to the newly minted Helipad bar seems to go on forever, the effort is rewarded with spectacular city views from the rooftop, especially of <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Bars/clarke-quay">Clarke Quay</a> (the bar is directly across the river from the <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/aroundtown/venues/Attractions/g-max-reverse-bungy">G-MAX Reverse Bungy</a>). The stylishly moody interiors (with an oddly placed DJ box right in the middle) ooze a relaxed vibe, while the comfy seats induce long stays. Best of all, friendly staff served up our drinks quickly. We suggest the refreshing Absolut Mango with cranberry juice.<br />

				<description><![CDATA[It&#146;s not often you find a favourite hangout in Bishan that you really want to go to every week. But you&#146;ll strike gold with the Canopy caf&#233;, located within the leafy gardens of Aramsa Spa in Bishan Park. This caf&#233; is open all day, every day, serving a tantalising range of tasty treats. Start the day off with two eggs in any style ($7). Later on, try a classic and giant BLT (bacon, lettuce and tomato) sandwich ($11), or a hearty steak sandwich ($15.50); and then come back at dinnertime for the creamy duck meatballs with fettuccine ($18.50). With the most expensive item on the menu being a lamb fillet at $26.50, we&#146;ll be back here often. The garden setting is truly idyllic and the service refreshingly friendly. Sure beats going into town.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This museum features the most comprehensive collection of Peranakan artefacts in the world, displayed through ten galleries that explore the various facets of this vibrant culture.
<em>Peranakan Museum was also featured in <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/art/feature/strait-out-of-the-past">Straight out of the past</a>.</em>
&#160;
<strong>Things to See</strong>
&#160;
<strong>Conversations Gallery </strong>
As Peranakans re-examine their culture and identity in the face of modernity, this gallery serves as an introduction for the public by showcasing a myriad of Peranakan clothing, food, jewellery and artefacts.
&#160;
<strong>Nonya Gallery </strong>
Domesticity has always been a prominent trait of the Nonyas. The importance of the sarong kebaya, the traditional Nonya attire that&#146;s exhibited in this gallery, will be revealed as it not only highlights the skill involved in beadwork and embroidery, it&#146;s also a preoccupation of the traditional Peranakan woman.

				<description><![CDATA[Verve has moved into the ground floor of the two-storey colonial building that used to house the Turquoise Room. The lush surroundings of Gillman Village that serve as its setting still lure, while the kitchen keeps things low-key with simple Italian bistro fare. Whether done aglio olio-style or tossed with hunks of plump slipper lobster in a white wine-reduced broth, the pastas are crowd-pleasers. The crowning glory, however, is the thin-crust pizza section. Our Barzoni (bacon, mushroom, garlic mascarpone and shredded basil) and Santino (pepperoni, chorizo, baby spinach and jalape&#241;o) were outstanding.
<em>Main courses $24-$36.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The cocktail is king at this speciality bar that says no to bubbly, wine and beer, and a big yes to mixed drinks &#150; especially those made with freshly squeezed fruit juices and premium alcohol. But before you sigh and say, &#145;Not another one of those bars,&#146; consider this: it&#146;s new, fresh and still relatively hipster-free. Housed in what used to be a caretaker&#146;s lodge, this 30-seater boasts works by local artists hanging on the walls and a baby grand piano (complete with singer) parked in a corner. It won&#146;t be long before this upmarket neighbourhood bar becomes the latest spot to see and be seen &#150; so go now.<br />

				<description><![CDATA[What a delightful little bolthole this is, especially in the evening out on the verandah tables. The dual menu is French and Vietnamese and we suspect the pull is the latter option. Especially delightful is the wonderfully named cha ca la vong, a sizzling fried sea bass smothered with a paste of golden turmeric and fresh dill. Pair that with a superb pomelo salad studded with prawns and peanuts, and beef pho drenched in an earthy, rich broth. Gold wallpaper, timber panels and starched linen complete the muted IndoChine vibe, though service can be a little patchy.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The predominantly Japanese clientele is proof enough that this Okinawan joint is the real deal. The menu is flush with options, from grilled meats to gently braised stews. Don&#146;t miss out on the paper spring rolls, packed with the contrasting flavours of tuna and salmon sashimi and the green tang of bitter gourd shards. Other must-have standards: the pork belly, large slices of sweet tender meat braised in soy sauce till the layer of fat melts on the tongue; and grilled beef cubes blanketed with a cloud of grated white radish and a hint of ponzu.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This place is like a Carlsberg commercial. Open the innocuous sliding doors and you suddenly enter a raucous, buzzing world full of yelling chefs, handclapping service staff and customers shouting to be heard above the din. The chefs kneel on three raised timber platforms that catch a trough of fresh seafood, vegetables and meats. Pick what you want and it&#146;s all grilled on the spot before being served on long wooden paddles. Since there is no seasoning or adornment, super-fresh ingredients are key (the grape ice cream is sensational). And it shows in the nightly crowds that sit packed together in rows around the platforms. It&#146;s all highly entertaining.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The all-white interiors &#150; swanky Corian tables and leather finishes &#150; at the Vivocity outlet remind us a little of a sci-fi set, but chef Li Ngai Man lets the cooking make the loudest statement. The menu gathers bestselling items and classics from the other Tung Lok restaurants, so it&#146;s a convenient shorthand for all your favourites. The soups are ambrosial and intensely flavoured with poultry, medicinal ginseng or seafood (yes, there&#146;s shark&#146;s fin and fish maw). Pork ribs, sprinkled with sesame seeds, are braised till fork-tender, though the star attraction must be the handmade noodles fragrantly stir-fried with tiny shreds of duck meat and crunchy bean sprouts.

				<description><![CDATA[Right at the corner of two busy roads, Sum Kee&#146;s homey zhi-char is worth braving the traffic fumes for. We love the har-jeong chicken coated in a crispy batter, and pork strips stir-fried with bitter gourds in a black bean sauce. Sensational too is the fu yu with sweet potato leaves, and the cubes of fried tofu embedded with a thin layer of cereal. Meanwhile, the glistening pork ribs and fried beef noodles never disappoint. The late opening hours are a bonus, especially after a night carousing at nearby clubs and bars. A home delivery service for the River Valley Road area is also available with a minimum order of $20.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The menu here is tiny, but the small number of choices means that the dishes come out quickly &#150; always a boon when you&#146;re rushing to a show. It&#146;s essentially hawker fare, but the odd names take a while to work out. &#145;It&#146;s about to get hotter&#146; turns out to be laksa. &#145;Absolutely decadently yours&#146; is a well-executed <em>chai tau gwai</em> (fried radish cake) loaded with fat prawns, scallops and tender crabmeat. But our money is on the Wagyu hor fun &#150; dark, thick smoky noodles and thin slices of fragrantly saut&#233;ed beef. In the evenings, bookings are not taken, so come by 6.30pm.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The Lee clan has been making sar hor fun since its Ipoh days back in 1948. Tender loops of snow-white noodles are draped in a variety of sauces and toppings and they&#146;re all worth trying, whether it&#146;s prawns, mushrooms and bean sprouts; broiled chicken shreds; or just tangled with globes of wonton. The side dishes are equally good, including golden bricks of fried tofu, and piles of kai lan soaking in thick oyster sauce. Minus point: they charge for tap water.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Newly touted as a &#145;business lounge away from the office&#146;, this year-old lifestyle/F&#38;B site has undergone a major revamp. Thanks to a recent partnership with the Copthorne and Millennium hotel group and JetQuay terminal, Geek Terminal moves beyond emailing and dining to serve as a hub for business travellers. Press the flesh with clients in a space that has rearrangeable soundproofing (sections can be cordoned off for private meetings). Wi-Fi is free (and Cisco-secured) and the latest Panasonic, Eubiq and Canon gadgets are available for you to make presentations. After you&#146;re done, a limousine will whisk you back to your hotel or the airport; you can even check in from Geek Terminal itself. With geekdom coming full circle in the heart of the CBD, it&#146;s certainly still hip to be square.]]></description>

Either way, you can save the environment and jazz up your closet with exclusive pieces from $65 upwards. ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The only multi-label store in South- East Asia to stock choice Brazilian apparel cements its unique position in Singapore with va-va-voom designs from Cavendish, Animale and Victor Dzenk. Girly dresses and blousons by Carla Cavendish complement her namesake label&#146;s Secret Garden collection ($199-$499). Not to be outdone, glamourpusses and adventurous dressers will sashay confidently in Dzenk&#146;s designs. Inspired by the Copacabana Palace Hotel in Rio de Janeiro, dresses are scant, fitted with plunging necklines and noticeably short hemlines ($299- $799). For more casual chic, Animale (pictured) presents a line of denim jeans and sexy, sophisticated tops that look right day or night ($199-$499).&#160;]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Busiest on dry weekends, the ambience of unregulated disarray is an enjoyable antidote to the Lion City&#146;s much-too organised malls. Vintage lovers can expect to trawl for rich pickings. On a typical afternoon, you&#146;ll find rarities like vinyl records, a boxed set of retro Iittala glassware from Scandinavia ($10), and a charming cuckoo clock ($5).]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Despite the relatively upmarket setting at the base of the Singapore Flyer, don&#146;t expect a similar level of service. That aside, the kitchen tries to keep things lively, especially with the simpler dishes. Try the teasmoked duck, nasal-searing wasabi prawns, and superb fried mahogany-hued mantou. The sea bass is perfectly steamed Teochewstyle, lightly tart and gingery; also quite sensational are the lobster chunks drenched in a thick coating of salted egg yolk and then deep-fried &#150; a cholesterol nightmare, but maddeningly delicious nevertheless.

				<description><![CDATA[There is plenty to enthuse about Akashi. The service staff is well informed, while the menu is a comprehensive blend of fresh seafood paired with a satisfying mix of fried meats and soupy noodles. Better yet: orders arrive at a clip, even during busy periods. The smokyscented, fatty tuna belly sushi &#150; both the fresh and seared versions &#150; melts in the mouth like top-grade foie gras. Garlic fried rice dazzles with its heady flavour and golden specks of egg, while a thick side of grilled mackerel, its thin skin lightly charred, astonishes with simple sweetness.

				<description><![CDATA[The interiors aren&#146;t much to look at, but you know the place is serious about its vegetarian menu when you see Buddhist monks tucking into the salads. There&#146;s nothing terribly sophisticated about the offerings (no mock meats, for instance). Instead, dishes are simply flavoured and served up in a flash, though the wait is a little longer during lunch hours. The avocado mousse is smooth as velvet, while the gado gado is served with a terrific, crunchy almond dressing.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[It&#146;s easy to see why loyal customers have followed this charming Thai family-run outfit from its original Farrer Wet Market location: every dish rings with flavour. Sensational are the betel nut leaves wrapped around crisply saut&#233;ed dried prawns, coconut flakes, peanuts and lemongrass shards. Pair a mound of sticky rice with golden-battered tofu and a mild green fish curry spiked with slightly bitter baby eggplants. End the meal with a bowl of not-toosweet, coconut-y red ruby dessert. The place also does a brisk takeaway trade.]]></description>

The two-storey shophouse (private dining rooms are upstairs) is stuffed with Peranakan antiques. The menu introduces some new items like fluffy omelettes with wild pepper leaves. The standards &#150; such as the creamy rendang, lightly spiced banana flower salad, and fragrantly tender chap chye &#150; are superbly done, though a little expensive for the small portions.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Goto Hisao, the former chef to the Japanese ambassador to Singapore, has opened a kaiseki-only restaurant in the space formerly occupied by Wacha. And what a feast he serves up. The line-up depends on what&#146;s fresh at the market. On a recent visit, the basement kitchen sent up astoundingly fresh sashimi; an intriguing clear stew of yam paste, eel and gingko nuts; tempura-ed sweet potato; gently braised octopus and sesame seed tofu; and a trio of desserts that included a sublime cr&#232;me br&#251;l&#233;e made of pumpkin pur&#233;e. The dinner sets are very pricey, but expect premium ingredients like crab and Wagyu beef. Reservations should be made three days in advance and special dietary requests should be made at least one week ahead.
<em>Lunch set $68 (six courses); dinner set $180 (nine courses) or $280 (ten courses).</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[In a country where &#145;blur&#146; is practically a universal trademark, En Japanese distinguishes itself with its alarmingly cheerful and attentive service. And the food is of an equally high standard. There are lots of Okinawan favourites, including succulent pork belly stewed in thick soy sauce with daikon, and bitter gourd sweetly hit with plum. The unagi fried rice &#150; oiled and savoury &#150; is perfectly done, as is the grilled fish head (which has been butterfly-cut, so, reassuringly, doesn&#146;t look like a head). For rainy evenings, sit outside with a huge bowl of shabu-shabu and enjoy the fresh smell of rain.

				<description><![CDATA[The Summer Palace, one of the <em>grandes dames</em> of Singapore Cantonese restaurants, shows no sign of slowing down. The service remains smoothly choreographed, everyone speaks Cantonese and its fried rice &#150; perfumed by wok hei and each grain falling separately &#150; is still the one to beat. Begin the meal with a fragrant pumpkin soup, and pair the fried rice with cubes of seared Wagyu beef or braised vegetables. If you&#146;re throwing political correctness out of the window, the shark&#146;s fin soup is appropriately unctuous and sweet.]]></description>

Fortify the defences with the ginseng and pork soups; then tackle the famed Samsui ginger chicken: tender boiled poultry wrapped in lettuce leaves and doused with a slash of garlic-ginger sauce. The Beggar Bowl tofu (think mapo tofu without the heat and mince), and fried sweet potato leaves are always reliable favourites.]]></description>

				<title>Brewerkz - Bukit Timah</title>
				<link>http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/xmlapi/xml_detail/?venue=1509&amp;key=ffab6a24c60f562ecf705130a36c1d1e</link>

				<description><![CDATA[
&#160;
Mention Brewerkz to any barfly and they&#146;ll think of the flagship gastropub at Riverside Point. The microbrewery also has strategically situated mini-outlets at the Indoor Stadium and Changi&#146;s Terminal Three, and now the company that claims &#147;We do what Werkz&#148; has spread its tentacles further into Singapore&#146;s suburbs with a new opening just off the Bukit Timah Road.&#160;<br />
<br />
On paper it&#146;s a move so logical it&#146;s inspired: the area is known for its predominantly Western population of thir(s)tysomethings with plentiful disposable income. Build it and they will come: a no-brainer, surely? But as the more traditional watering holes Bullfrog and Old Brown Shoe just down the road have already proved, the roadside boozer is not such an easy trick to pull off.&#160;<br />
<br />
For starters, unless you&#146;re a neighbour you&#146;re likely to find parking a nightmare; just combing the back streets for a space leaves you in need a drink. Once there, you&#146;ll struggle to find a USP: rather cheap-looking seating? Check. EPL football on TV? Check. Extortionate bar-food menu? Triple check. And while the wait-staff are nothing if not accommodating, their continual habit of interrupting conversation with refill offers borders on maddening. With its Belgian/speciality brain-numbers and fruity fancies, the diverse Euro-style drinks list at least provides a laudable alternative to the yawn-inducing Heineken and Tiger staples. But a $15 bottle of Maredsous Blond seems scant reward for trekking out to this cramped tavern. Bar-hungry Bukit Timah-ites will likely be left once again with a bitter aftertaste (as I was after trying the Pilsner): BBT is too small to feel significant, too close to the main road to feel much more than a glorified alfresco bar. This afterthought of a micro-microbrewery only &#145;Werkz&#146; if you&#146;re (very) local and less than discerning.

Be sure to call ahead in iffy weather to check if it&#146;s flying regularly.

It has taken over the premises of a former stable with many of the original fixtures, including trademark wooden beams and an ultra-high ceiling.

				<description><![CDATA[Love her or hate her, Hello Kitty is undeniably a part of our pop culture. Drawn into existence in 1974 by Yuko Shimizu, she has left an indelible mark on little girls and grown-ups, and is loved by the likes of Tyra Banks and Paris Hilton. The two-eyed and no-mouth (does anyone else wonder how she speaks?) Hello Kitty has been emblazoned on almost everything &#150; toasters, lunchboxes, laundry hampers, cellphone charms, sticker pads, wallets, handbags&#133;the list goes on. Passionate collectors look out for the &#145;Made in Japan&#146; and &#145;Sanrio Original&#146; stamps before purchasing, which indicate the items was made in Japan and not produced in China, Germany or Hong Kong, where it has a licensing arm. Kitty Love sells both original and licensed products at the store and online. Hard-to-fi nd collectables include the Hello Kitty cellphone ($888), in pink of course, and a Spider guitar ($399) with a huge &#145;Hello Kitty&#146; painted on it in black and pink versions. Take note: these bigticket items need to be ordered ahead of time, but in the mean time there are stationery items, household additions and costume jewellery for sale.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[After almost two years of residency in Raffles City, the shop cart has moved from the first level of the mall to the newly renovated part of the basement, in close proximity to Cocoa Trees and J&#38;Co. What catches the eye immediately is the cutlery with the most adorable cake and pastry adornments. A six-piece set of stainless-steel fondue sticks comes camouflaged as cookie bowls, tomato baskets and party cakes. A mixed berry pie and coloured pastas become handles for cake servers ($16), and chocolate truffles and pralines are memo magnets in disguise ($13-$15).]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[An unassuming little biker bar off Alexander Road, Handle Bar resembles one of those highway stops you often see in American road-trip movies. Given its ramshackle surroundings made out of used motorcycle parts, it&#146;s not surprising that beer &#150; dispensed from contraptions that look like recycled engines &#150; is its clientele&#146;s booze of choice ($24 for a jug of Heineken). And what goes better with beer than spicy chicken wings ($10 for six pieces)? And oh, while you are loading up, get your precious ride a good wash and polish for $30.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Little India isn&#146;t just all about eating dosais, shopping at Mustafa Centre or strolling along Desker Road. Increasingly, quirky, left-of-centre bars are finding their niche within the confines of the refurbished shophouses. One such spot is Domus Caf&#233; &#38; Bar located just off Race Course Road. Its name draws inspiration from the ancient Italian homes that often contain an indoor courtyard, just like this charming spot does, in which rustic benches and tables have been set up in tall bamboo surroundings to help create that &#145;alone in your own world&#146; feeling. Atmosphere aside, Domus boasts a curious concoction you&#146;ve probably never had the pleasure of sampling before: vodka and Yakult cocktails ($12). The bar, which doubles up as a gallery space has a front indoor portion decked out with floral wallpaper and white acrylic seats.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Set up by a coterie of young experimental artists, the vegetarian (and halal, though it&#146;s not Malay) restaurant is named after one of the owner&#146;s art projects and blends equal parts Chez Panisse and Bobo chic. The roasted pumpkin and yellow pepper soup charms with its vivid sunburst colour, while the accompanying slice of fenugreek-scented bread is a perfect counterpoint. The pizzas &#150; we like the crisp wholemeal crust heaped with a pile of wilted spinach, peppers, feta and egg &#150; put to shame just about every other self-styled authentic pizza joint in town. Memorable, too, is a linguine tossed with thick cuts of mushrooms and, of all things, peanut butter.<br />

				<description><![CDATA[It&#146;s impossible not to love a restaurant that&#146;s so defiantly a throwback to an era when baked alaska, tournedo Rossini, paper-crowned chicken kiev and crinkle-cut chips were the height of haute cuisine. And it&#146;s all still on the menu. For sheer nostalgia, insist on the assistance of 77-year-old Uncle Tan, who&#146;s been waiting on tables for 44 years. The famed borscht &#150; thick and oniony &#150; is a must, but skip the mushrooms stuffed with chicken. The theatrics are highlighted by table-side preparations of the eponymous <em>shashliks</em> (a kind of Russian kebab) and the entertaining flamb&#233;ed pancakes. It&#146;s value for money too, with a carpet-bag steak (feeds two) going for $52.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Thank goodness new chef Vincent Teng has jettisoned the previous try-hard menu with its twee names like Silk Stockings and Roll in the Hay. In its place, Teng has imposed the simple, modern flavours he was known for during his My Dining Room days. A cheese tartlet is exactly what it sounds like &#150; crisp pastry filled with a creamy filling. Foie gras is simply pan-fried and delicious for that reason. A highlight is the wonderful kurobuta pork done three ways &#150; thick logs of sausages, braised till fork-tender and breaded cutlet. Downer: inexperienced (if enthusiastic) staff. Our conversation was continually interrupted and we were called &#145;Mister&#146; all evening.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Yes, the French name is misleading; Si Bon is a Japanese joint. This little gem, tucked away in a tiny converted chapel, barely seats ten, and though there&#146;s a sushi counter in the patio outside, ignore it. It&#146;s all about the fabulous kushikatsu &#150; a <em>d&#233;gustation</em>- only menu of deep-fried skewers featuring a variety of finely breaded vegetables and seafood. The combinations are imaginative: cuttlefish and sea urchin, mustard seeds that resemble caviar, tender beef, asparagus spears&#133;The choreography of dishes is finely tuned by the chefs at the counter kitchen, each skewer arriving just as you&#146;ve finished the last one. It&#146;s an expensive meal, but more than justified by the sheer quality of the presentation and ingredients.

				<description><![CDATA[The green-tea theme is carried through to the interior decor of wasabi hues, but it&#146;s all good as you settle in with a range of macha served in an (abbreviated) Japanese tea ceremony. For those with short attention spans, the mint or lychee freezes are quick thirst-quenchers. Food-wise, the menu is limited to items like madeleines, chiffon cakes (a little too dry for our tastes) and a trio of sandwiches, including a wasabi tuna. Order the silky panacotta. Green tea-flavoured, of course.

				<description><![CDATA[Like so many good eateries in this town, the no-frills interiors (fake flowers and hanging plants) provide the setting for fab (and cheap) Indonesian fare. The usual suspects of kangkong sambal, ruby-red chilli eggplant and sayur lodeh are reliable, but be adventurous. An entire log of squid is perfectly grilled in a sweet, black sauce; and it&#146;s hard not to inhale the chicken satay, the thick cuts of meat marinated in an unctuous sauce made of Indonesian palm seeds. In the evenings, sit on the five-foot way and watch the prostitutes ply their trade while chomping on the excellent chendol drizzled with thick gula jawa.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This place incorporates four different menus &#150; Sri Lankan, north Indian, Indian-Chinese and Punjabi. The latter is a fragrant and spicy tour of the subcontinental interiors. Purists will be thrilled to learn the kitchen uses no milk, ghee or lard, nor does it serve beef or pork. There&#146;s plenty to savour including crunchy fritters of onion and chick-pea flour, and fenu greek-scented Koliwada prawns. The lady&#146;s fingers with caramelised onions are a wonder, as are the skewers of seer fish, all golden with turmeric. Mop up the tongue-searing lamb and spinach with some naan stuffed with cottage cheese. Best seats in the house are on the balcony.

Most of the regulars &#150; over three generations &#150; come for the weekend dim sum feast where trolleys of siew mai, braised chicken feet, char siew tarts, roast pork and century egg congee are wheeled around by loud, scowling aunties with hearts of gold. Come early on Sundays (around 10.30am), else be prepared to wait and risk the food going cold by then.
<em>Average per head $10-$15.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Ignore the wince-inducingly gaudy interiors and concentrate instead on the expertly executed Cantonese dishes. Dig into their fried seafood noodles &#150; this dish really shows off the kitchen&#146;s chops. For desserts, the smooth almond cream, and curdlike gwei lin gao are miles ahead of the competition. The dim sum selection is limited but delicately made (try the wondrous steamed carrot cake studded with dried shrimps), so bring the folks for a Sunday brunch.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[A noticeable saloon-esque scent greeted us on first entry to Country Jamboree (we&#146;re still not quite sure if this is a good or bad thing), once inside, one could not help but raise an eyebrow at the top-to-toe cowboy saloon decor. Cowboy hats, soft-porn-style photos of scantily clad glamour models in cowgirl outfits, empty whisky bottles and the odd whip are scattered about; not to mention the fake wooden-log walled room. Cheesy? Oh yes. Particularly amusing was the 10 Indian Commandments poster hidden at the back of the bar. The poster (in all seriousness) proclaimed the following: &#145;Show great respect for your fellow beings&#146;; &#145;Work together for the benefit of all mankind&#146;; &#145;Give assistance and kindness wherever needed&#146;. The irony of these statements was not lost on any one of us. Maybe, just maybe, if we had a few more beers chased down by shots of JD, we too could be &#145;kind&#146; to one of the bar&#146;s portly regulars. Maybe.&#160;Housepour $15, Bottled beer $14.

				<description><![CDATA[Dig into Singapore&#146;s only true kosher restaurant with rich flavours drawn from diverse Middle-Eastern cultures. Still not sure what that means? Well, most of the local Jewish community shares a common Iraqi heritage, so their local cuisine is similar to Indian food sans curry. Like Singaporean culture, food is a central part of Jewish community life as most of their religious holidays revolve around traditional meals and special dishes (like matzo for Passover, or apples and honey for Rosh Hashanah). Enjoy the lavish spread at Awalfi and after your meal, drop by Maghain Aboth Synagogue to check out kosher produce or the Coffee Bean around the corner, which is &#150; yup, you guessed it &#150; totally kosher.

				<description><![CDATA[Established in 1940, this Hainanese stalwart is Singapore&#146;s answer to New York&#146;s Soup Nazi. The elderly gentleman who we think is the owner stands at the counter, watches the room with an eagle eye and barks orders at the matronly staff while running the accounts on an abacus. Choping tables is <em>verboten</em>: apparently he&#146;s been known to kick people out. Several waitresses whispered to us, out of the corner of their mouths, not to wait for our dinner partners, and hurry up and order. As a result, everyone inhales the chicken rice and steam boat. Yes, you&#146;ve had better elsewhere, but there&#146;s nothing like a delicious state of tension to stir the appetite.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Ah, The Ship &#150; still docked (sorry) in its original location and run by the same, seemingly immortal managers and wait-staff. Like its Orchard Road near-neighbour Shashlik, getting to The Ship is like wandering through a labyrinth, but once you get there it&#146;s like stepping back in time. The interior is dimly lit, with candles &#150; good for dates and bad-hair days &#150; and red leather seats. As for eats, it features a standard steakhouse menu and decent service. Avoid adventurous dishes like buttered escargot and go for reliable favourites like steak and baked alaska. Just don&#146;t go down on a Sunday when whole families flock there &#150; mostly the parents&#146; doing &#150; for a little taste of nostalgia.]]></description>

The restaurant reeks of no-nonsense Soviet-era attitude (despite being run by a Hainanese) and cooking, so expect to walk out with food smells clinging to your clothes. The appetisers and desserts aren&#146;t spectacular, but one sweet exception is the Russian staple flamb&#233;d bombe alaska &#150; the fiery relative of baked alaska &#150; Norwegian omelette or glace au four. Lion&#146;s Den features a proper Bombe Alaska doused in dark rum and set ablaze at your table by a skilled waiter. Other than that, cross your fingers, stick to the meats and don&#146;t expect haute cuisine.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[What used to be Top 10, is now Top 5. An institution of Four Floors, the set-up of the club is pure class. Multi-tiered seating options overlook a large stage with a flashing light display spelling out random words. Gone are the Filipino bands doing covers of Top 40 hits, these days, live music entertainment comes in the form of a Taiwanese rock band. Yes, we&#146;re just as perturbed. The establishment attracts the most Asians in the complex, one can only guess they&#146;re gearing up for the influx of mainland clientele expected later in the year when the IRs (Integrated Resorts) throw open their doors.&#160;<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Using only organic vegetables and herbs, Wild Bunch &#38; Co is a unique juice-bar concept that serves 100 per cent organic vegetable juice extracted through pressing yields, a method that involves little or no heat to keep the vital nutrients in vegetables intact and to produce more intense flavours. Aside from the alluring concept, WB&#38;CO is serious about the benefits of drinking vegetable juice, not just because it&#146;s organically produced, but also due to the high levels of nutrients that are not found in fruits, which contain high levels of natural sugar. Vegetables contain nutrients like chlorophyll, not found in fruit, which promotes cell rejuvenation and prevents serious illnesses like cancer. There&#146;s a one-day Home Detox Menu for detox junkies to cleanse their bodies, and a unique juice prescription service for customers on restrictive diets, such as diabetics. Prices range from $1.50 for a shot of carrot juice to $3 for a spinach, carrot and parsley mix; set shots of five ranges from $7 to $12, while a 250ml bottle of juice is priced from $8.60.&#160;

				<description><![CDATA[Vintage India may not be the most evocatively monikered restaurant, but it does boast a very fine kitchen indeed. The menu makes a comprehensive tour of the various cuisines of the subcontinent, starting with the naans and tandoor of the north and sweeping south towards the seafood-based curries of Kerala. Be adventurous and experiment away from the usual orders of tandoori prawns and butter chicken (though the version here was a rich but never cloying blend of thick ochre-hued and gingery gravy with strips of skinless chicken). On a recent visit, the curry leaf-scented Malabar fish curry seduced with snowy-white flesh that melted on the tongue, while a lamb curry warmed with crushed cashew nuts begged for second helpings.

The brainchild of the same people behind hipster-chic Asylum, Frolick serves a low-fat treat topped with fruit, candy and attitude. The storefront is dotted with catchy slogans like, &#145;We stay hard longer&#146; and &#145;I like it topless&#146;. Personally, we&#146;re a fan simply because froyo (as it is more commonly known in the US) is healthier, which means you can eat more&#133;right?]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Always ahead of the curve, the Spa Esprit group has come up with a new multiconcept experience, combining Browhaus, Strip and their new caf&#233;, twelvebytwelve, in one cohesive space at Suntec City. Besides getting various body parts waxed or eyebrows redefined, you can chow down on delicious spa cuisine. The choices include vegan, lowfat, gluten-free and lactose-free options, so all dietary sensitivities are catered to. We recommend the egg-free frittata with sweetcorn, basil and crabmeat, or the hearty parsley-and-bacon broth accom-panied by a poached egg.&#160;]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Chemical exfoliation or pumice scrubs for callused feet? That&#146;s just old news...how about giving the &#145;Doctor Fish&#146; method a go? Curious fish, imported from the highlands of Turkey, specialise in eating dead skin cells and, in the process, &#145;micromassage&#146; your feet. Yuck-factor aside, it&#146;s an all-natural, painless and fun way to pamper yourself. And though the ticklish might shy away from it, it is worth trying for the novelty factor alone. You can also ask about the range of specialised treatments designed to treat skin conditions like psoriasis, dermatitis and eczema. Prices vary.]]></description>

The decor was apparently inspired by Malayan plantations of the 1920's and when you enter you feel like you are walking into a timewarp. Munch on the free nuts and join the clientele (mostly tourists there Slinging it)&#160;in carelessly throwing the shells on the floor.]]></description>

The 40- room business luxury hotel is equipped with some of the niftiest extras any traveller, business or otherwise, could wish for. Aesop toiletries, a Nespresso machine, designer furniture like Poltrona Frau&#146;s Don&#146;do Rocking Chair and the all-important iPod docking station come standard in every room. Personally, we like it for the PS3, Nintendo Wii and X-Box 360 rental service. Let&#146;s face it: which business traveller couldn&#146;t use some quality game time?&#160;<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Steeple&#146;s is as close to the diner frequented by Dagwood in the <em>Blondie</em> comics as you can get. Everyone sits around a cosily lit bar counter, the menu is small, and the staff invariably looks sullen but will sometimes smile if provoked. Everything from the fish and chips, blueberry shake and teriyaki burger to the Caesar salad, fluffy ham and cheese omelette, fudge and brownies are completely in character with the setting. In other words, it&#146;s not a gourmet meal by any stretch of the imagination, but the easy, laidback vibe and value-for-money food keeps you coming back.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Purists may blanch, but with its plain English descriptions of dishes and free of Thai names, Thai Accent&#146;s menu is relatively idiot-proof. What you read is what you get. And it&#146;s mostly good and reasonably priced for the setting (the Andy Warhol-inspired Thai prints are cute), quality and quantity (each main dish is usually enough to share between three). Avoid the fish cakes &#150; they&#146;re oddly rubbery &#150; but do slurp up the huge bowl of beef noodle soup, crunch on the money bags (basically, fried wontons), and pair a bowl of rice with stewed ginger duck, or the spicy bean curd with basil leaves.]]></description>

The caf&#233; is an offshoot of the cooking and baking school next door, so there are lots of cookies and cakes (the cheesecakes are yum, while the chocolate cupcakes are to be avoided) to go with the mainly Asian and Western menu. The low-calorie laksa is surprisingly good, while the chicken-and-sausage baked rice is pure comfort food. The chicken tempeh isn&#146;t great &#150; it&#146;s dry and a little bland. Instead, stick to the chicken salad, a huge serving of leaves, egg, croutons, tomato and sunny raisins.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The austere interiors are a perfect backdrop for Shinryoku&#146;s speciality: luscious yakitori sticks. The flavours of seafood and vegetables unfold beneath smoky top notes; try prawns wrapped in bacon and shiso leaves, and cubes of pork laced with sweet garlic. But the simplest skewers, like the earthy, meaty mushrooms, are the most memorable. The set lunches are particularly good value, especially the $10 tendon &#150; a huge bowl of rice topped with dark gold tempura prawns, fish and vegetables.&#160;<br />
<em>Set lunch $10-$25, yakitori $4-$10.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This place lays claim to being the only restaurant in town serving Kashmiri cuisine. That fact translates into snow-white raita speckled with curd and walnuts, and rich, strongly flavoured curries like rogan josh. The eggplant, perfumed with tamarind, is a delight, as are the mutton curry bathed in a crimson red sauce and chicken marinated with aniseed. A good base is either a pile of crisp garlic naan, or rice slashed with saffron saffron streaks and studded with almonds and cheese cubes. The service tends to be inexperienced, but happily the chef comes out to chat and takes orders, so grab him instead.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Looks are deceptive &#150; the drab ante-chamber with takeaway counter looks just like any other eatery in Little India, while the dining room feels more like a school canteen. The wait-staff lug trays and pails filled with curries and lentil, and happily slop food onto your still-wet banana leaf before you eat it with your fingers. But it tastes just fabulous. From mutton curries and firm river fish fried to a charcoal-black to turmeric-hued chicken curries and sweetbreads, it&#146;s all good and ridiculously cheap. The sweet, frothy chai is the perfect accompaniment. The predominantly Indian clientele is a testament to its success.<br />
<em>Average per head $7.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The Saint Pierre group has teamed up with Sebastien Reullier, of Sebastien&#146;s fame, to create an ambitious combination of bistro, bar and organic <em>&#233;picerie</em>. The restaurant&#146;s name refers to a French weight measure for the amount that a horse can eat &#150; a rather cute reference to its setting on Turf Club Road. On offer is a range of well-executed bistro fare (we&#146;re not sure what pizzas are doing on the menu, though). The <em>vol-au-vent</em> is a velvety mix of mushrooms and creamy mushrooms topped by a small filo parcel; the home-made duck confit is a massive wedge of tender thigh meat; and the airy, fluffy mash accompanying the perfectly seared bricks of salmon steak is wonderful. The rich sticky date pudding is one of the best in town.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[From the hand-painted flowers on the golden walls to the lacquer-red ceiling panelling and glittering curtain chandeliers, the 36-year-old Shang Palace is looking great after its $4 million makeover. Best of all, chef Peter Tsang has updated 80 per cent of the menu &#150; mainly Cantonese with a smattering of Shanghainese and Sichuan. The Peking duck is marvellous while the winter melon soup &#150; a velvety, unctuous, pale green ambrosia streaked with translucent strips of bittergourd &#150; is incomparable. The dim sum menu shows off the kitchen&#146;s considerable chops with a pillow-light char siew bao, and turnip cake with the creamy texture of good pan-fried foie gras.<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Not many bars in Singapore let tone-deaf punters get onstage and sing with the house band &#150; but here, you can sing up to three songs in a row before they drag you off. You can even borrow the band&#146;s guitar or drums and show off your hours of <em>Rock Band</em> training. It&#146;s a KTV addict&#146;s fantasy (or a nightmare for someone with a migraine) and overall, a pretty hysterical way to spend a night out with friends. The bar itself isn&#146;t the most glamorous joint in town, but that&#146;s its charm; you share it with aunties and uncles, wannabe rockers and students. You can also buy a bottle of spirits, tag it, leave it at the bar and enjoy it whenever you come back. <br />

<em>Drinks $12-$15.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Though its location is awkward (tucked away on Penang Road) and the prices steep when it&#146;s not happy hour, this Irish pub is still worth a stop on any pub crawl. Both the d&#233;cor (a 20th-century colonial home made of stone, brick, wood and copper) and service are welcoming; plus, it&#146;s hard to resist having a pint in the cosy courtyard, playing pool or watching a football game on their massive projection screen.

His new digs at the National Museum don&#146;t look like a restaurant so much as a private, residential annex. There are just six tables in all, and the general rule is reservations for a minimum of four. It&#146;s set menus only, and these change weekly &#150; and what treats they are. At our recent lunch, bean-curd slices were saut&#233;ed with star anise, chilli and celery; a huge king prawn bathed in a luxurious broth studded with ginger, red dates and ginseng; while the famed crispy-skinned chicken &#150; soft-fleshed with papery skin &#150; shows a master chef who&#146;s still very much at the top of his game.&#160;<br />

				<description><![CDATA[The name might be impossible to remember a few seconds after you&#146;ve heard it, but the exuberant Thai menu makes a lasting impression. Try the huge betel nut leaf wrapped around pomelo jewels, prawns and shredded coconut. The charred wagyu salad is particularly delicious, as is the luscious, creamy green curry studded with tender snapper and apple eggplants. The Aussie influence of owner Chris Millar is especially evident in the pavlova with brown sugar cream and sweet mango. Bonus: a short, light wine list, with a $9 glass of Kissing Bridge chardonnay. Between courses, investigate the fresh vege stand, range of cakes and muffin, and bottled sauces, like the superb roasted coconut dressing. <em>Main courses $6-$28.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The cheese room at this fab Aussie outpost is quickly becoming a legend in its own time, with around a hundred artisanal farmhouse cheeses from France, Wales and Australia. But it&#146;s the weekend brunches that we like most where, like Sydney&#146;s famed Bills, communal tables make for an informal, collegial outing. The key is the use of great produce. The ciabatta sandwiches stand out, especially the version stuffed with ham, chutney and cheese. The salads are delicious (like the organic roquefort paired with salad, walnuts and rocket) &#150; we just wish the portion was bigger and not the equivalent of a few big mouthfuls.

				<description><![CDATA[The temptation is to order everything on the menu &#150; the portions are, for the price, just right, filling and delicious. The food emerges from the kitchen at a commendable trot, so it&#146;s perfect for that pre-movie bite. Particularly good are the fried tofu, and the salmon salad &#150; a large serving of leaves, pink salmon strips touched with a creamy mayonnaise and, unusually, garlic oil. The pork omelette sits on a mound of shredded cabbage, and it&#146;s impossible to have too many servings of the grilled asparagus wrapped in juicy, glossy bacon. Tip: on weekends, come early or late. Otherwise you&#146;ll have to wait &#150; though rarely for very long.<br />
<em>Main courses $3.80- $12.80.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The queues form early and the tables upstairs are difficult to secure, but it&#146;s all worth the effort. The spicy flavours are intense and vibrant. Seriously impressive is the tender barbecued chicken that is dropped into a sunny, coconut curry sauce, while the towering stack of tahu goreng is sweet, crunchy and peanuty, and the braised brinjal &#150; coated with ruby-red sambal &#150; deserves a plate of rice all to itself. Either show up really early or draw straws in the office for queuing duty.&#160;&#160;]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[You can say this about the Tung Lok Group &#150; it&#146;ll ruthlessly cut off any loss leaders. Blink and its Thai outlet Paddyfields has suddenly given way to a mid-priced Chinese outlet. The menu bears a passing resemblance to Crystal Jade, with dim sum, noodles and yummy xiao cai. The mahjong tiles of roast pork are shatteringly good, while the eggplant clay pot is smoky-flavoured and laced with the sharp tang of salted fish. The yang zhou fried rice is nicely oiled, and an ideal foil for the unctuous dark gloss of the coffee-sauced pork.
&#160;
<em>Zhou's KItchen is also located in Far East Square, Square 2, and <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/shopping/venues/sales-events/jurong-point">Jurong Point</a></em>

				<description><![CDATA[You know things are <em>tr&#232;s </em>authentic when you spot the trio of French owners moving purposely around the narrow space delivering plates of freshly made foie gras <em>tartines</em> (open-faced sandwiches). And this being a French joint, no one will blink if you decide to pair the salads or macaroons with a glass of champagne. On a rainy afternoon, the hot chocolate, served in little stainless steel jugs, is a good way to regroup before facing the hordes in VivoCity.&#160;]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[There&#146;s a mustiness to the place and the decor looks like it hasn&#146;t changed in 30 years, but that hasn&#146;t stopped hordes of regulars from filling the tables every night. This is one of only about two or three Hokkien restaurants in town (discounting hawkers, of course) and, as you would expect, it&#146;s all fairly authentic &#150; from the tiles of fish flavoured with ginger and vinegar to the amazing <em>kong bak</em>, all fatty pork slabs, garlicky and glossy with soy sauce. A favourite is the fried bee hoon, its strands embedded with both fresh and dried prawns. Also try the combination of bamboo shoots, sugar snap peas and shards of fried salted fish.&#160;]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[If you are a cheese lover look no further: chefs Julien Bompard and Edith Lai-Bompard of&#160;the French restaurant Le Saint Julien have opened&#160;La&#160;Fromagerie, 'Singapore's first farm cheese and gourmet concept store' on Mohamed Sultan Road. With over 150 varieties of cheese on offer, it's easy to while away&#160;more time than you'd expected trying to choose what to buy. If you get&#160;overwhelmed by the choice (or smell), enlist the&#160;help of the&#160; very knowledgable staff - they're on hand to guide you,&#160; and for that matter let you taste, anything you are curious about. As well as cheese there are cured meats, fresh bread,&#160;oils and wine to tempt you and your wallet; and if you've got more time, have a seat and enjoy a cheese platter at one of the tables at the back.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The jury&#146;s still out on the name of this joint, but the verdict is in for its food: it&#146;s terrific. Pick your way through a menu filled with organic and gluten-free goodies, herbal drinks and more &#145;normal&#146; fare. The excellent carbonara is streaked with ribbons of parma, while the thin-crust pizza of spicy chicken, feta and roasted capsicums is a cut above the rest. The thick and creamy macadamia nut-and-banana smoothie is easily one of the best drinks in town (perfect with a serving of the crinkle-cut fries). Bonus: extremely lively and attentive service. Weekend brunches are packed with families and pink couples. Breakfast is served till 11am on weekdays but served all day on weekends.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[It seems that there are only two types of wake boarders at Ski 360 - experts getting some serious &#34;air&#34; on the variety of jumps provided or the beginners either being repeatedly pulled face first into the water or managing to stay up for a short time before making the long walk of shame back to the start. There is nothing in between.
It is seriously good fun and, outside peak hours, never overcrowded. The wakeboarding is made possible by a constantly moving wire around the lagoon that propels you out when the ominous (for us beginners) green light comes on.
There are DJs are weekends and a great bar next door for non-boarders to take photos from.]]></description>

But the central attraction here is the small but wondrous Peranakan menu. The items are all fairly standard but cooked with such attention to intense flavours that halfway through the meal, you&#146;re already planning the return visit. The kitchen never takes a wrong step &#150; the thickly gravied beef rendang is fork-tender, the crisp kailan is infused with oyster sauce, while the lushly flavoured <em>babi pongtay</em> (braised pork) is nicely salted and a perfect foil for the mouth-watering sambal.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[On weekends the Tangs household department might take on the air of a pasar malam (night market) but even after 76 years, the brainchild of local retail pioneer CK Tang remains a shopping mecca for tourists and locals alike. Housed in iconic Tang Plaza on Orchard Road, the original department store can be a rather nostalgic place for many Singaporeans and is still fit to boast the Tangs slogan &#145;All The Best Under One Roof&#146;. Both the VivoCity and Orchard locations feature a convenient in-house DHL service, which allows shoppers to mail packages overseas with minimal fuss &#150; perfect for Christmas and birthdays. Don&#146;t forget to take a shopping siesta at the rooftop Island Caf&#233;.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Though Dempsey Road is rapidly becoming hipster central, it still has the feel of a well-kept secret. The Wine Company is a case in point. Tucked away in an old army barracks surrounded by tropical vegetation, it has ambience by the bucketload. The interior is homely, but the open-air courtyard is the best spot. The emphasis is on South African tipple at low, by-the-bottle rates (the bar grew out of a small wine import shop). Offerings on the small changing menu range from cheese platters to steak dinners.]]></description>

If you can&#146;t choose from the 30 on offer ($19-$38), try the lychee version. Sit at the bar overlooking busy Scotts Road, or sink into a sofa.]]></description>

At one end of the spacious outdoor deck, outfitted with Moroccan-style lighting and white vinyl daybeds, sits a mosaic-clad jacuzzi tub. Sure it&#146;s tiny and the water&#146;s cold, but it somehow belongs in a place that sells shots by the half-dozen or dozen and frat-style concoctions like the Graveyard, which contains all the white spirits plus Guinness.<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Divine, an opulent wine bar in Singapore&#146;s Gotham City (aka art-deco business complex Parkview Square), boasts an angel who &#145;flies&#146; up to retrieve your bottle from a 12m-high rack. All silver tutu and fairy wings, the angel/waitress hooks herself into a pulley system, pushes a button and is effectively cranked up and away, floating in a somewhat whimsical search for your pinot noir. (Just ignore the squeak of the machinery &#150; it kills the illusion.) Once she delivers your wine, you can settle into a plush couch or chair and enjoy the live jazz music that serves as the bar&#146;s soundtrack Monday through Friday. Tips: come dressed to impress, avoid looking up the angel&#146;s skirt, and for once, please tip the poor girl.

				<description><![CDATA[There&#146;s competition in this part of town from Screening Room&#146;s alfresco balcony bar, but Breeze more than holds its own. One look at the staff decked out in gauzy Thai-style garb and you know you&#146;re in for a relaxed night at this rooftop terrace at the chic Scarlet Hotel. Settle into a cushy daybed, take in the lush tropical foliage and red-tiled shophouse roofs beyond, and zone out to the jazzy world music soundtrack. You almost won&#146;t need a drink to unwind. We recommend you have one though, particularly the passionfruit martini or cosmolito. Bar bites are also available.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Both the menu and presentation of dishes owe much to Tung Lok but if this is a fault, it&#146;s one shared by most good Chinese restaurants in town. And after all these years, the kitchen is still at the top of its game. Tiles of crackling pork were followed by a dainty square of charred tofu drenched in a lightly salted egg-white based sauce on a pile of wilted spinach. Fat juicy prawns, coated in a creamy wasabi paste, were faultless, while vegetarians will adore the faux goose meat made of dried tofu skin.]]></description>

But the marquee attractions are the passadors, who emerge from the kitchen with metal spikes carrying chicken, beef, pork, sausages, ham and roasted pineapple. Portions are limited only by your appetite.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Hearty, rustic Italian cooking is the draw at La Braceria. Wonderful, thin-crust pizzas with dense, flavourful toppings emerge from the blackened dome of the oven, but best of all are the home-made sausages &#150; fat tubes stuffed with fresh meat, marinated for days in a secret blend of seasonings and spices. It&#146;s very popular and can get pretty squashed on weekends.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The entrance is lovely: a corridor of bamboo stands and stone walls opening on to a bijou courtyard. The latter leads to a pretty dining room, dominated by a long concrete bar, more stonework and a glass curtain shielding diners from the kitchen. The culinary stars are the home-made pastas and garden salads sprinkled with oranges and duck foie gras. Round off the meal with a prosecco in the courtyard.]]></description>

Its two levels are anchored by a glazed kitchen, and shelves are lined with fancy oils, kitchen utensils, gourmet drinks, granolas and chocolates.

The dramatic interiors &#150; cocoon-like, with draped curtains and mood lighting &#150; are worth the effort.

				<description><![CDATA[There&#146;s no lack of Peranakan restaurants in Singapore but the low-profile Dulukala stands out as one of Singapore&#146;s better-kept secrets. Tucked away on the fourth level of the dilapidated Beauty World Centre, this restaurant is quietly gaining a solid following for its no-frills, reasonably priced home-style Peranakan fare. Choosing favourites is near-impossible, but you would do well to keep an eye out for the rich and unctuous ayam buah keluak; banana leaf-wrapped fish otak; beef rendang in a blistering thick coconut-laced gravy; and the bean-paste and garlic-flecked Nonya chap chye.

				<description><![CDATA[One of the best things about eating at a Crystal Jade restaurant (there are branches across the island) is the consistent quality of the food &#150; and this Holland Village outpost is no exception. Nutty, al dente noodles are the perfect foil for assorted dressings of chilli oil, minced pork and tender slabs of braised beef. Best are the xiao long bao, little steamed dumplings filled with pork, hot jus and goodness.]]></description>

In the evening, try to snag a seat on the timber deck facing the road &#150; it&#146;s cooler there. Recommendations include Chomp Chomp Barbecue Food&#146;s grilled stingray (stall 1) and luscious barbecued chicken wings from Daily Fresh (stall 3).]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[If you&#146;ve become addicted to hawker centres while in Singapore, or are ravenous when you arrive, the airport&#146;s food centre is open to the public.

There&#146;s also a food centre in Terminal 1.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Little India&#146;s Bombay Caf&#233;, sitting opposite Mustafa Centre, follows in the footsteps of its East Coast sister. The restaurant makes its presence known with a bright-pink aesthetic and a winning mix of dependable vegetarian offerings. Start with papdi chat, a lively mixture of papdi crisps, chickpeas, sprouts and potatoes, dressed with coriander chutney and cooling yoghurt. Although the deep-fried papdi dough has an oily aftertaste, the combination of crunch, spice and a sweet tang make up for the grease. The pav bhaji dosa is hefty, but a must. Rolled up in paper- thin dosa, this mixture of potatoes and veggies is mashed with masala spice and butter. You can&#146;t go wrong with trusty favourites such as juicy mushroom kurkure stuffed with cheese and spices, then battered and fried to a crispy finish; the gobi manchurian, cauliflower fried until fragrant with chilli, spring onion, ginger, coriander and dried masala; or the aloo angara, marinated potatoes stuffed with crumbly paneer, peanuts and spinach. The dishes are spicy enough to tease your taste buds, but not so much that they will leave your mouth in flames.
<em>Main courses $7-$18.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[For a long time, Les Amis has been a by word for fine French dining. The wine cellar and service remain impressive, though the worn carpeting, glassware, cutlery and faded silver-trimmed show plates could do with a makeover. The menu is still top-notch, though it&#146;s a little more modern (with a splash of Asian) these days. The foie gras is always good, as is the suckling pig with beer sauce. If you happen to be in town during truffle season, splash out here.]]></description>

With the warm lighting, mirrors and handsome timber panelling, this is still, easily, one of the best-looking Chinese restaurants in town.

				<description><![CDATA[If there were awards for restaurants with authentic vibes, this place would get top prize. There is such a feel of old Cairo about the decor that it&#146;s a little disconcerting. With only lazily twirling wall fans, the ground floor can get a little muggy; the upstairs dining room (with an annex room for smoking shishas) is a lot more comfortable, though less atmospheric. The menu does a good job at covering the usual suspects, including a fabulously smooth babaganoush and earthy feta cheese salad. The mezes are a cheap and filling starter for two to three, while the <em>meshawi</em> &#150; a fragrant plate of smoky, grilled meats and vegetables &#150; is another good sharing option.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Among the scores of Indian restaurants in the Little India &#146;hood, Muthu&#146;s is easily the most dressed up. To boot, the kitchen more than holds up its end. The smell of spices hits you the moment you push through the front door. The menu is small (try the creamy butter chicken, and the crispy onion-flecked brinjal) with a very good vegetarian section, but the star attraction is the fish head curry. Even the small serving is a huge bowl of tart pineapple- scented sauce bathing a fleshy whole fish head. The fancy serving island &#150; dotted with hot trays of luridly coloured curries and a hulking tandoor &#150; offers a takeaway option. Bonus: the food comes out fast and furious.
<em>Main courses $8-$20.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Purists tend to turn up their noses at this joint, claiming it&#146;s too touristy. Ignore them. The vibe is lively, the service brisk and the food is well cooked. You can&#146;t ask for more. Granted, the fish head curry is probably better at Muthu&#146;s down the road, but that&#146;s almost splitting hairs; especially when the rust-red mutton masala is delicious, while the creamy richness of the prawn and spinach curry, or the chicken in velvety yoghurt sauce are well-paired with a heap of biryani.
&#160;

Upstairs is a cute, sun-bathed space serving wholesome, delicious vegetarian fare. Offerings include protein shakes; eggs with slow-roasted tomatoes; kapiti blue cheese salads studded with apples and walnuts; roasted vegetable lasagne; and a swathe of wheat/gluten/dairy-free cakes.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Pierside&#146;s subtle makeover is a good reason to drop by One Fullerton again. The place glows like a jewelled box in the evening, while the new timber deck is great for catching a cool breeze. Old favourites are still on the menu, like the gently flavoured miso cod and the light-but-dense crab cake. Rich and satisfying is the thick tangle of sea-scented, buttery cappellini stirred with thin cuts of salt cod and Prosecco cream.

He recently roared back on to the dining scene with Le Papillon. The minimalist decor is clean and bright, and Ho&#146;s touch bold and assured. The seasonal menu includes blocks of chilled watermelon topped with dollops of creamy Meredith goat&#146;s cheese, pesto and pine nuts; and a divine pan-fried filo parcel of braised oxtail and saut&#233;ed mushrooms.]]></description>

Expect to see families and society big-wigs tucking into fat, flash-fried prawns in wasabi sauce, lobsters baked in Carnation milk and shards of fragrant Peking duck nestling on slabs of pan-fried foie gras.

				<description><![CDATA[Packed at lunchtime with suits from neighbouring offices, this hawker centre in the heart of the CBD is set in a lovely, cast-iron Victorian structure, with delicate columns and an octagonal floorplan. It was shipped over from Glasgow in 1894 (by the same company that made the iron for the 1868 Cavenagh Bridge). Try the grilled skate and seafood at stall 43, and a multicoloured ice kachang at one of the many dessert stalls. Alfresco satay stalls appear at night.]]></description>

The modern Canto classics are served in individual portions, all exquisitely prepared. Choose from ribs braised in honey and mocha, tofu drizzled with truffle oil, lobster bathed in citrus cream, and saut&#233;ed beef shot through with black pepper.

				<description><![CDATA[Leave it to an Aussie chef to come up with such imaginative combinations as fig, mozzarella and basil tart or asparagus wrapped in juniper-cured ocean trout. Perched high in the bucolic setting of Fort Canning Park, Christopher Millar&#146;s restaurant is a warm cocoon of timber and comfortable food. The Sunday brunch is especially fun, featuring dim-sum-sized portions of scrambled eggs topped with caviar, shellfish bisque, and little cones of newspapers filled with tiny tiles of fish and fries.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[As befits a restaurant wrapped in the glamorous folds of the ritzy Ritz-Carlton hotel, the Summer Pavilion is a slice of the good life complete with a haute Cantonese menu and interiors by Hirsch Bedner. Reliable favourites include the fragrant fried lobster noodles, Black Angus tenderloin stir-fried with vibrant peppers, and the dim sum. Every so often, the kitchen surprises with a few unexpected touches like fried courgette flowers and foie gras. Service is superb.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[With slick stonework and glass, mood lighting and luxury finishings, this does not feel like your typical Indian restaurant. But the scent of lingering spices &#150; not to mention the tables laden with curries and lassis &#150; gives the game away. The food is delicious, whether it&#146;s fat prawns crimson from the &#8232;tandoor oven; minced lamb kebabs perfumed with cloves; or piles of garlicky and buttery naans. A new menu and renovations were under way at the time of writing.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Greyzone is not as Kylie as it used to be. Formerly known as the Alternative Bar, it underwent a name change in 2006 as the owners tried to lure a mainstream crowd. However, ladies still monopolise the 50-seater, second-storey bar. They don&#146;t seem deterred by the spartan interior, equipped with a pool table (free games on Monday), a TV and&#133; not much else. The owner is a football fanatic, so English Premier League matches are shown every Saturday.]]></description>

Sentosa, which means &#145;peace and tranquility&#146; in Malay, is anything but. Once a fishing village, it served as a British military fortress from the 1800s to 1967 when it was known as Pulau Blakang Mati (&#145;Island of Death from Behind&#146;). In 1968 it began a new lease of life as a holiday resort. Today&#146;s Sentosa is a far cry from its 20th-century counterpart, which was burdened with lame attractions and inadequate facilities. After a $8 billion redevelopment plan rolled out in 2002, the island &#150; covering five square kilometres (two&#8200;square miles) &#150; now has pristine man-made beaches, waterfront eating and drinking outlets, first-class resorts and a raft of attractions. Controlled and manicured it may be &#150; this is Singapore, after all &#150; but it&#146;s a gamble that worked: a record 5.2 million visitors turned up in 2006. <br />
Some think Sentosa is the bee&#146;s knees among Singapore&#146;s sights; others deem it a poor Disneyland wannabe. The best way to tackle the island is to embrace its tackiness along with the decent offerings. There is plenty to see so prepare to spend at least half a day here. Avoid visiting, if you can, at weekends and school and public holidays, when crowds are immense. All visitors must pay a $2 entrance fee. Free buses ply set routes between the major attractions, and trams service the beaches. <br />
A slew of family-friendly attractions are based at the Imbiah Lookout where the cable car station is located. From here you can experience something of the island&#146;s lush greenery on the Dragon Trail Nature Walk, which leads downhill towards two other must-visit attractions: <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/aroundtown/venues/Attractions/underwater-world">Underwater World</a> and <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/aroundtown/venues/Attractions/fort-siloso">Fort Siloso</a>.]]></description>

The place itself is a work of art &#150; angel wings on chairs, creative toilet locks and fun items of decor like multi-coloured, mismatched stools to keep you engaged as you wait for your food.

				<description><![CDATA[Both the femme and homme collections of homegrown label Raoul seem to be on the cutting edge of fashion these days. For ladies, inject some colour into your closet with a piece from its collection of neon and rich jewel-tone skirts, dresses, pants and even trench coats. For the men, slim-cut metallic shirts and casual, cotton-blend one-button suits are all the rage. And while the current trend for floor-length pants (slightly shorter than normal-length jeans; think rolled-up cuffs when wading through water) may not be for everybody, you can skirt round the issue by purchasing a size bigger and tailoring it to fit.]]></description>

Curator and owner Peter Wee &#150; who has been buying, restoring and selling Peranakan-related items since 1971 &#150; has filled his family home with heirlooms: traditional Peranakan crockery, jewellery, beaded slippers, costumes, furniture and photographs of Singapore&#146;s earlier generations of Babas and Bibiks. ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Singapore&#146;s oldest and most popular nature park is a haven for joggers, families and weekend strollers; occasional free concerts are held on Sundays. Popular as it is, facilities are rather run-down and works (due to end March 2008) are under way to provide more user-friendly amenities. To get into the rainforest proper, the MacRitchie Trails around the reservoir offer easy boardwalk treks and ambitious hikes, ranging from 3-11km (1.8-7 miles) in length. Wildlife, from flying lemurs to tree frogs and pangolins, is abundant but rarely seen. Long-tailed macaque monkeys are more common, but be wary: some can be quite ferocious, as they&#146;re used to being fed by irresponsible visitors. A highlight is the <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/aroundtown/venues/Attractions/tree-top-walk-at-macritchie-reservoir">HSBC TreeTop Walk</a>, a suspension bridge positioned 25m (82ft) above the forest floor, which connects the two highest points in the reserve and offers splendid panoramic views. Depending on where you start, the round trip is 7-11km (4.3-7 miles, about 3-5 hours), and graded in parts as &#145;difficult&#146; &#150; so attempt it only if you&#146;re fit and properly equipped. Traffic on the bridge is one-way, so there&#146;s literally no turning back. There are toilets, but bring your own water, food and insect repellent. ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This 1908 Buddhist monastery, Siong Lim Temple, for short, is the oldest in Singapore. An 11-year, $40m restoration project was completed in 2002 (using carpenters and artisans from China), but it still remains a fine specimen of classic Chinese-style architecture. Highlights include the two magnificent 9.1m (30ft) wooden entrance gates and the 29m (95ft) Dragon Light Pagoda built entirely of granite and topped with a golden spire.]]></description>

Intriguing displays include &#145;before&#146; and &#145;after&#146; photographs of all the island&#146;s 24 new towns and housing estates, and a giant pin model showing 50 years of HDB block designs. The Future sector is a let-down, though: the &#145;virtual lift&#146; that leads to the &#145;50th storey skybridge&#146; is extremely dull, as are the gadgets in the e-Home display.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Sentosa&#146;s pioneering aquarium is still a big draw after 15 years in business. New features include an interactive stingray feeding pool, a marine reef display and Singapore&#146;s first &#145;fish reflexology spa&#146; (where Turkish spa fish nibble at the dead skin on visitors&#146; feet in a pool). The highlight is the travellator ride through a 83m (270ft) acrylic tunnel while sharks, rays, eels and schools of fish swim above you. There are feeding sessions, and you can even dive with sharks or a dugong. Admission includes Dolphin Lagoon at Palawan Beach, where pink humpback dolphins perform tricks in the water. Come 2010, Underwater World looks set to be dwarfed by Quest Marine Life Park, part of <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/aroundtown/venues/Attractions/sentosa-island">Sentosa</a>&#146;s new Resorts World and supposedly the world&#146;s largest oceanarium, with 700,000 marine creatures in a huge lagoon.

Skip the downright silly video presentations about Merlion myths on the ground level and proceed straight to the viewing gallery at the top for a breathtaking unobstructed view of Sentosa, the mainland and surrounding islands. At night, there&#146;s a multicoloured laser and musical fountain show (7.40pm, 8.40pm daily) &#150; kitsch, yes, but fun for children. ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Covered by lush rainforest and with landscaped slopes, Mount Faber is a lovely spot, especially at dawn and dusk. Formerly part of Telok Blangah Hill, it was renamed in 1845 after British engineer Captain Charles Edward Faber, who built the narrow winding road that leads to the summit. A joggers&#146; haven, it is also popular with tourists because you can stand next to the Merlion for that quintessential Singapore souvenir shot. Next to the cable car station is the <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/aroundtown/venues/Attractions/jewel-box">Jewel Box</a>, a glass-walled complex of souvenir shops, bars and restaurants, including <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Bars/the-altivo-bar">the Altivo Bar</a>&#160; &#150; one of the best sunset viewing spots in Singapore.]]></description>

That is, until you experience Yeo&#146;s extremely personable approach: making the effort to listen to each client&#146;s needs, he moulds the requested design concept to the last tiny dot. And because the designs are one-of-a-kind, you can be sure no one else will be sporting similar body art at your next big night out.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[It&#146;s certainly taken long enough for the Jermyn Street retailer to make it to Singapore. Known for its classically tailored shirts designed with a contemporary touch, the brand is a favourite among London&#146;s well-heeled yuppies. The store offers collections for both men and women alongside a wide variety of accessories: cufflinks, ties, scarves, boxers and even small leather goods. The Pink Pristine collection deserves a special mention. A Swiss-spun cotton shirt in a water- and stain-proof fabric, it&#146;s a recommended choice for those wine-heavy business dinners. From $259 (shirt), $189 (cufflinks), $199 (ties), $79 (boxer shorts), $19 (accessories).]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Located in the sub-zero bowels of <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/shopping/venues/malls/the-heeren-shops">The Heeren</a>, HMV has been the queen bee of local music retailers since Tower Records closed its last outlet at <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/shopping/venues/malls/suntec-city-mall">Suntec City</a> in 2006. It boasts an impressive selection of music and videos, as well as books, magazines and video games. Nonetheless, this isn&#146;t exactly the place to rediscover your favourite auteur&#146;s <em>Criterion Collection</em> DVD &#150; though you may get a nice (but unlikely) surprise. Vinyl lovers: expect mostly dance records and slightly scary prices. Classical/jazz lovers get to browse in a separate glass room that segregates them from the sweaty <em>American Idol</em>-watching masses.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Named after a Malaccan woman shipping entrepreneur who donated her home to become the site for the mosque. Distinct because of its European style, and for being skewed against the lines of the road grid, the 1846 building was designed by John Turnbull Thomson, an influential colonial civil engineer. Other notable features include the high minaret tower and the stained-glass dome roof, visible from the prayer hall.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[At the start of Serangoon Road, on the corner facing Bukit Timah and the Rochor Canal, stands the perennially popular Tekka Centre. Built in 1981, it replaced the original food market that gave the place its name (tek khia ka is Hokkien for &#145;at the foot of the bamboo&#146;). It&#146;s always been a famous place to buy a vast selection of vegetables, fruit, herbs and, especially, meat. The new complex also houses a hawker centre, while upstairs is a bazaar selling cheap clothes, jewellery, watches and more. ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Little India&#146;s most popular Hindu temple is dedicated to the goddess Kali, often misrepresented in the West as a deity of destruction, but actually a benevolent (if powerful) figure. The building was apparently constructed by Bengali immigrants, and completed in 1881, but like all such monuments in Singapore has gone through many extensions and renovations over the years. The gopuram (tower entrance) is strikingly decorated with multicoloured depictions of numerous Hindu deities, while the main shrine houses a jet black statue of Kali, flanked by her sons Ganesha and Murugam. You can spot those who have been blessed at this temple: they have white ash on their forehead, rather than the usual dark colours.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Founded by a Thai monk in the 1920s, this temple is decorated in a style unlike traditional Buddhist temples elsewhere in Singapore. The first thing you&#146;ll notice are the brightly coloured (and cartoonish) tiger statues that flank the doorway. The interior contains an impressive 15m (50ft) statue of Buddha, illuminated with dozens of lights &#150; hence the building&#146;s other name, Temple of 1,000 Lights. In the back chambers are an image of the elderly reclining Buddha, and a wheel of fortune that you can spin for a small donation. ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This side of Little India was historically the area where the Indian Muslims settled, and the original mosque on this site was founded by Shaik Abdul Gaffoor, a legal clerk in the late 19th century. The current building was a replacement, started in 1907 but not completed until the 1920s. Its architecture is a combination of South Indian, Moorish and Roman styles with a number of unique features such as the sundial in the entrance to the main prayer hall, which is decorated with 25 sunbursts that denote the 25 prophets in calligraphy.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[As you wander around Chinatown, you&#146;ll see many signs for clan associations. But this one, for the Hakka community from eastern Guangdong, is the oldest still-functioning clan building on its original site. It began life as a temple, but gradually took on more functions as a welfare centre, and was rebuilt for that purpose in the late 19th century; later, it was a Chinese school. Inside are historical artefacts and antique furniture imported from China.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" />

				<description><![CDATA[Oddly enough, the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore is smack in the middle of Chinatown. It was built (as a humble shed) in 1827 by Naraina Pillai, the first recorded Indian immigrant to enter colonised Singapore (he travelled with Raffles from Penang). Completed in 1863, it&#146;s famous for its staggeringly detailed gopuram (tower gateway). It is also the site of Theemidhi, a remarkable fire-walking ceremony held a week before the Hindu festival Deepavali, usually in October. If you want to take photos, you have to pay $3 ($6 for video cameras). ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Constructed in 1925 by Hindu Chettiers from South India, who came to Singapore mainly as money-lenders, this temple was intended as a shrine for Vinayagar &#150; another name for Ganesha, the Elephant God. It was frequented by workers from the nearby hospital (which is still there) and prison (which is not). It&#146;s still popular with worshippers at weekends, as is evident from the hundreds of pairs of shoes left in the street.]]></description>

After years of tinkering at home with his beer-making equipment, the self-trained brewer finally took the plunge and opened up his own brewhouse. Before you mistake &#145;home-made&#146; for &#145;substandard&#146;, these brews have been painstakingly formulated and intensively tested. So much so that some patrons have even commented on Red Dot&#146;s superior quality compared to other microbreweries. A &#145;barbie&#146; (barbecue) adjacent to the building is also in the works, as according to Ernest, nothing pairs better with a good, golden brew than some piping hot kebabs.<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Feel like going out-out, but not having to get crushed with the masses? Head to Emerald Hill, where a lane of bars awaits your drinking pleasure. One of them is No. 5, a European-style pub situated in a restored 1910 Peranakan shophouse. You should go early if you want a table for more than four &#150; it&#146;s brimming over with both expats and locals (and the women who love them) longing for a pint after a hard day&#146;s work. The pub serves up a respectable range of classic cocktails, shooters and draft beers. Do ask the waiter what specials they have, as bucket deals (two bottles of Carlsberg or San Miguel for $12) are not unusual. The bar also serves unshelled peanuts to accompany your drinks; don&#146;t shy away from littering the ground with the empty shells &#150; everyone is doing it, and interestingly it adds to the uniquely rustic and unassuming flavour of the place. Whether seated indoors or outdoors, the scene is lively and energetic. And if sitting and sipping isn&#146;t quite entertaining enough for you, there is a busy pool table upstairs where you can rack up, and shoot a ball or two to impress the ladies.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The grand dame of colonial hotels, Raffles needs no introduction. Established in 1887, it still evokes an era when travel and romance went hand in hand, even if droves of tourists now flock here for a Singapore Sling at the <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Bars/the-long-bar">Long Bar</a>. Despite the clich&#233;s, the Raffles legend endures, thanks to its fusion of timeless elegance, classical architecture and tropical gardens. Buildings are linked by cool verandas, and rattan furniture and oriental rugs still dot the rooms. Refurbished in 1991, all 103 rooms are now suites; 12 are named after famous guests such as Rudyard Kipling, Noel Coward and Somerset Maugham. The seven Grand suites are the most nostalgic, with lofty ceilings, polished wooden floors, opulent drapes and balconies overlooking the garden. Among the numerous bars and restaurants are the traditional Raffles Grill and Long Bar Steakhouse, plus Asian offerings at Royal China and <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/restaurants/Eurasian/doc-chengs">Doc Cheng&#146;s</a>.
Have you ever actually tried the Singapore Sling at its historic location? Give it a shot. Or a sip. While you&#146;re there, take a picture of yourself in front of the famous fa&#231;ade &#150; it makes for a great Christmas card/MySpace photo.]]></description>

And as its name suggests, the bar has custom-built ice tanks to ensure your beer (more than 50 kinds) is chilled to the optimum temperature within five to eight minutes. Drinking aside, you&#146;ll lap up the convivial atmosphere; everyone&#146;s seemingly relaxed, without a care in the world. Or perhaps they&#146;re all just satisfied by the famous fried &#145;har cheong&#146; chicken wings. While their choice of music &#150; Top 40 and retro &#150; is questionable, it surprisingly adds to the patrons&#146; good mood; there must be something in those chicken wings.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This compact riverside hotel stands out for two reasons:&#8200;its unconventional, cylindrical shape and affordable prices. Rooms are small and simply decorated with white bedding and soft colours; all come with en suite bathroom and cable TV; many have water views. The small rooftop pool is landscaped with rockery and palms, and there&#146;s also a spa and gym. You can eat and drink alfresco at the Riverside Beach Bar; alternatively, fashionable Robertson Quay is teeming with bars and restaurants.

				<description><![CDATA[Housed in an old, fort-style bungalow, Lloyd&#146;s looks characterful from the outside. The interior is less impressive: rooms are clean and spacious, but bland. The proprietor has not yet mastered the art of exchanging pleasantries, but the place has been going for 16 years; the central location &#150; a short walk from Orchard Road &#150; and low rates must have something to do with it. Booking is advisable; it fills up fast. For an extra $10, you&#146;ll get a fridge (useful, as there&#146;s no room service).

				<description><![CDATA[In a refurbished colonial bungalow just off Orchard Road, SHA Villa boasts an alluring setting. But it is not the lap of luxury. Run by the Singapore Hotel Association, the place is staffed by hospitality students, which is a double-edged sword: the students are eager to please, but service is rough around the edges. With polished wood floors and teak beds, the place has character, but be warned: the standard rooms do not have windows. Breakfast is included.

				<description><![CDATA[Billed as Singapore&#146;s first design hotel, this hip riverside hotspot cuts a striking figure with its postmodern, neon-lit exterior. The stylish rooms fuse minimalism with flamboyance: white bedding dotted with vibrant cushions, for instance, or metal shelving offset by gaudy wall murals. To get a feel for the Singapore arts scene, book yourself into one of the CYX rooms, which have been refurbished by local artists; the in-house photo gallery also reflects the hotel&#146;s edgy spirit. For underwater views of the city, take a swim in the glass-sided pool.

				<description><![CDATA[One of a long string of hotels along Orchard Road, the Orchard has a few distinguishing features: a putting green, a 25m pool and a lifesize poolside chess set. Inside, the aesthetic is East meets West; luxuries include an extensive pillow menu and an IT butler service. For a bird&#146;s-eye view of Orchard Road, ask for an upper floor in the Orchard Wing. Signature Club rooms are sumptous oriental extravaganzas featuring green, red or blue colour schemes, and lots of extras including evening cocktails and a hydro-massage rain shower.

				<description><![CDATA[
&#160;
Following a recent face-lift, the Grand Hyatt has been given the feng shui treatment, from the carefully angled lobby doors to the tranquil water features (including a lavish waterfall). Rooms are decorated in soothing neutral tones with liberal use of blond wood; each has a small patio. The Grand Wing rooms are highly indulgent:&#8200;think goose-down beds, luxury bed linens and Bang &#38; Olufsen entertainment systems. For a garden view, ask for a Cabana room; each comes equipped with a balcony. Other highlights include the free-form swimming pool and deck, the poolside barbecue (on weekends only) and the classy cocktails served up at the Martini Bar.

				<description><![CDATA[Though located at the end of Robertson Quay, this riverside hotel is more suited to corporate travellers than tourists. In addition to a business centre, there are 25 fully furnished offices and a complimentary shuttle bus service to the CBD (and Orchard Road). Many of the rooms have gorgeous views over the river. For a scenic jog, guests can run along the riverbank or in nearby Kim Seng Park. Night owls can whoop it up next door at mega dance club Zouk. The downside? The swimming pool is tiny for such a big hotel.

				<description><![CDATA[A short walk from Chinatown and Clarke Quay, this four-star property is well sited, but is looking rather tired these days. Still, the good-sized swimming pool, landscaped grounds and extensive buffet breakfast are a draw, and there&#146;s wireless broadband in all rooms. Service is decent, and the bellboys, many of whom have been working here for over 30 years, are well informed &#150; the hotel is right next to the neon-lit Tiananmen KTV (a notorious &#145;entertainment&#146; spot), so you can be sure they&#146;ll have plenty of interesting stories to tell. The Waterfall Lounge is a soothing place for a drink. Practise your backhand on the tennis court and ease your muscles afterwards in the Jacuzzi.

				<description><![CDATA[With a prime position on the corner of Orchard and Scotts Roads, and a green-roofed, pagoda-style tower, the Marriott definitely stands out. But the Asian-style fa&#231;ade belies the contemporary interior. The ten pool terrace rooms are the most enticing options: they come with private verandas and in-room bathtubs bathed in sunlight; the pool suite comes with its own private dip pool. Nightlife options are good: there&#146;s the Crossroads Caf&#233; (a people-watching hotspot); the late-opening Living Room cocktail bar; and lively music venue <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Club/bar-none">b:one</a>.

				<description><![CDATA[
&#160;
It&#146;s not quite paradise on earth, but the Shangri-La provides a super-luxurious retreat from the real world. Located off Orchard Road in spacious, landscaped grounds, it&#146;s got all the marble flooring, dripping chandeliers, soaring ceilings, grand artworks, sumptuous furnishings and polished staff you&#146;d expect of a five-star hotel. There are three sections: the Valley Wing is the most exclusive, with its own entrance, lobby and lifts. Rooms in the low-rise Garden Wing have bougainvillea-draped balconies overlooking the freeform swimming pool, while the extra-large Horizon Club rooms in the Tower Wing are popular with business travellers. Enjoy a lavish buffet breakfast in fashionable poolside restaurant the Line. The Shangri-La hotel group also owns the Rasa Sentosa Resort on the western tip of Sentosa.

				<description><![CDATA[The Royal Plaza has always been sought after, thanks to its reputation for excellent service, affordable rates and convenient location on Scotts Road. But some upgrading was needed to keep up with the competition; the hotel reopened &#150; as a no-smoking property &#150; in early 2007. The grand marble lobby with its twin curving staircases sets the scene for a host of luxurious touches, even in the standard rooms (32in LCD TV, ultra-comfortable beds with hypo-allergenic pillows). Notable additions include a brand-new lounge bar, Heat, and the all-buffet restaurant Carousel. Business travellers will appreciate the free wireless internet access.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The award-winning Meritus Mandarin had a $52 million refurb in 2003, so it&#146;s looking pretty smart these days. Popular with business travellers, it&#146;s a big place &#150; with two 40-storey towers, South and Grand, housing more than 1,000 rooms &#150; so not exactly cosy. But the rooms, decorated in soothing neutral colours, marry elegance with comfort; and there are recreational facilities galore, including tennis and squash courts, a gym, sauna and a big outdoor pool. Shoppers will enjoy the Mandarin Gallery (with stores like Emporio Armani and Montblanc) when it opens later in the year, while the <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/restaurants/Asian/chatterbox">Chatterbox</a> restaurant on level 39 offers panoramic city views and its famed Mandarin Chicken Rice.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The distinguished Goodwood Park boasts a deeply romantic castle-style tower and a rich history. Built in 1900 as the Teutonia Club, an exclusive retreat for German expats, it became a hotel in 1929; the grounds were used for war crimes trials after World War II. It still has a majestic air, with elegant columns and classical archways. Rooms are mostly done up in the tropical colonial uniform of creams, beiges and creams. Highlights include the wooden-shuttered poolside suites, and classy Sichuan restaurant Min Jiang. High-rollers stay in the aristocratic Brunei Suite, which includes a spacious lounge, study and grand dining room with rooftop garden &#150; all accessed by its own private lift.

Concentrate on its delicious range of rum babas, sfogliatelles, tiramisus and fruit gelatos. Chef Stefano Deiuri and his ancestors have been making pastries since 1580, and it shows in every single mouthful. For a relaxing, post-dinner treat, sit outside facing the river.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[When the stars come to Singapore, they stay at the Four Seasons. Located just off Orchard Road, it&#146;s more intimate than many of Singapore&#146;s luxury hotels. Guest rooms are decorated in an understated luxurious style, but with local touches such as tropical plants, colonial-style furnishings and Asian art. The custom-designed beds are comfortable enough to cure insomniacs. The swimming pool is a sultry retreat, and the air-conditioned tennis courts make matches bearable in the Singapore heat. The Sunday champagne brunch in One-Ninety restaurant is a lavish affair.

				<description><![CDATA[For a budget hotel, the Strand is surprisingly stylish. The rooms, fashionably decorated in rich colours and simple woods, are a good size, though the bathrooms are short on toiletries. For a memorable stay, ask for a &#145;special&#146; room; these come with flamboyant decor &#150; leopard print walls, anyone? &#150; and glass-walled bathrooms (not ideal for the bashful). The central location is great for exploring Little India, Orchard Road or the Colonial District.

German sausages rule at Brotzeit (German for &#145;bread time&#146;) &#150; big fat loops of them served every which way. Our favourites include grilled garlic pork sausages resting on a mound of perfectly saut&#233;ed potato discs and subtly tart sauerkraut, and the thick slabs of beef that were slow-boiled till they turned tender and sweet. Desserts are especially a treat: the apple strudel is a huge roll of fruit with whispery sheets of pastry and a crunch of almonds, while the shredded pancake with custard and strawberry confit is heaven on a plate. Come in hungry &#150; the servings here are huge. The salads easily make an entire meal too.]]></description>

The hostel&#146;s rustic charms are complemented by contemporary decorative touches. Some of the dorms rooms are set aside for women only, and there are private rooms too.

				<description><![CDATA[Singapore&#146;s answer to the Leaning Tower of Pisa, this budget hotel is famous for tilting slightly (don&#146;t worry &#150; it is structurally safe). Built in 1953, it used to be a party haunt for British officers. These days the exterior is run-down, but there are charming old-fashioned touches such as a cage lift and dramatic spiral staircase. The rooms are clean and simply decorated; all come with a TV, and some have DVD players and en suite bathrooms. The backpacker brigade appreciates the beer garden, sun deck, games room, internet access and bike rental.

				<description><![CDATA[If you can get past the cheesy name, the Inn Crowd is an excellent hostel. The vibe is friendly and relaxed, the decor cheerful and stylish, and the mattresses top quality. There is a wealth of extras too: a travel library, rooftop garden, open-air showers and a hearty breakfast (Marmite included). Skylights and full windows let in plenty of natural light, and the owner &#150; who stays in the house &#150; keeps the place spick and span. Little India is just outside your door.

				<description><![CDATA[A stylish little hotel-hostel, perched atop Mount Emily Park, near the Istana. Rooms are basic, but clean and bright, with Ikea-style furniture; most are doubles, but a handful sleep three or more. The rooftop terrace is a bonus, with barbecue pit, &#145;standing shower pool&#146; and loungers. Breakfast is served in the ground-floor dining area, which becomes the funky Wild Rocket restaurant at lunch and dinner. The Hangout is a short walk from Little India, but the steep steps make carrying luggage a no-no. Staff are friendly and obliging.

				<description><![CDATA[Despite the evocative name, this is not a decadent oasis. Instead, Fragrance is about getting a bang for your buck. True, this branch of the local chain boasts luxuries such as a rooftop swimming pool, broadband access and LCD TVs with DVD players. But the rooms are tiny &#150; steer clear if you are either tall or claustrophobic. And the hotel can get noisy. Still, the location is tough to beat.

				<description><![CDATA[There&#146;s nothing particularly spectacular about this three-star hotel with 63 modestly furnished rooms, but its location is great &#150; bang in the heart of Little India. It&#146;s also good value for money, and rooms come with all the usual mod cons: cable TV, air-conditioning, a safe and even a hairdryer. Rollaway beds cost an extra $25.

				<description><![CDATA[With its central location, the Rendezvous is easy for just that; it&#146;s handy for both the CBD and Orchard Road shopping, as well as the National Museum and Singapore Art Museum. The architecture is a curious hybrid:&#8200;a three-storey colonial building backed by a modern 11-storey edifice. The fern-fringed lobby strikes an elegant note with its marble floor mosaics. Rooms are polished but plain: a quiet mix of white bedding and pastel hues. But the glass-roofed courtyard leaves the biggest impression, along with the Balinese-style swimming pool and the well-regarded Straits Caf&#233; (try the nasi padang), which overlooks Bras Basah Park.

				<description><![CDATA[Located next to the Mustafa Centre and its 24-hour bustle, this chain hotel is a popular choice with Indian tourists. The ambience is, well, chain-like, but the 341 rooms have been refurbished and there are practical advantages (a self-service laundry, for instance, for long-term stays). The lap pool is large and enticing, and the Spice Brasserie serves local and international cuisine until 1am.

				<description><![CDATA[Located above an ageing shopping mall and accessed by an escalator, the Golden Landmark is not easy to find. But the rooms are spacious and well equipped (including cable TV and broadband), though the bathrooms could be spruced up. If the hotel lacks character, its location doesn&#146;t: the colourful shopping and eating options of Bugis and Arab Streets are nearby. Honeymooners and older guests might find it all a bit noisy, though the greenery around the pool provides some tranquility.

				<description><![CDATA[The Albert Court Hotel is at the southern end of Little India, just over Rochor Canal. The building, a refurbished pre-war shophouse complete with a tropical courtyard, has got plenty of character. The epitome of &#145;old meets new&#146;, the rooms come with all mod cons &#150; including broadband &#150; but retain an authentic feel thanks to Peranakan touches. Extras include a gym, steam room and Jacuzzi. Good value]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Situated in a clutch of restored 1920s shophouses, the InterContinental is a luxurious nostalgia kick. The elegant rooms fuse Peranakan and colonial decor: think oriental rugs, wooden floors and hand-painted lampshades, along with ornate tapestries. The old stuff contrasts with modern gadgetry (nifty iPod docking stations), and everything has a contemporary sheen. The rooftop pool has a tropical vibe with its palms. The traditional Victoria Bar evokes old Singapore; there&#146;s live jazz and Latin in the Lounge Bar; choose from Mediterranean, Japanese or Chinese food in the three restaurants.

				<description><![CDATA[This boutique hotel, created out of ten beautifully refurbished shophouses, exudes character. The mood-lit lobby sets the stage for the sumptuous decor:&#8200;dark wooden furnishings, dramatic red walls and drapes, plush purple carpets and gilt-edged antique mirrors. Rooms are on the small side, but rates are very reasonable. The location, in a red-light district, adds to the frisson of decadence.

				<description><![CDATA[Bang in the heart of Chinatown, the Inn at Temple Street is a small hotel with big character. Owned by the sons of the late Kho Beng Kang (aka &#145;the Nutmeg King&#146;), the hotel tries to revive the era when Kho was the region&#146;s largest spice trader. Hence there are plenty of decorative antique objects, along with intricately carved wooden furniture and murals. But rooms are small and some don&#146;t have windows (ask to see your room before checking in).]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The Scarlet Hotel is indeed scarlet &#150; and gold and black; dramatic furniture, chandeliers and polished surfaces add to the sexy, boudoir-glam vibe. Occupying a series of shophouses at the top of Erskine Road, it&#146;s much favoured by media and design types. The public areas (especially the bar, lobby and lovely rooftop bar <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Bars/breeze">Breeze</a>) are the best; rooms are small and some are windowless, though beds are comfortable. Opt for a suite, if you can. There&#146;s a tiny outdoor Jacuzzi and mini gym.

				<description><![CDATA[In 2002, owner Peng Loh (who also owns the <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/tourists/venues/hotels/new-majestic-hotel">New Majestic</a>) turned five colonial shophouses into this 32-room boutique property. A vast collection of designer chairs &#150; including vintage Verner Panton, and Charles and Ray Eames designs &#150; decorate different corners of the hotel. Suites come with an outdoor bathtub, and there&#146;s a Jacuzzi on the rooftop. Admittedly, the rooms are a little on the small side, but they&#146;re equipped with flatscreen TVs, broadband and designer Marimekko bedspreads.

An ideal spot for two very different types of people: those desiring a comfortable rest after an energetic stag night, or those looking for a more affordable colonial-era experience.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Under the same ownership as nearby <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/tourists/venues/hotels/hotel-1929">Hotel 1929</a>, the New Majestic opened to great acclaim in 2006. From the big white lobby with its vintage fans and designer chairs to the idiosyncratic themed guest rooms &#150; each one different &#150; the whole place is a style statement. Brightly coloured wall murals, created by local artists and designers, are a feature, as are claw-footed bathtubs (perhaps encased in glass in the middle of the room, or set outside in a mini garden). Some rooms are two-level, others have hanging beds. There&#146;s a small pool, with portholes in the bottom that overlook the in-house Cantonese restaurant, <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/restaurants/Chinese/majestic">Majestic</a>.
<em>The</em> <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Bars/new-majestic-bar"><em>Majestic Bar</em></a><em> next door is also owned by the Hotel.</em>

The innovative decor is themed around wood, fire, earth, metal and water, and the offices of the CBD are a walk away (as is the bustling port area; corner rooms overlook it). The chic, minimalist rooms boast sleek bathrooms, flatscreen TVs, mood lighting and high-speed internet access. A spa, gym and pool are located on the 11th floor: the spa comes with state of the art hydrotherapy facilities;&#8200;two outdoor massage pools are equipped with 12 hydro-jets. The cool Caf&#233; 2000 serves Asian fusion fare.

				<description><![CDATA[Built in 1928, the former General Post Office was transformed into an award-winning luxury hotel in 2001. The Palladian building is a striking landmark on the edge of the Singapore River; inside, the grand, soaring atrium makes the most of the unusual, wedge-shaped floorplan. The room aesthetics are cool, clean and serene; creams, beiges and browns, with dark wood furnishings and fresh flowers. All come with the latest gizmos and gadgets for staying connected. Request one of the Quay rooms, which have spectacular views over the river and colonial civic area. The splendid outdoor pool faces the same way; it&#146;s almost like you&#146;re swimming in the city. The slap-up buffet breakfast is one of the best in town, and classy cocktails are served in the fashionable <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Bars/post-bar">Post Bar</a>.

				<description><![CDATA[Although the Novotel Clarke Quay was recently renovated, little about the property stands out.

The large, glossy rooms come with raised beds, flatscreen TVs, DVD players and &#150; a definite selling point &#150; gorgeous bathrooms with Bulgari toiletries and a panoramic view (of the city or harbour) from the bathtub.

Meritus Club rooms come with extras such as coffeemakers, a six-jet power shower and plush pillow-top mattresses. The three restaurants (Italian, Chinese and international) are stylishly designed, and the lounge offers a soundtrack of tropical Asian birds. Other features include a 25m mineral water pool, the Open Studio (an artist-in-residence programme) and dendrobium Marina Mandarin, a local orchid that is scattered throughout the hotel in floral arrangements and as a decorative motif.

Business amenities include broadband and video/ audio conferencing. A palm-fringed pool and three restaurants complete the picture.

				<description><![CDATA[Near the airport, this coastal retreat offers a respite from the hustle and bustle of downtown. The chic, minimalist rooms come with an open bath area, rain shower and views of the sea or garden. But the most spectacular view, of Malaysia and the island of Pulau Ubin, is from the lovely rooftop pool. Distractions are plentiful: a day trip to Pulau Ubin or a pampering treatment at the Retreat Spa &#38; Thalasso Centre. Take note: a nearby car park serves as a cruising spot for transvestites and prostitutes. ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Opened in 2006, this hotel has a great location, on the edge of Siloso Beach and a short walk via the nature trail to the sights at Imbiah Lookout. It&#146;s a long slab of a building; make sure you get a room overlooking the beach. Or better still, a rooftop suite with its own outdoor deck and mini Jacuzzi. The pool, with a waterfall at one end, is a winner. Breakfast is served on the hotel&#146;s rooftop. Twelve stand-alone villas should be ready by summer 2007.

				<description><![CDATA[

&#160;
Shaped like a curved cruise ship, the Rasa Sentosa (part of the smart Shangri-La chain) has all the right ingredients for a tropical seaside holiday. Located on the western tip of Sentosa, its rooms are airy and bright, with balconies providing sweeping views of the sea or lush gardens. The large swimming pool and white sands of Siloso Beach keep the kids entertained (it&#146;s a great place for a short family break) and sporty types can flex their muscles on the rock wall, play petanque or go paddle-skiing. ]]></description>

&#160;
Perched on a cliff overlooking the South China Sea, the Sentosa Resort &#38; Spa is tailor-made for honeymoons. The lush tropical grounds and beautiful landscaped water gardens cry out for a romantic stroll. Sunsets are a spectacle, best watched from the bar at <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/restaurants/Modern/the-cliff">The Cliff restaurant</a><a href="javascript:void(0);/*1216261335571*/">&#8200;</a>or the wooden walkway leading down to Palawan Beach. After a slick refurb, all the rooms have been spruced up with designer everything, elegant teak furniture, DVD/ CD players and huge plasma TVs. Outdoor enthusiasts can hire bikes, play tennis or visit the adjacent Sentosa Golf Club. But the showstopper is the Spa Botanica a haven of mud baths, float pools, tranquil treatment rooms and a meditation labyrinth. ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[All four of the Pasta Fresca branches (in Siglap, Bukit Timah, Boat Quay and Changi Airport Terminal 2) are pretty similar in terms of d&#233;cor, service and food. They were not created with the aim of being destination fine-dining establishments, but rather to be your reliable neighbourhood restaurant, with a menu that offers the same comfort as an old friend. There are no surprises in store, just solid cooking of some Italian classics alongside a range of fresh pastas, tasty risottos and crispy oven-baked pizzas.]]></description>

Staying here offers you a fast-track introduction to the more laidback side of the island.

Shopaholics and foodies take note: Parkway Parade Shopping Centre and Marine Parade Food Centre are just across the road.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Opened in 1937, this weird and wonderful park was named after its owners, Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par, the brothers who made their fortune from the acclaimed cure-all ointment Tiger Balm (it&#146;s also known as Tiger Balm Gardens). Multicoloured statues and tableaux &#150; some looking rather neglected&#150; depict scenes from Chinese history and mythology. The highlight is the Ten Courts of Hell (responsible for childhood nightmares for generations of Singaporeans) where small-scale tableaux show human sinners being punished in a variety of hideous and bloodthirsty ways &#150; in extremely gory and graphic detail. It&#146;s a safe bet that you will never see anything like it anywhere else.

				<description><![CDATA[The museum commemorates the brave defence given by the vastly outnumbered soldiers of the Malay Regiment against the Japanese in the Battle of Pasir Panjang. Downstairs, documentary material is gathered in display cases, while the upstairs rooms recreate the building&#146;s military past. Alongside familiar facts about how the Japanese swept down through Malaya, there&#146;s some intriguing information about the role of British racism in an initial reluctance to train and arm the local Malays. No one proved such prejudices more wrong than Lieutenant Adnan Saidi, and the display makes a heroic effort to cement his heroic reputation. That said, his diminutive projection in a natty multi-media replay of the final battle risks recalling Princess Leia&#146;s hologram rather than Luke Skywalker fighting off the forces of evil. ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The long MRT trip to Kranji affords plenty of time to contemplate the serried rows of public housing that represent one of the Singapore government&#146;s greatest yet most perplexingly drab achievements. By contrast, the serried rows of 4,000 white gravestones at this peaceful hillside cemetery have a serene, if solemn beauty. Dominated by the huge, wing-like Singapore Memorial, and fronted by a Sir Edwin Lutyens-designed memorial stone, the site includes several monuments for servicemen massacred in the early days of the Japanese Occupation, and one for those lying in &#145;unmaintainable graves&#146; elsewhere in South-east Asia. The inscriptions tell countless tales of death and sacrifice, and you can easily spend an hour piecing together a picture of the British Empire in all its diversity. Also here are the tombs of the first two presidents of Singapore.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This 1.64sq km (0.63sq mile) nature reserve is renowned for having one of the richest and most diverse ecosystems in the world. Besides hundreds of animal and insect species, it also contains more tree species than the whole of North America. Weekends are busy with walkers, nature lovers and mountain bikers, so come on a weekday if you prefer a quiet trek. There are four walking trails. A steep paved path takes you directly to the peak, but more interesting are the unpaved trails; route 3 (green) follows a winding forest path, past caves used by Japanese soldiers in World War II. Look out for long-tailed macaques, squirrrels and snakes, and listen for the incessant &#145;chonk-chonk&#146; of the striped tit-babbler. Cyclists should wear protective gear as the biking trail is extremely rugged. The visitor centre has toilets and souvenirs, but no food. ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The next time you watch a film so troubling you need a stiff drink immediately, you&#146;ll be thankful for this little watering hole. The alfresco hangout spot on the fourth floor has a lovely view &#150; and will be even lovelier once the never-ending construction of the Circle Line is completed. While it&#146;s not particularly spacious, Ebar is still a welcome respite from the bustle of the mall and a handy place to cool your heels while waiting for your boyfriend/girlfriend to get his/her bits waxed. If you&#146;re a teetotaller, there are basic beverages such as coffee, but otherwise knock back a beer ($6-$7 per glass), or sip on a glass of wine ($9 per glass or $42 a bottle). Go down from 6-8pm, and enjoy one-for-one offers on vino.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The Tapas Tree franchise &#150; now three-strong with outposts in Changi Village, Clarke Quay and One Fullerton &#173; &#150; makes a neat and unexpected rebuttal to the charge that all budget chain restaurants are peddlers of mediocrity. Happily, this lively, ever-popular trio of Spanish specialists manages to sidestep the usual pratfalls common to outlets of a similar ilk: a lack of culinary ambition, zero atmosphere, slightly crappy food and anonymous, if not totally inept service.   <br />
<br />
For a start, the designers have clearly been to Spain. The decor is warm and well considered with terracotta flooring, yellow-washed walls, sympathetic lighting, mosaic-tiled tables and those cool, &#146;20s Berlin-style fans. All right, so there&#146;s the odd picture that looks like it could have been lifted from the waiting room of a Romanian dental surgery, but it&#146;s mostly a winning effort. It feels homely, working to achieve a Spanish personality rather than just a theme.    <br />
<br />
Paella is available, but plays second fiddle to the tapas. The menu is huge, which usually makes for a dim portent for quality &#150; but not here. All the classic tapas standards are present and correct: patatas bravas were many in number but could have been more crispy; the nicely salted calamares fritos were chewy and arrived with a generous dollop of zesty garlic aioli; the saut&#233;ed mussels were big and meaty with a rich, herb-flecked spicy tomato sauce. Further down the menu there&#146;s evidence the kitchen works hard to deviate from clich&#233; and show some flair: try the braised duck breast in orange sauce or the baked scallops in saffron sauce, both standout winners. <br />
<br />
Unusually for a Spanish joint, The Tapas Tree makes quite a substantial nod to vegetarian types who are, quite rightly, treated with widespread suspicion in Spain given the country&#146;s quasi-religious appetite for cured meats and shellfish. Saut&#233;ed artichoke hearts with olive oil and garlic sauce were tender and artfully presented. Drinks are fairly priced, service chipper: for anyone looking for a walk-up or a decent spot by the river in Clarke Quay, you could do much worse than here.<br />
<br />
<em>The Tapas Tree, 3D River Valley Road #01-08 <em>Clarke Quay</em>; </em><em>Block 5 <em>Changi Village</em> Road; 3 Fullerton Road #01-04 (6837 2938, www.thetapastree.com). </em><em>Open 11.30am-midnight, Mon-Thu; 11.30pm-1am Fri-Sun. Tapas $5-$18.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Unlike its sister restaurant in Tanjong Pagar, there is nothing about the Sentosa version that even whispers &#145;Thai restaurant&#146;, least of all its blandly pleasant interior decor. But looks are deceiving, for the dishes that emerge from the kitchen very ably fly the Thai flag, courtesy of a consultant chef to the royal family. Be adventurous and be surprised by the kang kong fritters: dense nests of tempura&#146;ed vegetables paired with a sweet, gelatinous sauce laced with minced pork. Unusually, the duck curry is studded with pineapple and longan, the sweet globes a welcome partner to the earthier tones of the meat. Worth a special journey out to Sentosa.<br />

				<description><![CDATA[A step up from the neighbouring watering holes of Harry&#146;s and Home Beach Bar, the recently opened <em>Le Carillon de L&#146;Angelus</em> brings a touch of French style to Robertson Quay. Housed in the same building as the Tyler Print Institute, and in the same style as its counterpart on Ann Siang Hill (read: French movie posters, chill-out music and a pool table to boot), it&#146;s a great place to go after dinner at one of the Quay&#146;s many restaurants to drink the fine wines (house wines are $10 a glass) and enjoy the view over the river.
<em>Bottles $48 and upwards.</em>
Le Carillon de l'Angelus won Best Wine Bar in our <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/general/feature/all-in-the-best-possible-taste">Who is top of the Table?</a> feature.<br />

				<description><![CDATA[A Siglap neighbourhood favourite, especially with families and couples, for as long as anyone can remember, Baba Inn has all the hallmarks of a great Peranakan joint, including incredibly dour and bo-chap service. Question: &#145;Is the assam sotong nice?&#146; Answer: &#145;It is if you like it.&#146; Happily, we do, the hit of assam a vinegary foil for the fried, salty and lemongrass-scented squid. The ngo hiang is among the best in town, its crackly beancurd skin delicately wrapped around a juicy, meaty interior. And for pure joy, it&#146;s hard to beat white rice with hard-boiled eggs blanketed with a pungent, tongue-tingling sambal, paired with the rich, sharp acidity of the spicy prawn and pineapple soup.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Prices may be steep, but there really is nowhere else quite like Flutes for a romantic meal <em>&#224; deux</em> or a special occasion. The restaurant&#146;s setting is as delicious as the food, located in an old black-and-white colonial home tucked away among the frangipani of <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/aroundtown/venues/Attractions/fort-canning-park">Fort Canning&#146;s</a> slopes, behind the Hill Street Fire Station. Lovingly converted from offices a few years ago by Singaporean lawyer-turned-restaurateur Stephanie Magnus, the modern Australian menu features such hits as a salad of warm smoked kangaroo followed by roasted Australian lamb rack with lotus chips and garlic mash. Any complaints? The waiters can be a little too quick to top up the wine glass, which can make the wooden steps down to the street a little hard to navigate. Bookings are essential, particularly for the outside tables on the wooden terrace.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The latest baby from the prolific Marmalade Group starts with an awesome wine list (get a load of that sensational wine tower) and then builds a menu of to-share tapas-sized dishes around it. Who knew that roasted bone marrow, sprinkled with parsley salt, could taste so deliciously like foie gras? Or that pork belly could achieve such a firm &#150; yet moist &#150; texture? But if tapas is not your thing, then consider the bouillabaisse, which arrives in a small black cauldron brimming with mussels, fish wedges, prawns and scallops. Recommended tipple: the golden melony notes of the Saint Clair. Downer: the toilet is an annoying schlep into the adjoining office tower.
<em>Tapas $8-$15, and main courses $18-$45.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[What better combination than a little caf&#233; and a roomful of glossy cookbooks? The range and depth of titles is impressive (albeit a little Eurocentric) and gastronomically inspiring. Against a soundtrack of Michael Bubl&#233; and Sanseverino, the tiny kitchen churns out hearty, imaginative and comforting food. Tuck into tender saut&#233;ed pork slabs marinated with a citrusy mojito sauce, paired with wonderfully crisp wedges and a minty, garlicky cucumber salad. The chicken casserole, thick with carrots and potato, was nostalgic, though the Caesar salad, while tasting just right, was a little soggy. For dessert, the sticky date pudding provided a lovely hit of ginger. There&#146;s a small wine list (mainly Australian) with $10 glasses, and bottles from $40.<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Such a pity this place still remains so far under the radar. The German fare is comfortably homey, traditional <em>und sehr gut</em>; and if nothing else, the massive pork knuckle &#150; all crackly skinned and meaty, with mounds of pea mash and sauerkraut &#150; will keep you happily entertained. The bratwurst, its taut skin scored before being grilled to a crispy finish, is delicious. Also fab are the <em>flammkuchens</em>, the Teutonic version of pizzas, topped with everything from bacon and leek to sausages. Meanwhile, the wine list covers every one of Germany&#146;s wine regions, with glasses starting from $9. A minus is the kitchen&#146;s inadequate exhaust system, so sit either along the five-foot way or in the entry annex, rather than the main dining room.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[With all that timber panelling, the dining room feels a little claustrophobic, while the acoustics are so bad you spend the whole meal forced to speak in whispers or risk having everyone at the next table listen in on every word. Thank goodness, then, for the calibre of the kitchen and the silkysmooth service. It&#146;s the simple dishes that shine; like lush oniony mapo tofu, dark green kai lan braised in a rich stock, and soft tofu seared with chicken pieces, salted fish and chunky bites of Chinese mushrooms. The dim sum menu is particularly good with the yam dumpling &#150; creamy and crunchy with little diced carrots and water chestnuts &#150; one of the best in town.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Housed in a nondescript location next to the Maserati showroom, this place doesn&#146;t often have random walk-ins; instead, it&#146;s mostly frequented by regulars and whisky specialists coming for a taste of their favourite malt. Opened just a few months ago by a whisky-loving husband-and-wife team, it stocks over 100 different kinds of the &#145;water of life&#146; (mostly Scotch), and then some, from places like Wales, Ireland, Japan, America, Canada and even India. Not that they&#146;ll turn you away, but if you are looking for whisky green tea drinks, you might want to go elsewhere; here, you sip your whisky neat or with a sturdy, egg-sized lump of ice.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[On an island not so far away, there opened a new bar called Priv&#233;. Located across a sleek, trendy-looking bridge (if a bridge can be referred to as &#145;trendy&#146;) on the ground floor of the marina at Keppel Island, Priv&#233; is stunning in the simplicity of its decor, and how it incorporates the sights and sparkling lights of the marina and nearby Caribbean-style condo into its open, breezy atmosphere. Its newness is reflected in the way the staff approach you tepidly, and how panic flashes across their faces when you ask them to cite their most popular cocktails. But the drinks are well made and you come back to the main island (yes, Singapore) feeling like you&#146;ve been away.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[With its exquisitely prepared food and classy furnishings, eating at Novus Restaurant makes for a helluva good dinner date, so it&#146;s no wonder the place is always booked up. But if you&#146;re the sort who eschews food for booze, you&#146;ll be happy to know that there is always space at the bar. Station yourself at the long bar within the posh interior or outside in the lovely courtyard &#150; if you don&#146;t mind the occasional mozzie. But sacrificing a little blood is nothing when you consider the brilliant cocktails served up, with names such as Raspberry Sizzle ($20) and Pink Guavatini ($16). Drink promos change on a nightly basis, so call ahead and check.

				<description><![CDATA[Sometimes after a hard day&#146;s work, you just want a quick drink before you pop into the MRT train and head home to your attention-seeking big baby of a spouse, not to mention the kids. This alfresco spot churns out lounge tunes as you swig a variety of drinks, from champagne to margaritas, for just about $10 (champagne, fruit martinis, bellinis, etc&#133;) during its happy hour from 5-9pm. Apart from the reasonably priced tipple, you&#146;re also served free mini Wagyu beef burgers until 7pm. If all of this does nothing for you, the breezy open-air concept should clear your head at the least.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The trend of places opening just off the beaten path continues with Cicada, a quiet, no-frills restobar nestled at the end of a long, winding road. The sister establishment of <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Bars/hacienda">Hacienda</a>, this feels like the shyer sibling who doesn&#146;t care for pomp and pageantry. Instead, it opts for soft music and lighting in its alfresco area that&#146;s minimalist (some might say &#145;spartan&#146;) with a few tables, booths and, thankfully, a large fan. Expect a large variety of martinis and a decent selection of house wines that start from $8 a glass. Note: Be sure to have the taxi company&#146;s number on speed-dial or getting out of this rural spot will be a pain.

				<title>The Bar and Alfresco at Four Seasons Singapore</title>

				<description><![CDATA[If there&#146;s one thing the Four Seasons is known for, it&#146;s an exceptional level of service. At its newly revamped bar and alfresco space, the staff makes you feel like you own a million bucks from the moment you sit down. Waitresses flock to you bearing a menu, a multi-tiered snack stand containing &#150; no, not plain peanuts, but freshly roasted pepper-coated almonds, and even your choice of newspapers. Meanwhile, the lounge songstress croons breathy, jazzy tunes while small groups of businessmen sit around shuffling documents in the luxuriously designed space. Boasting warm, earthy tones both in the interior bar and the outdoor alfresco areas, the latter in particular evokes a laid-back natural setting with its verdant landscaping and sandstone installation-slashwaterfall. Couple that with a delicious martini (try the Passionfruit, $28) that they shake vigorously in a showy display at your table, and you&#146;ll be wishing you had a room there.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Tucked away from the crowd in a corner of <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/restaurants/International/dempsey-hill">Dempsey Hill</a> (aka the pretentious-sounding &#145;Tanglin Village&#146;) is Angel&#146;s Share &#150; which is winemakers&#146; lingo for wine lost through evaporation during the ageing process. This wine bar, in a classy, somewhat rustic, location, features freestanding flaming torches, plush outdoor seating right on the grass and a DJ spinning a good mix of jazz and house tunes. Sit back, chill and pretend you&#146;re in wine county with more than 700 labels (mainly from Australia, California, France and Italy) to choose from. A glass of moderately priced housepour sauvignon blanc goes for $13 and a bottle of Henriot champers is yours for $120. It&#146;s a shame the cocktails appeared truly lacklustre (read: not particularly alcoholic); perhaps the bartender was trying to save the owners a few bucks, or maybe it&#146;s just another tie-in to the bar&#146;s responsible drinking policy and drive-home service.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Now <em>this </em>place has a strange door policy: while there is a cover charge, they also told us that &#145;it&#146;s free if you&#146;re trendy enough&#146;. Oh, and models who show up with their com card in tow get six free drinks. Then again, we&#146;re happy to forgive because this intimate space &#150; previously Liquid Room &#150; churns out some of the best electronic dance and house music on the island. This club is not for those looking to chill. It&#146;s better suited for those looking for a big night of hard partying &#150; and its menu, boasting more than 15 types of shooters, certainly helps.

				<description><![CDATA[The soothing scent of lemongrass oil is a nice touch to remind you of Bangkok, especially after the dowdy Tanglin Mall outside. The cooking certainly doesn&#146;t disappoint. Not the cold, sweet juice of a young coconut; not the plump prawns buried beneath the creamy otah-otah; not the luscious, juicy pork belly braised with soy, coriander, coconut and cassia bark; not the eggplant topped with crabmeat, or cooked with fried basil; nor even the ginger-infused glass noodles baked with ruby-red prawns. It&#146;s all good.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The modern space &#150; with its timber and brick decor, and campy soundtrack of Bananarama and Rick Astley &#150; gives little hint of its Thai provenance. But the breezy menu, dotted with snapshots of Bangkok, dishes out quickly cooked and delicious staples. Start with a pomelo salad tossed with chilli and dried shrimp or the fried discs of fish cakes sprinkled with fried basil leaves. Tender chunks of curry-marinated chicken are charcoaled in pandan leaves, while the sweet, thick gravy of the massaman curry has tender chunks of beef and potato. Wash it all down with a tall glass of chilled lemongrass tea.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The plain-Jane interiors are almost incidental to the small menu of superbly executed Peranakan standards. There&#146;s squid braised with tomatoes and thick green chilli cuts; a deliciously nutty satay pork and gently braised chap chye. The chicken buah keluak is superb &#150; the sauce is a rich, shimmering pool stained midnight black by the ubiquitous nut. Also try the itek tim, a duck soup swirling with tartness and sweetness. Reasonable prices coupled with no service charges or GST make this one of our favourite dining destinations.]]></description>

The caf&#233; is child-friendly and will even do half portions of its generous servings. A favourite with tykes is the penne bolognese, all rich and meaty; adults steer toward the wholesome antipasto plate consisting of a grocer&#146;s list of goodies such as grilled eggplants, ham and goat cheese. The chicken salad is a large mound heaped with sweet avocado and a thick coating of toasted almond flakes. The date pudding remains a favourite; it&#146;s a pity the accompanying ice cream is of such inferior quality.]]></description>

Service is brisk and the food arrives on the table in waves. Ramen holds centre stage &#150; huge bowls of nutty strands float in a light stock. We love the version with a hard-boiled egg and thick discs of fatty, pale-coloured char-siew. Pair this with bijoux crescents of gyozas pungent with chives; creamy strips of grilled eel; and marshmallowy pillows of creamy tako yaki.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[A favourite with many East Coasters since opening three years ago, Chat Masala wins big points for both the consistent quality of its pan-Indian fare and the knowledge of the friendly serving staff. Among the top dishes to try are the Keralan fish curry (succulent chunks of red snapper in a fragrant sauce) and <em>bindi masala</em> (a spicy mix of okra, turmeric, coriander, cumin, tomatoes and chilli, served in a crisp poppadum basket).]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This part of Kitchener Road, a block from Jalan Besar Plaza, is endlessly fascinating for its Babel of locals: mainland Chinese and Nigerian communities crowd the restaurants restaurants and alleyways of the crumbling colonial shophouses. In the midst of all this, Pu Tien&#146;s menu is based on the diet of the trishaw riders of yore. On it, you&#146;ll find crunchy pancakes fried with shards of bitter gourd; sweet and sour pork and longan; fried buns stuffed with strips of soy-stained beef; and soup streaked with black seaweed. A must-have is the lightas- air bee hoon fried with seaweed, mushroom, peanuts and tiny cockles.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Romeo's&#160;brings to mind the adage, &#145;if it is too good to be true, it is&#146;. Whatever anyone says, no matter how pretty, shapely or feminine the ladies here come off, they once had an Adam&#146;s Apple. In fact, some probably still have one. Yes, the truth is hard to swallow. As the only real woman in the room, I found it vaguely amusing that this was the only establishment that served me my drink with a straw. Entertainment wise, you&#146;ll be hard-pressed to tear your eyes away from the door &#150; and the frenzy that starts the minute a new punter walks/peeks in &#150; and the pole-dancing platform where the girls unabashedly pose, roll, twirl, bend and do all sorts of body contortions as and when they please (ie, frequently) accompanied by high-pitched squeals. Once you&#146;ve had your eyeful (and have stopped gaping in awe), turn your gaze to the mirrors flanking both sides of the room, play I Spy with your mates and see who spots what&#133;you won&#146;t be disappointed.

				<description><![CDATA[Gunther&#146;s dining room &#150; white table linen, charcoal-grey walls and leather chairs with uncomfortably low armrests &#150; is suitably gloomy, hinting at expense accounts, clandestine affairs and anniversary meals. The kitchen&#146;s nouvelle leanings are especially evident when a creamy chunk of foie gras is encrusted with crushed toasted almonds and paired with stewed sweet cherries. Veal cheeks are braised in a dark mahogany-hued sauce till fork-tender, the richness of the meat an earthy foil for the smooth mash and baby peas saut&#233;ed with bacon bits. Desserts are crafted with the same attention to detail as mains: the sabayon, for instance, is a golden, liquid cloud of egg yolk, sugar and alcohol, pierced with macerated strawberries.<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Zhi-char goes up-market, though this has not been used as an excuse to crank prices up to unreasonable levels: Most dishes hover around the $10 mark, with seafood items pushing prices into the high teens. There&#146;s nothing fancy here, just old-fashioned food of the kind one would expect in neighbourhood zhi-char joints, but with a little more polish. Try the Grade AAA tofu, the whispery crisp skin breaking under the weight of its braised minced-prawn-and-pork topping to reveal a satiny, pale interior. The fried chicken recalls the best of Granny&#146;s cooking &#150; little battered nuggets flavoured with shards of dried chilli, vinegar and onion crescents.<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Having sprouted up just about everywhere in Singapore, it&#146;s no surprise Harry&#146;s found a corner in Suntec City Mall to call its own. And it&#146;s a corner, all right. Occupying a smidgen of a spot in the newly renovated Galleria section of the mall, it faces Nicoll Highway, so you sip your brew while staring out at the passing cars, which may be the most entertaining thing you can do here. The usual trappings of the pub chain remain &#150; bar, booze, mahogany furniture and LCD TVs screening sports games, and not much else. It&#146;s a gathering point for groups of buddies meeting up for their usual ales, especially during &#145;Harry&#146;s Crazy Hour&#146;, where housepours, wine and half-pint beers go for $6 each from 5-7pm.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Clarke Quay &#150; recently refurbished riverside development of old warehouses &#150; consists almost exclusively of bars and restaurants. A plastic jellyfish-looking roof has been built overhead, with fountains and huge fans in place to cool the customers moving between venues. Anyone studying branding should certainly visit, as it seems mandatory that each venue must be differently and strongly themed. Visitors from the UK might sense a similarity to a modern High Street at home (read: Croydon), with Aussie visitors feeling that this could be Singapore's Bondai. But who cares? Nobody, judging from the barely containable crowds there on weekends. If you like to bar hop furiously with everything under one roof, then Clarke Quay is for you; if you like kooky little places with no theme, then it&#146;s not.

				<description><![CDATA[Stepping into woodwould is like walking back in time. All around the store, you&#146;ll see old-skool typewriters, vintage furniture pieces and classic Ladybird storybooks. Sadly, most of these are not on sale, but what they do hawk are beautiful paper goods &#150; ranging from cards to notebooks, organisers to photo albums. If you&#146;re after something out of the ordinary, this is defi nitely the store. Seek out a wind-up tin carousel, a tin robot, or even strangely shaped pencil sharpeners and crazy pop-up wedding albums. Prices range from $4 for a card, $25 for a linen-covered journal and $250 for the aforementioned wedding album.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Nelly&#146;s slick, timber-and-tile-clad decor may not have that authentic Irish pub look, but it&#146;s still a cosy joint, where you can enjoy a quiet drink. There are eight beers on tap, including Guinness and Old Speckled Hen, and margaritas are suitably strong. Food-wise, the spicy chicken drumlets and Mexican salsa with corn chips are commendable, but give a wide berth to the bland potato wedges with chilli-crab dip. Happy hour ends at 8pm.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Pho Lan has the casual intimacy of a family-run restaurant. The specialty is pho &#150; thin strands of soft noodles wallowing in fragrant beef stock and crunchy bean sprouts. The spicy version is hit with lemongrass, ginger, onions and bones, and cooked for half a day. Also on the menu are rice paper rolls, sugar-cane sticks wrapped with prawn paste, sweet pomelo salads and fatty, charcoal-grilled pork seasoned with Vietnamese curry powder.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This place is always crowded, and a line often forms. But in the best traditions of Asian dining, you&#146;re usually seated (even if you end up sharing a table), eating and out the door in 40 minutes. The specialty is authentic Thai street food at easy-on-thewallet prices, and the menu is extensive with two or three size servings. The pad Thai is a lush portion of noodles, seafood, peanuts, vegetables and chilli flakes. The tom yam is a tureen crowded with spices and herbs, and hit with tart lime, while the mango salad comes studded with tiny onion slivers. End the meal with a coconut juice &#150; refreshingly sweet and dense with thick cuts of white flesh.

				<description><![CDATA[Al-Hamra is a neighbourhood favourite. Its Lebanese and Middle-Eastern menu features standards like kebabs (seafood, lamb, chicken) and meze, but everything is done with low-key finesse. The hummus is smooth and the eggplant pur&#233;e a smoky delight, while the grilled chicken, flavoured with mushrooms and garlic, is just the thing to pair with thyme-speckled zatar bread. The best table in the house, especially in the evening, is just at the entrance by the window overlooking Lorong Mambong. Though unfailingly polite, service can be a little &#145;blur&#146;, so grab the maitr&#234; d&#146;.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Tex-Mex is the name of the game here, and in a very good way. Even the opening salvo of golden corn chips in a blood-red salsa of tomato, chile and coriander deserves a little cry of joy. Highlights include a <em>chile con queso</em> (a creamy dip of tomatoes and cheese); perfectly breaded mushrooms sitting in a pool of heady garlic sauce; and pillowy home-made enchiladas cushioning fresh swimmer crabmeat with a hefty side of pinto beans, rice and salad. Probably the best seats in the house are out along the wide, breezy verandah, while tossing back a lethally potent, chilled margarita. Vegetarian versions of just about everything on the menu are also available.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[With barely six tables, serious jockeying and planning ahead is required to get into the first and only outlet outside Hong Kong of this famed Chinese private kitchen restaurant. The marquee attraction is graphic designer-turned-chef Jacky Yu&#146;s mesmerising multiple-course degustation menu (which changes once a month, on average). Yu&#146;s style combines chutzpah and bold flavours with Asian classics such as sweet coconut chicken soup; rotund tomatoes draped in a lush wasabi-sesame sauce; velvety broiled chicken snuggling up against cold soba tossed with peanuts and midnight hued century eggs; or even a terrific jumble of al dente Shanghainese rice cakes and kimchi.

				<description><![CDATA[The original Cathay Restaurant closed in 1964, and while Mark II bears no culinary connection, it&#146;s still a nostalgic blast. The menu is a comprehensive sweep of old-fashioned Cantonese standards, including double-boiled soups and kai-lan stir fried with wine, shallots and ginger. From the daily dim-sum menu, the steamed glutinous rice is a heavenly mix of moist rice and pork, while the delicious fried yam dumplings are shaped like tiny birds. The yin-yong noodles &#150; studded with bitter gourd, prawns and fish &#150; are amazingly good. The Peking duck is also worth ordering.]]></description>

The store provides three services: ready-to-wear, bespoke and special orders. Choose from a pair of tailored Capri pants ($180 off-the-rack, $220 special order), flirty layered skirts, off-the-shoulder silk tops, floral cotton blouses, or go all out with a one-of-a-kind evening dress (approximately $1,000) like the &#145;bike rchick cheongsam&#146;, which caught our eye at press time.&#160;<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Eden Caf&#233;&#146;s founder Clement Ronald Ng has a passion for floral cuisine and healthy cooking, avoiding all the usual additives in favour of natural ingredients. However, don&#146;t assume this means that all the food here lacks flavour or that the caf&#233; is devoid of any naughty treats. The rose-petal brownies and hibiscus cheese filo will prove you wrong on both counts. Unfortunately, the rest of the food (and the service) at this little Club Street eatery is a bit hit-and-miss, although the weekly lunch specials help liven up the rather unimaginative menu. What can&#146;t be criticised is the wealth of tea choices &#150; more than 100 types from around the world, each served in a range of interesting glass teapots. A second outlet, Eden Sanctuary, opened its doors for business in May 2008 at 44 Rochester Park.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Located next to the Discovery Centre, Singapore&#146;s very first army museum has six galleries detailing the history of the army and the contributions of National Service (NS) men. Among the 500 sets of artefacts are collections of medals, personal mementos from ex-NS men and a mock-up of a 1970s trainee bunk. Visitors can also enjoy a 30-minute interactive video, &#145;A Day in the Life&#146;, depicting a modern army in battle, complete with the &#145;sounds and smells&#146; of warfare, as well as games on battle simulators.
&#160;
<strong>Things to Do</strong>
&#160;
<strong>Army Operations </strong><br />
Decipher the codename of each army operation through this exhibition, which draws attention to our army&#146;s contributions to National Security and Regional Peacekeeping.
&#160;
<strong>Creating Our Future </strong><br />
What will the future look like? This exhibit attempts to answer that question through the eyes of our children and the artwork they produce. There will also be an interactive Robot World exhibit where you&#146;ll get a chance to control your own mechanical agent.
&#160;
<strong>From 1st Generation to 2nd Generation </strong><br />
Featuring two multimedia videos, &#145;Our Army Now&#146; and &#145;A Day in the Life of&#133;&#146;, this gallery, together with the military hardware on display, highlights the capabilities and readiness of our army that is equipped with not only advanced warfare technology, but also well-trained soldiers who have gone through National Service.
&#160;
<strong>Training to Be Ready </strong><br />
As warfare technology advances, the army has to constantly modify its training methods to equip the soldiers with the necessary skills to handle the latest weapons. The Individual Marksmanship Trainer (IMT) in this gallery provides the visitors with first-hand experience of handling these modified weapons, as well as the safety precautions involved.
&#160;
<strong>Birth of Our Army</strong><br />
This permanent gallery is a tribute to the country&#146;s National Service (NS) pioneers and servicemen. The key feature here is an overturned bus to remind visitors of the race riots of the 1960s.
&#160;
<strong>Making of a Soldier</strong><br />
The key item in this exhibit, which portrays an NS man&#146;s life in the 1970s-1980s, is an original basic military bunk bed from Pulau Tekong camp.
&#160;
<strong>Orientation Gallery</strong><br />
Above the entrance to the galleries are 40 screens, each showing 40 different NS enlistees from all walks of life. This multimedia presentation was commissioned by the Museum to commemorate 40 years of National Service and demonstrates how these men come together to form a cohesive platoon.
&#160;
<strong>Our People</strong><br />
A ten-minute short by filmmaker Roystan Tan (of 881 fame) shows how National Service has influenced the lives of generations of Singaporeans.
&#160;
<em>Adults $5, children &#38; senior citizens $3. <br />
Complimentary entry for all Servicemen* (daily); complimentary entry for all Servicemen* and four guests (Sat &#38; Sun, PH)<br />

				<description><![CDATA[
&#160;
One of the world&#146;s first &#145;open concept&#146; zoos &#150; residents live in landscaped enclosures instead of traditional cages &#150; this 28-hectare attraction is home to more than 4,000 animals, including the world&#146;s largest colony of orangutans, the exotic white tiger and the Hamadryas baboons.
&#160;
<strong>Things to Watch at the Zoo</strong>
<strong>Elephants at Work &#38; Play </strong><em> <br />
Daily; 11.30am &#38; 3.30pm </em><br />
After watching their affectionate interaction with their keepers, it&#146;s hard not to find these Thai working elephants endearing. This show reveals the cooperation between these giant mammals and their mahouts during the logging process (Elephants of Asia exhibit).
<br />
<strong>Splash Safari </strong><em><br />
Daily; 11am, 2.30pm &#38; 5pm</em><br />
The jackass penguin, Californian sealion, Caribbean manatees and pelicans star in this show that not only serves to entertain, but also attempts to educate the audience about wildlife conservation and highlight the dangers that marine animals are facing around the world (Splash Amphitheatre).
<br />
<strong>Polar Bear Viewing Exhibit </strong>In addition to providing these marine mammals with an icy habitat, the zoo also releases live fish for the bears to hunt like they would in the wild. An underwater viewing gallery allows you to see just how surprisingly graceful the great white furry beauties can be.
<strong><br />
Reptile Garden </strong>Featuring the endangered Komodo dragons outside of Indonesia as well as a selection of marmosets, iguanas and tortoises. If you enjoy cold-blooded animals, this is your Garden of Eden.
<br />
<strong>Bat Exhibit </strong><br />
Catch some of the world&#146;s largest and smallest bats within the same vicinity &#150; the Malayan flying fox, one of the largest bats in the world with a wingspan of up to 1.7m, and the tiny dogfaced fruit bat, weighing in just between 30 to 100 grams. The Bat Exhibit is located along the Mangrove Walk.
&#160;
<strong>Giant Flying Squirrel Exhibit</strong><br />
The Vietnamese giant flying squirrels are the new kids on the block, in addition to the red and white giant flying squirrels currently residing at their recently revamped habitat. Watch these creatures in action as they glide about 400m off the ground, and even more amazing are the females who are the proud owners of three pairs of mammaries.
<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Twice now, we&#146;ve been told by the staff at Spinelli Far East Square that the takeaway quiche we&#146;d ordered was vegetarian, only to find that it contained meat. If staff don&#146;t know what&#146;s in their products, they should say so. Or find out.&#160;

				<description><![CDATA[Restaurants stand or fall on one simple premise: consistently good food. The bells and whistles &#150; chandeliers, cutlery, glossy menus and starched table linen &#150; are welcome distractions, but not at the expense of the food. It&#146;s a simple reality that too many restaurants still fail to grasp. Because the more sensory hoopla a restaurant tries to pile on, the more pressure it puts on the kitchen to deliver the goods. Spring walks this tightrope awkwardly, teetering at times, but recovering its balance at crucial moments. The setting recalls a Crouching Tiger theme, with original 19th-century high walls, Chinese gabled roofs, an expansive courtyard and the whisper of history seeping from beneath the coat of fresh paint. Inside the two-storey house (sadly not the original, but rebuilt in the late 1990s), hardwood floors, a pastel palette, garish yellow tablecloths, and a mish-mash collection of stone horses and Chinese chaises are a somewhat bland background for Chef Lin Zhi&#146;s compact southern Chinese dishes. A quick scan of the menu reveals some intriguing items, including fried prawns marinated in Fuzhou tea, cumin flavoured lamb ribs and a pot of braised pigs trotters with duck, chicken and mushrooms. But what&#146;s annoying from the outset is how the staff tries to steer the diner away from these dishes and toward expensive items like lobster and geoduck clams. On one visit, the waitress calmly recommended the fatt tiew cheong (Buddha jumps over the wall - pictured above) at $98 a serving, when I&#146;d already indicated we just wanted a simple soup. We got soup anyway, as small complimentary bowls of clear, sweetish, salty consomm&#233; arrived at the table with a single, snowy-white fish ball floating decoratively in the midst. The fish paste was a little too soft for my taste, but the purity of the stock held promise for the rest of the meal. But here the kitchen&#146;s inconsistency is a little odd, because while some of the food was outstanding, the occasional dish showed carelessness and inattention at the stove; though I suspect the fault lies with the calibre of the line cooks. For instance, the bitter gourd soup &#150; a light and smooth jade pur&#233;e streaked with ribbons of egg white and tiny shreds of scallops &#150; won plaudits. It will not be to everyone&#146;s taste, but I loved its vividly green bitterness. Yet the kitchen that produced such a velvety, subtle soup was also responsible for stir-fried kailan overcooked to such an extent that the vegetables were reduced to dry husks, not even salvaged by the good oyster sauce. At $14 for around six sprigs, it was a very expensive failure. Equally disappointing were the siewmai from the small dim sum menu &#150; three rounds of over-steamed pastry, filled with bland pork and topped with a clump of what tasted like shredded dried scallops; and a stir-fried beef where the flavour of little spirals of thickly minced meat was completely overwhelmed by thickets of boring shredded lettuce. Just as I was beginning to get really nervous about the meal, along came the fried vegetarian bee hoon &#150; a perfectly moist, crystalline tumble of opaque threads, its white mass embedded with studs of green chives and slivers of carrots. It was a master class in technique, and proof, once again, of how extraordinarily satisfying a simple dish can be when done well. But the star attraction &#150; and a dish for which I would return again and again &#150; was the deep-fried spare ribs: lightly battered nuggets of pork, saut&#233;ed in a wonderfully gooey tomato-based marinade with pale hemispheres of crunchy chestnuts and a shower of chopped garlic. The result was first-rate comfort food that needed nothing more than a bowl of steamed rice and an appetite. With such highs, it&#146;s a pity so many other dishes didn&#146;t have the same impact.&#160;<em>(Fried rice with abalone in red vinasse pictured).</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Hotel bars aren&#146;t always just for tourists. Not called The Atrium for nothing, Pan Pacific Singapore boasts the highest indoor atrium in Asia, and was designed specifically so by architect John Portman. This contemporary space is decked out with sleek sofas, teak louvers and an ever-changing light show, while the spacious cabanas make for the perfect birthday/new job/engagement celebratory spot. Apart from the well-mixed drinks and the extensive tapas menu with delectable nibbles &#150; you can expect five-star service from the staff, who are more than happy to bring round the complimentary tapas (available only at limited times) and mixed nuts .]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[<br />
One of the unexpected pleasures of wandering around the maze of Lucky Plaza is that you sometimes stumble across an eatery like Minang House. Surrounded by a second-hand bag shop, a photo studio and a kitchen showroom, this hole in the wall draws an appreciative crowd of nasi padang fans &#150; the recipes come directly from Indonesia&#146;s Padang region. Stacked dishes brimming with signature spicy classics are displayed behind the glass counter: tongue-searing petai prawns, blackened grilled river fish, dengdeng balado (the beef&#146;s sweetness is courtesy of a long, slow cook in coconut water and chilli), and racks of ayam panggang (spicy grilled chicken) that usually sell out by the end of lunchtime. The menu varies a little each day, so depending on your luck, you could be digging into an assam fish-head curry on a Tuesday and perhaps a sambal brinjal on Wednesday. One major downside is the exhaust fan. It needs a lot of work, so be prepared to spend the afternoon smelling of your lunch.&#160;]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[At Booze wine shops, you are sure to find a comprehensive selection of premium wines across a range of prices. Their strengths lie in their French and German selections, but they also carry a good variety from Austria, Australia, the US and Spain, as well as Chile, Italy, South Africa and Portugal. They also have a fine range of Spiegelau wine glasses and decanters as well as wine fridges for sale. Every Friday night, for a low $20, you get to taste five wines of the month at Booze&#146;s Capital Tower outlet, which is great for those who want to try before they buy. <br />

				<description><![CDATA[There&#146;s something to be said for tucking into a rich, burgundy-hued Keralan fish curry while sitting on Mango Tree&#146;s bijou timber deck facing the beach: it&#146;s almost a scene straight out of a glossy travel magazine. Smallish portions aside, there&#146;s no faulting the kitchen&#146;s finesse, whether it&#146;s an extraordinary plate of prawns redolent with the scent of coconut, or tender nuggets of chicken in a lava-like tomato gravy. Pair it all with fluffy rice spiked with lemon, and a pile of aromatic butter naans.

				<description><![CDATA[It&#146;s a little lame to say, &#145;if you can&#146;t go to Bali, then bring Bali to you&#146; &#150; but hey, that&#146;s exactly what the owners of this quaint and idyllic restro-bar set out to do. Amidst the abundant shrubbery and willowy trees, there are rustic, Balinesestyle wooden pavilions with bale rooftops, which you can clamber into with friends, and pretend you are on an exotic getaway together. While the wait-staff are young and eager, they are also a little clueless at times, but when they finally bring the correct bottle of wine along with an impish grin, all is easily forgiven.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Yet another live-act venue, but this time with a Chinese twist. Exuding an oriental flavour, Lunar is decked out with iconic Asian elements, goldfish lanterns, handcrafted birdcages and contemporary Chinese pop artwork. This concept bar is spread across 15,000 square feet, and has a loft overlooking the central stage, where you&#146;ll occasionally see skinny Chinese girls prancing about doing song-and-dance routines. However, if you prefer looking at girls with a bit more meat on them, focus your attention on the ceiling, where you&#146;ll find, uh, some tasteful nude art to gaze upon while you sip your drinks (try the sake-based cocktails and martinis). Bottoms up, gentlemen.

You say &#145;teem-bre&#146;, I say &#145;tam-bre&#146; &#150; it doesn&#146;t matter how you pronounce the name of this establishment. It&#146;s your ability to appreciate the live music that counts. Though Timbre has opened its second location while simultaneously celebrating the second anniversary of the original Armenian Street venue, Timbre&#146;s new digs are undoubtedly more sophisticated, occupying what used to be Q Bar. The riverfront locale is breezy and picturesque, and the view of glittering Boat Quay serves as a nice backdrop for the stage. The nightly drink promotions are certainly attractive; however, on the night we went, the martini promotion came at the expense of the drink itself. Does moderately priced equal serving patrons a half-empty drink?&#160;

The Tuesday set, for instance, is a superb beef stew &#150; the meat fork-tender and perfumed with salty-sweet soy sauce, alongside a huge mound of mash, cauliflower and broccoli stir fried with garlic and perfectly grilled peppers. Side dishes include fried chicken wings served with a terrific mango and cucumber salsa; crisp spring rolls with fresh basil and mint; and intensely flavoured carrot and potato soups. A special delivery service to nearby offices, in tiffin containers, is offered to members.

				<description><![CDATA[Long ago, the Marmalade Group staked out the higher ground of casual Western meals, and it&#146;s never really let go of the prize. Its Toast outlet at Raffles Place is a hive of lunchtime activity, with a predominantly expat clientele. Daily specials keep things interesting, though we&#146;re always partial to the green soba noodles ($6.50) scented with sesameseed oil and enmeshed with crisp sugar snap peas and shiitake mushrooms. The wraps (around $7.50) are hefty rolls of imaginative fillings like spicy chicken, fresh mango and mint; though our recent roast chicken, roast peppers and Emmenthal combo could have done with a zesty relish. The home-made soups (from $5.50) come with a chunk of ciabatta. To finish, order one of the yummy lemon cupcakes ($3.70).&#160;

				<description><![CDATA[Simply Sandwich scores points for its smart packaging, and for the quantity and quality of their servings, though the fillings (roast chicken, tuna salad, ploughmans) evoke a sense of d&#233;j&#224; vu. The bread, invariably (but not always) softer, tastes fresher than most. For variety, order the triple packs ($8), which hold three triangles of thickly cut bread with fillings such as avocado, alfalfa and blue cheese (barely any in our order); cheese and chutney; chunky egg salad; poached salmon; very salty smoked salmon and thick lashings of cream cheese; and ham and cheese. The sandwiches come in different breads &#150; grains, rye and brown &#150; though we were hard-pressed to be able to distinguish between them.&#160;

				<description><![CDATA[One of a pair duking it out with <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/restaurants/western/pret-a-manger">Pret A Manger</a> (the other is <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/restaurants/western/simply-sandwich">Simply Sandwich</a>, just across the road) for supremacy on the same stretch, The Sandwich Shop offers a comprehensive takeaway menu that includes vegetarian sandwiches, breakfast sets and platters for large groups. The chicken tikka ($7) is almost always sold out. Our ham and Brie baguette ($7.50) was clammy and dry thanks to its stint in the chiller (a fate common to many of the sandwiches we tried, so when ordering, insist on fresh portions that aren&#146;t swiped from the chiller). Rather good was the Club TSS ($7.90) &#150; a chunk of onion bread embracing salad, large cuts of hard-boiled eggs and bacon strips. We were stumped by the chicken satay salad ($6.50). The generous tiles of moist, curry-flavoured chicken, crushed peanuts, tinned pineapple slices and leaves, we understood &#150; but what does lemon mayonnaise have to do with satay?&#160;

				<description><![CDATA[Fish &#38; Co. has an extensive takeaway selection of seafood-based dishes like pasta and paella, but only a few are available for delivery. These tend to be fried and not done very well at all. The fish in our New York Fish and Chips dish was a massive, but tasteless, filet of fish ($14.90), and the fried batter looked like the burnt pockmarked surface of the moon. Optimistically described as &#145;the best fish and chips in town&#146;, it wasn&#146;t. Worse, the accompanying cheese sauce (which we guess is what made it a New York Fish and Chips) had split, leaving an unappetising layer of fat floating at the top of the container. The calamari rings (free with an order of two drinks) were soggy and bland, and the Fisherman&#146;s Combo ($18.90 for fish, calamari, prawns and chips) was underwhelming.&#160;

				<description><![CDATA[Of the many lunches we covered, Bakerzin was one of the weakest. The portions, though tasty enough, were miserly and expensive. A Styrofoam cup of bland (and barely warm) pumpkin soup cost $6.80, while a small portion of linguini with spicy bratwurst cost an astonishing $14.80. The mushroom bruschetta ($9.80) had a decent heap of mushrooms, but the bread wasn&#146;t toasted; while the otah bruschetta ($9.80) was toasted but the topping was paper-thin. The steak and mushroom sandwich ($13.80) would have been great were it not for the fact that the bread was of the soft, fluffy, white variety when a rye or sourdough was called for.&#160;

&#160;
Full marks to Wine Garage for putting on one of the few organic and planet-friendly weekend breakfasts in town. Of course, this means the prices are a little heftier (including a $19 fruit platter with rosemary- infused honey and yoghurt), but the quality of the ingredients is beyond reproach. Plus, there&#146;s no price tag on how virtuous you&#146;ll feel as you savour poached organic eggs ($20.90), swirled through with torn chunks of fennel sausages and wilted spinach. Especially good are the buttermilk pancakes ($19.80) topped with blueberry compote and tart kumquat butter, and the poached egg over polenta ($19). The kids have their own special menu, including egg with hash browns ($8) and French toast with mango ($9).

				<description><![CDATA[There&#146;s something so casually chirpy, upbeat and authentic about New York New York (so authentic, in fact, they named it twice and plonked down a pool table in the middle of the restaurant) that you understand why the lunch and dinner queues are so long. The all-day breakfast is great value and very well executed. Highlights include the yummy cheese-steak muffin (layers of beef stacked on crisp muffins and smothered with salty processed cheese with a side of crunchy chips, $6.90), pancakes (a not-so-filling serving of two small, fluffy rounds with butter and maple syrup, $5.90), and corned beef hash ($7.90) &#150; from a tin, the helpful staff advised us &#150; served with saut&#233;ed onions and a sunny-side-up egg.

				<description><![CDATA[There&#146;s such a charming Sydney vibe about Graze. Its bucolic location in a black-and-white bungalow in Rochester Park is a plus, as is the vastly improved service. The breakfast menu is wideranging, from eggs done to your liking and muesli to freshly squeezed fruit juices and inch-thick toast. But the star attraction is the fry-up ($18), here served in a castiron pan crowded with fat bratwurst, saut&#233;ed mushrooms, sunny-side-up eggs, baked beans and nicely oily bacon. Thoughtfully, a vegetarian version is also available. The few low notes were banana pancakes overwhelmed by the red currant sauce ($13), expensive mojitos ($18) that needed a lot more alcohol and none-too-clean men&#146;s toilets.&#160;

				<description><![CDATA[Who serves up prawn cocktails these days, let alone T-bone steak, chips and peas? Well, Colbar does, and loyal fans love them for it. The place, looking for all the world like a glorified tin shed, is locked in a time warp (circa 1956), and that&#146;s just fine with us. The cooking isn&#146;t great &#150; on a recent visit, the poached eggs ($5.50) were the texture of cotton wool, and the sausages ($9) a touch mealy, accompanied by wooden chips &#150; but it&#146;s all cheap and good, and just what the doctor ordered after a hard night&#146;s partying. At our breakfast, the next table cracked open a bottle of beer to go with their omelette &#150; it&#146;s that kind of place. Word to the wise: there&#146;s no air-conditioning, just lazy ceiling fans, so be prepared to shvitz a little when it&#146;s warm outside.

				<description><![CDATA[Unexpectedly, Cedele served up an excellent breakfast. Unexpected because we still tend to think of it as a cake joint. But the servings are quite large and at $11.50, it&#146;s hard to complain about the Hot Breakfast of eggs, toast and a choice of bacon, mushrooms and sausages. Most of the options offer variations of the same combination, with extras costing, well, extra &#150; we paid $1 for one teensy-weensy bacon strip. The rosti comprises two small tiles of potato wedges, but the side servings of eggs and mushrooms turn it into a hefty meal ($12.90). But what really bowled us over were the airy apple cinnamon pancakes (with actual saut&#233;ed apples embedded in the batter), served with bacon or sausages, wild blueberries and vanilla butter ($10.90). Service is still rather lacklustre: the wait-staff tend to congregate at the kitchen counter, either not seeing our frantically waving hands, or with their backs to the room. But for a breakfast spread this satisfying, we&#146;ll also turn a blind eye.

				<description><![CDATA[The Tree Top Walk at <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/aroundtown/venues/Walks-tours/macritchie-reservoir">MacRitchie Reservoir</a> takes you through the different stages of a mature secondary forest. It&#146;s the first of its kind in Singapore and South-East Asia. The bridge part rises as high as 27 metres, and you can see as many as 80 bird and eight reptile varieties, and 18 rare species of trees. <a href="http://www.nparks.gov.sg/nature_central_treetops.asp">National Parks Board</a> calls it one of the best hiking routes, but be sure to wear the right shoes; it&#146;s graded moderate-to-difficult. Getting to the bridge, and walking it and back is a 10.5km journey. And, oh, beware of falling branches &#150; a man was killed by one earlier this year after a heavy rainfall.&#160;

Raj is always a hive of activity, dishing out substantial, well-priced portions of simply done but delicious curries, dosai and <em>rava masalas</em> (semolina cr&#234;pes). The <em>idlis</em> (doughy, nutty patties) are particularly good, as are the smoky cubes of paneer aachari draped with a heavy pink shower of raw onions. The ghee rava masala is a giant serving, the cr&#234;pe enveloping potato curry and strewn with peppercorns and saut&#233;ed onions. Pair it all with a rich, coconut-infused brinjal korma.

The regular crowd of elderly folk, couples and young families enjoy extraordinary soups, especially the wild mushrooms served in a young coconut, and a thick morass of spinach and seaweed. The fragrantly fried brown rice with olives surpasses expectations while the modest- looking crumbed button mushrooms, wrapped with shiso leaves, are pure heaven.

After about 10pm, &#34;The Four Floors of Whores&#34; really gets busy. Although we have never been there ourselves (yeah right - Ed) we are told by others that FFW is an almost delightful parody of itself and well worth a visit if you have brought your sense of humour.
In the quieter tower at the back there's a <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Bars/harrys-at-orchard-towers">Harry's</a> bar but even this has a higher ratio of ladies to men that you might usually expect in a pub. <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Bars/ipanema-orchard-towers">Ipanema</a> is the most mainstream and is a pretty good bar - it is always busy and&#160;the live bands rock all night long.
Other venues in the complex include <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Bars/ba-li-ba-orchard-towers">Ba Li Ba</a>, <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Bars/bongo-bar-orchard-towers">Bongo Bar</a>, <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Club/club-romeo-orchard-towers">Club Romeo</a>, <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Bars/country-jamboree-orchard-towers">Country Jamboree</a>, <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Bars/crazy-horse-orchard-towers">Crazy Horse</a>, <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Bars/naughty-girl-orchard-towers">Naughty Girl</a> and <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Club/top-5-orchard-towers">Top 5</a>.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Located at the junction of Upper Pickering Street and South Bridge Road, Hong Lim Park is Singapore&#146;s designated area for free speech, where you can say anything you like: against the government, the PAP or Lee Kuan Yew, with no consequences. However, there are still some rules; we are in S&#146;pore after all. You can&#146;t just go up and talk when you feel like it. You have to register at the nearby police post and (surprise, surprise), no amplifiers or mic systems of any sort are allowed &#150; and with the din of the traffic, it&#146;s nearly impossible to be heard (so you can forget about mass rallies). It might still be worth popping by for a look at night, because, as a bit of side history, it used to be the area for cruising. Even nowadays, you might still see the occasional guy looking for some, uh, inspiration.&#160;]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Changi Airport terminals 1 and 2 feel like a 1970s hotel lobby with plush carpets and too much beige, but it is the most efficient 1970s hotel lobby in the world.
See our feature about Terminal 3 - <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/aroundtown/feature/terminally-hip">Terminally Hip</a>.
Changi allows Singaporeans to live life differently - visitors to Singapore regularly make the mistake of arriving for flights 2 hours early when locals know that from taxi stand to the gate is really only 15 minutes. Arriving in Singapore is so different to other major hubs such as London Heathrow - Changi will have you out and on the road whilst at Heathrow your luggage is still sitting in the rain on the tarmac.
Changi is also rumoured to hold the world record for most cabs available at an airport - a queue of thousands always snakes into the distance. It will cost around $15 to get downtown compared to $150+ from Heathrow.
Local tips:
- Mercedes limousines are $35 fixed fee to anywhere in Singapore - you only need to take one of these when you are going a long way during rush hour.
- Always stock up on Fox's glacier mints and fruits at immigration. Especially when you are meeting people after a long haul.
- <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Bars/harrys-at-changi-airport-t1">Harry's</a> has a great outdoor bar at T1.
- There is a swimming pool in Terminal 1 (also accessible from other Terminals) for transit passangers so if travelling to Australia or UK and laying over for a few hours pack your swimmers in your hand luggage, a S$13.90 fee is payable for use of the swimming pool which includes showers, towel and a complimentary non-alcoholic drink from the well stocked bar. (No one ever believes us on this! <a href="http://www.changiairport.com/changi/en/airport_guide/exp_changi/rest_n_relax/swimming_pool.html">Click if you don't</a>.)]]></description>

There is almost too much to do, despite its puny size: a spice garden, a replica of the first botanical garden set up by Sir Stamford Raffles, gothic-looking gates that mark the entrance into the park, old Christian graves, underground bunkers used during World War II (<a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/aroundtown/venues/Museums/the-battle-box">Battle Box</a>) and an ongoing archaeological excavation site. The Registry of Marriages is also nearby, so expect to see many newlywed couples perspiring in&#160;their ridiculously hot suits.

				<description><![CDATA[This top-notch attraction contains 8,000 birds from 600 species. There&#146;s a multitude of exotic and endangered South-east Asian species, alongside pelicans, penguins, flamingoes, ibises, swans, toucans, birds of paradise &#150; and more. Key attractions include the largest walk-in aviary in the world, where you&#146;ll find a 30m (98ft) man-made waterfall and 1,500 birds from Africa and South America flying freely within the huge compound. After a $10m revamp in 2006, the park now has a exhibit modelled on the Okvango River in Botswana, complete with storks, cranes, fish, frogs and African-style huts. Bird shows and feeding sessions take place throughout the day. Joint tickets for the BirdPark, Night Safari and Zoo ($40; $20 children) are available.&#160;
&#160;

<strong></strong>
&#160;
Things To See
&#160;
<strong>African Waterfall Aviary</strong><br />
<em>Daily; 9am-6pm</em><br />
A more holistic African experience is now on offer within a simulated tropical rainforest. With a 35m-high net ceiling, 1,500 African birds have more space to roam, but they&#146;re not the only animals reaping the benefits of a renovation. Enjoy a spanking new suspension bridge, observation posts and the new African hut for all your ornithological conquests.
&#160;
<strong>African Wetlands Exhibit </strong><br />
<em>Daily; 9am-6pm </em><br />
A simulation of the St Lucia Wetlands in South Africa, this replica reflects the balanced wildlife ecology at its original site, allowing African birds like shoebills, crowned cranes and saddle-billed storks to grow accustomed to living in this part of the world.
&#160;
<strong>Early Bird Breakfast Show</strong><br />
<em>Daily; 8.30-11am (breakfast), 9.15-9.45am (show)</em><br />
<em>Various prices (breakfast), free (show).</em><br />
They say the early bird gets the worm, and you just might want to let them have it at this interactive breakfast. Instead, you can choose from a variety of delectable dishes off the Bongo Burgers Terrace menu while you make new feathered friends like Big John, the park&#146;s oldest cockatoo, and Merlin, a yellow-naped Amazon who tells fortunes.
&#160;
<strong>Birds of Prey Show</strong><br />
<em>Daily; 10am (Fuji World of Hawks), 4pm (Kings of the Skies)</em><br />
Not only are they ferocious flying predators, these birds are also very disciplined. Watch the turkey vulture swoop past your ear, the Himalayan griffon vulture climb up a tree and the Brahminy kite eat from chopsticks (Fuji Hawk Walk).
&#160;
<strong>Feeding Frenzy</strong><br />
<em>Daily; 10.30am &#38; 2.30pm (Bee-Eater and Starlings), 10.30am &#38; 3.30pm (Penguins), 2pm (Pelicans)</em><br />
Birds (like Singaporeans) are at their happiest when eating. Time your visit to the park and you&#146;ll get to see a variety of birds catching their meals &#150; literally (Waterfall Aviary, Penguin Expedition, Pelican Cove).]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[
&#160;
This wetland reserve of mangrove swamps, ponds and secondary forest is home to 140 species of birds. Thousands of egrets, sandpipers and plovers pass through in winter, but plenty of local species (kingfishers, herons, bitterns) are visible all year round. Early morning is the best time for birdwatching; there are observation hides, and you can rent binoculars. There are three nature trails (3-7km/2-4 miles long), and you can also spot mudskippers, monkeys and climbing crabs on the mangrove boardwalks. Free guided tours are available on Saturday (9.30am, 3.30pm). On Sundays the 925 bus stops at the entrance; the rest of the week you have to walk from Kranji Reservoir car park &#150; either via Kranji Way and Neo Tiew Crescent, or via the rugged and longer Kranji Nature Trail. Alternatively, you can catch the Kranji Express bus.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Now with five outlets across the island, this popular Hong Kong foodie joint is really on a roll. The menu has over 300 items (really) including the fancy-looking &#145;8 Treasures Soup&#146;, traditional Hong Kong street snacks (condensed milk on toast is just one of them) and double-boiled bird&#146;s nest. There&#146;s even Western fare like burgers and sandwiches. At the Zion Rd outlet, a giant plasma TV takes up most of the wall space so you can enjoy old Hong Kong action flicks over your meal.

				<description><![CDATA[Take wining and dining to new heights at Mount Faber&#146;s crown&#133;er, jewel. Owned and operated by the Mount Faber Leisure Group, the award-winning Jewel Box is an F&#38;B/entertainment complex that includes the stunning Glass Bar, Faber Rock, Altivo and the Faber Hill Bistro. In fine weather, Bistro patrons can supposedly catch a glimpse of neighbouring islands like Bintan and Batam, while Glass Bar customers can admire an unobstructed view of the harbour. Jewel Box&#146;s other claim to fame? It&#146;s the only local fine-dining establishment accessible via cable car. It&#146;s even been credited as having the world&#146;s best toilet, which should make you curious as to what the best toilet in the world looks like.

				<description><![CDATA[Styled as a midtown Manhattan bar, The Living Room is located smack in the middle of prime Orchard Road real estate at the Marriott Hotel. Though one might not expect to see a fireplace in the tropics, there&#146;s a (fake) one here to help you imagine you&#146;re seeking boozy shelter from a blizzard. The interior might look a little stiff, but musical regulars like DJ Samurai help to warm up the atmosphere. Big plus: no cover charge &#150; but do remember that the age requirements are hiked up. If you&#146;re looking to re-enact true Big Apple behaviour, make use of the Marriott&#146;s posh valet service. Just remember: we don&#146;t tip here.

				<description><![CDATA[Samar Cafe is an authentic piece of the Middle East in Singapore - the service can be bad, the food is not the main attraction and you cannot buy alcohol. If you do not want to sit on the floor then you should definitely mention that&#160;you want a table when you book. The music and atmosphere here is the u.s.p. - if you have never seen an authentic Middle Eastern band live then you must go to Samar soon.

				<description><![CDATA[If you&#146;re a sucker for old tomes and &#145;vintage&#146; magazines, this is the place for you. There&#146;s a $1 clearance bin just begging for a good ransacking and classic literature going for prices as low as five bucks. You might have to spend a little more time going through the shelves and various discount piles to find what you want, but at such low rates, it&#146;s worth the effort. Thankfully this place is not too old-school &#150; they accept credit cards, which is good news for big spenders.

Drop by Yong He to try its specialities: beancurd, and you tiao (deep-fried dough) with floss &#150; the latter can be eaten plain, dipped in soybean milk or vinegar (don&#146;t knock it before you try it). Since it&#146;s open 24 hours, it&#146;s a popular supper place for both people-watching and straight-up feasting.

				<description><![CDATA[
&#160;
Set in lush secondary rainforest, this is a must-see. The world&#146;s first night zoo (opened in 1991) allows you to see what over 900 nocturnal animals from 130 species get up to after dusk, in naturalistic habitats and without barriers, via the use of special lighting techniques.
&#160;
To see the zoo, take a 45-minute tram ride: observe majestic lions gnawing on their meat dinners, coy mountain deer striking poses and, if you&#146;re lucky, a noisy rhino taking a bath. You can get off the tram at designated points to follow three walking trails that let you get close to flying squirrels, dangling bats and a leopard or two.
&#160;
The hourly Creatures of the Night show is worth a look, but the ethnic performances are a bit lame. Don&#146;t use flash if you&#146;re taking photos as it may scare the animals. The Night Safari gets a million visitors a year, most of whom seem to turn up at the weekend; go late at night during the week to have a quieter time.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[A huge new Friday-night hit among Singapore&#146;s three Ms (models, media types and the moneyed), restaurant-cum-bar Mimolette is tucked within the Turf Club off Bukit Timah (not far from Sixth Avenue). The colonial-house venue and its tropical-greenery surrounds make for an exotic and exclusive setting &#150; though one can&#146;t help feeling for the stabled horses nearby; the late-night outdoor disco&#146;s pounding R&#38;B numbers must interfere with their sleep. Visit the restaurant for brunch, lunch or dinner, and expect New American-meets-French fare. Executive chef Kelvin Lee has an impressive CV with stints at 3-star Michelin restaurants in France and top regional establishments, though initial reports from disgruntled diners to <em>TOS</em> staffers have pointed to cuisine being &#145;overpriced and ordinary&#146;.  <br />

				<description><![CDATA[In the day, the glass box that is Rogues glistens like a jewel amid the concrete high-rises. It&#146;s an oasis to the many who peer down longingly at it from their office windows through the course of the day, waiting until dusk falls so they can finally zip down for a much needed after-work tipple. The interior is warm and classy, half-occupied by dining tables with plush armchairs, and half by an impressive-looking bar lined with stylish stools. If you&#146;re the type who prefers an alfresco environment, the rooftop bar offers a wooden deck and casual setting. Here, you can sprawl out on the wooden seats that are covered with generously proportioned cushions and people-watch as you sip on your beautiful brown brew or a potent cocktail. If you&#146;re feeling hungry, the well-priced ($12 for a sandwich) and well-prepared Australian-influenced menu should provide some sustenance. Upstairs is the outdoor bar, <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Bars/something">Something</a>.

				<description><![CDATA[You never have to worry about your beer going lukewarm at Eski Bar because, as the name suggests, the place (a converted 750-square foot industrial freezer) is so cold, the staff go about their duties wearing thick overcoats. But when the novelty of having misty breath wears out, or when your skinny ass can no longer tolerate the coldness (whichever comes first), it&#146;s the booze that will keep you going. The menu of Grey Goose vodka-based cocktails, such as Snowflakes and Eski Mojo, and vodka shots delivered straight from pistols by the Eski Angels will keep you feeling all warm and fuzzy.]]></description>

Part-restaurant, part-caf&#233; and part-spa, <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/wellandgood/venues/spa/house">House</a> also, erm, houses Camp, a bar that, contrary to what you may think, is neither targeted specifically at the limp wristed nor military men. The name does, however, reference the fact the building used to be an army barracks, but you&#146;d never know looking at it now. The interior is quirkily decorated with exposed brick and concrete beams, and lighting wires hanging off the ceiling, and boasts eight function rooms with unusual names such as Kubrick, which you can reserve for your own private party. There&#146;s nothing artificial about CAMP&#146;s new cocktail menu &#150; fresh from mixology boot camp under the watchful eye of Melbourne-based bar whiz Matthew Bax. Bottled juices and cream-based concoctions are a no-no; at CAMP it&#146;s all handpressed juice and only the finest spirits like Havana Club rum and Mumm champagne. For larger parties we suggest Group Therapy &#150; both the Prohibition Long Island Iced Tea Party ($55), a potent brew that comes in a beautiful Chinese teapot, and Tiffin Punch ($59) &#150; a new twist on an old Parisian cocktail, delightfully refreshing and enough for four. Alternatively, bring out the inner hobo with a swig of Jamaican Black Strap Buck.]]></description>

				<title>Swissotel The Stamford</title>

				<guid>http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/xmlapi/xml_detail/?venue=862&amp;key=ffab6a24c60f562ecf705130a36c1d1e</guid>
				<description><![CDATA[Designed by IMPei, the legendary modernist architect, Swissotel The Stamford is a behemoth, comprising 72 storeys and over 1,261 rooms, along with 16 bars and restaurants, a helipad and its own entrance to City Hall MRT station. A popular choice with flight crews and big tour groups, it has an air of hustle and bustle.
&#160;
The rooms are nothing to write home about &#150; especially those on the lower levels &#150; though the upper floors provide spectacular views from the balconies. The Stamford is part of the same complex as sister hotel <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/tourists/venues/hotels/raffles-the-plaza">Fairmont Singapore</a>, and shopping centre <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/music/venues/general/raffles-city-shopping-centre">Raffles City</a>.
&#160;
On a clear day, Swiss&#244;tel The Stamford offers a breathtaking of the Singapore's skylines. The views are reserved for paying patrons of the bars and restaurants on the 69th to 72nd floors &#150; but you can take the elevator up on the pretext of going to have a drink and see a portion of the view in the lobby area outside the lift.
&#160;
The best times to steal a glance are on weekday afternoons; any other time, and especially on Fridays and Saturdays, they usually put a cover-charge booth on the first floor. It is a painful $25 for entry and a drink at <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Bars/new-asia-bar">New Asia Bar</a> on the 71st floor, so don&#146;t say we didn&#146;t warn you.

				<description><![CDATA[This quiet, leafy hideaway with handsome horses and swaggering riders on parade has dropped some cash recently to upgrade the facilities. We do like the cosmetic changes although menu prices have been upped a bit and some of our favourites have gone from the menu (hands-up who misses the vegetable curry with prata?). Still the menu offers a good variety, reasonably well executed &#150; the fish and chips are always a fresh treat and the nasi lemak is tasty. Avoid the chicken rice and laksa which are both bland disappointments.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[If the scents of conventional perfumes are wearing you down, be sure to check out Jamal Kazura Aromatics. With glass shelves lined with jars of clear and coloured natural oils &#150; sourced from all across the globe, including the Middle- East, India and Europe &#150; this intimate fragrance boutique offers a wide range of attars (Arabic perfumes), Egyptian perfume vials, massage oils, scented body soaps and shower creams. First opened in the 1920s at North Bridge Road by the late Hinifa Kazura, Jamal Kazura Aromatics, with two other outlets, is now managed by his grandson Johari. Ask about customising your own signature scent &#150; Kazura will bring you a questionnaire asking after your favourite smells (citrus, floral, spicy, musky, etc&#133;), what type of occasion you&#146;re wearing the perfume for, and then proceed to select different scents to blend until you&#146;re satisfied. Bottled in 12ml vials ($30-$80), these are usually combinations of five or more oils mixed and shaken in a bottle. Custom-blended scents are also available ready-made; one popular choice is the Bella Rose, a long-lasting floral scent that starts off with citrus notes.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[In a town where it feels like a new Italian joint opens every day, it&#146;s easy to overlook the more established outlets. The seven-year-old Senso is one place that continues to impress with its contemporary menu and exemplary service. On a recent visit, we quickly forgot about the wrong order arriving at our table &#150; a roast balsamico cod instead of grilled pesto sea bass &#150; by the seamless way that, within seconds, the unwanted fish was whisked away and replaced with a complimentary glass of wine. The Sunday brunch spread ($78) is accompanied by free-flow Italian Prosecco.
Senso expands its (delicious) horizons, opening a new outlet on Raffles Avenue in addition to its original home on Club Street. Before getting on the Flyer, try its margherita pizza &#150; a refreshingly simple take on an Italian classic &#150; and finish with a <em>real </em>latte. <em>Pizza from $18, mains from $24.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The first thing that hits you as you enter Mario&#146;s small space is the heady waft of yeast from freshly baked dough (though it&#146;s a little unfortunate that the badly ventilated open kitchen also leaves you smelling of your dinner - to avoid this you can eat in the al fresco dining area). The thin-crust pizzas are made to order, while the pastas are handmade. Don&#146;t miss the chewy crumbed fried mozzarella sticks; creamy spaghetti carbonara; and wondrously fragrant thick pasta loops tangled with roughly torn chunks of pork sausages. Even the cr&#232;me br&#251;l&#233;e rises above the rest with a hit of lemon and toasted pine nuts. The regulars streaming in to pick up their takeaway boxes of pizzas tell the story.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Serangoon may be a bit of a hike for some, but we&#146;ll go far for authentic Indonesian chow, chai-beng style. Prima Rasa takes up a little corner of a block of HDB suburban shops, but behind its glassed-off counter is a treasure trove of brilliantly executed dishes, including sweet-and-sour fish that&#146;s neither soggy nor cloyingly sweet; curry chicken swathed in a turmeric-scented golden gravy; and sambal kangkong with just the right amount of bite and chilli heat. Even the humble omelette is especially fluffy and fragrant with caramelised onions. Bonus: if you don&#146;t do au naturel dining, there&#146;s an air conditioned room to the side.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Its dull name, innocuous signage and blink-and-miss-it location are all forgotten when you sink your teeth into the <em>dum ki raan</em>, a rich, velvety hunk of lamb braised in garlic, malt vinegar and garam masala. Indeed, it says something that in a dining room crowded with huge mirrors, gilt sconces and gaudy gold walls, the north-western Indian menu &#150; stuffed with kebabs and tandoor items &#150; still manages to shine brightest. The yellow lentil dhal is delicately perfumed with onions and tomato; the saffron-hued tandoori pomfret is all snowy-fleshed and crisp-skinned; and the buttery garlic naans and mint-flecked parathas are just the thing to mop up the yummy sauces.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Ma Maison &#150; all timber panelling and faux Tiffany table lamps &#150; is a hit among the new restaurants crowding The Central. The garlic bread is a thick slab of crisp baguette with just the right amount of butter and garlic, while the novel-sized cut of sirloin steak is cooked exactly as ordered (an unusual occurrence in this town). A highlight is the huge mound of garlicky, buttery rice blanketed by a lava flow of perfectly prepared omelette, the entire concoction sitting on a shallow pool of intensely beefy stroganoff. Bookings are essential on weekends.]]></description>

So what&#146;s so special about this place? It certainly isn&#146;t the decor (standard coffee-shop plastic). Or the setting (on Geylang&#146;s &#145;busy&#146; streets). And it isn&#146;t the service (waiting times sometimes stretch to hours). What&#146;s so special is chef Danny Lee&#146;s wildly popular Sri Lankan crab bee hoon (prepared one dish at a time); his juicy Chinese escargots accompanied by an addictive chilli dip; and meaty prawns steamed with garlic and chilli.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[We can do little except applaud the Crystal Jade group for consistently delivering high-quality Chinese comfort food. The daily dim sum selection is always reliable, including fluffy, crisp yam puffs and delicately wrought har gao. The beef brisket noodles recall the best of Hong Kong&#146;s caf&#233;s. Congees are a house specialty &#150; huge bowls of snowy rice soups paired with everything from creamy century eggs to livers and kidneys. The roast meats &#150; including crackling skinned suckling pigs and thick, lightly salted, fatty tiles of roast pork &#150; are perfect accompaniments.]]></description>

One of these, Old Chang Kee Take 5, serves up local favourites in large quantities and at ridiculous prices &#150; like the not-too-creamy laksa, fragrant curry chicken and perfectly crisp chicken wings.

				<description><![CDATA[It&#146;s no surprise that the compact menu is almost exclusively meat-based. The steaks are cooked and served on fragrant oak planks &#150; a technique favoured by South Americans and apparently the first of its kind in Singapore &#150; and accompanied by grilled vegetables and fries. With the most expensive item on the menu being the filet mignon &#150; $36 for a 160g slab and $42 for the 220g cut &#150; expect a fairly substantial meal that won&#146;t have you thinking nervously of your wallet the way an outing to <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/restaurants/Modern/mortons">Morton&#146;s</a> does. The mushroom linguine, of all things, is unexpectedly good.

Plan your meal around a carb-based dish like a pile of darkhued naan, flecked with mint, or a biryani. Pair the carbs with a coconut-infused Keralan fish curry; Lucknawi Burra kebab &#150; meaty lamb chops, marinated and cooked in a thick crimson gravy of tomatoes and ginger; and Ajwaini Machli tikka &#150; thick fish cubes, spiced and lashed with lemon before being plunged into a hot tandoor oven.]]></description>

There&#146;s slowroasted shredded pork, crisp pork crackle and a sweet potato sandwich drizzled with barbecue sauce; lychee and sage freeze; a Chinese Caesar salad of ginger poached chicken, sesame soy dressing and dark soya-braised eggs; and a silky shiitake mushroom fennel soup.

				<description><![CDATA[You may or may not choose to believe fans who claim this is one of the best Italian eateries in town, but there&#146;s no denying the calibre of the cooking. It begins with the fluffy, cheese-filled souffl&#233; bread and continues through a menu of pastas, seafood and meats. Marquee attractions include pink salmon wrapped around a tian of sweet crabmeat, a nicely peppered and perfectly seared cod, and excellent basil-infused angel hair showered with chunks of lobster meat. The chocolate fondant is a lush, bittersweet foil for the rum ice cream.

The inasal na manok is grilled to a mahogany char, its flesh sweetened by a marinade of garlic, lemongrass, calamansi, coconut vinegar and ginger, and its skin basted with annatto oil (a peppery, sweet infusion of annatto, a Filipino spice), bay leaves and garlic. The ensaladang talong is particularly outstanding: wondrously smoky strips of grilled eggplant, drenched with a mix of sharp coconut vinegar and raw, crushed garlic. Easily the next best thing to schlepping to Manila.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The highlight of this privately owned orchid garden, established in 1951, is the stunning view of an orchid-filled hillside. Over 200 varieties, including the national flower Vanda Miss Joachim, are cultivated here, and its gift-wrapped orchids are cheaper than in the city centre. But it&#146;s probably only worth a trip if you&#146;re a keen horticulturist or also visiting nearby Singapore Zoo.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Popular with photographers and wedding couples, this tranquil garden has a good bonsai collection, and various pavilions and pagodas in the northern Chinese imperial style. The best times to visit are during Chinese New Year (usually January or February) and the Mid-Autumn Festival (September or October), when cultural performances are held and the gardens are lit up at night like a fairyland by hundreds of beautiful and ornate paper lanterns. Don&#146;t miss the unusual Live Turtle &#38; Tortoise Museum, containing 180 turtles and more than 3,000 turtle-related items collected by the museum&#146;s owner and his daughter. The adjoining Japanese Gardens are currently undergoing renovation and should reopen some time in 2007.
Turtle &#38; Tortoise Museum $5. No credit cards.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Established in 1852, the Gardens are a tranquil respite from the city buzz. Highlights include the National Orchid Garden with the world&#146;s largest collection of orchids &#150; some 1,000 species and 2,000 hybrids, including the national flower, Vanda Miss Joaquim. There is also a swan lake where visitors can feed the black Australian swans, and the Evolution Garden Walk, a well-landscaped plot containing the fossilised remains of ancient trees. During weekends, tours to its rainforest patch are available, while outdoor concerts are often held at Symphony Lake.
Botanic Gardens were included in our recent <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/aroundtown/feature/one-night-stand">One Night Stand</a> feature.

				<description><![CDATA[Sun&#146;s high ceilings, stonework, steel finishes and woodsy trims are a slick background for the unfussy, bang-for-your-buck Japanese menu. The restaurant is making a name for its unusual seasonal offerings, such as vegetables from Kyoto and seafood from Hokkaido, though these are usually available only at dinner. For lunch, set-menu favourites include the fried chicken nuggets and broiled salmon set, and the tempura, tofu and salad set. We're also partial to&#160;the maguro avocado maki,&#160;here presented in a translucent sheet of rice paper,&#160;and the delicious juice made from Kyoho grapes]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[At the Singapore Indoor Stadium, with views of the Kallang River and some of Singapore&#146;s most coveted high-rise living, Brewerkz Bar &#38; Grill&#146;s spacious alfresco dining area is ideal for chilling out with one of their famous handcrafted beers and pizzas made on-site in the wood-burning oven &#150; the latter is unique to this outlet. The place fills up every evening, so make sure you stake out a spot early.

				<description><![CDATA[With the new non-smoking regulations, this indoor shisha lounge bar has sadly become just a lounge bar. The shishas that used to take centre-stage have been cast aside and now line the passageway enroute to the toilets. Thankfully, the bar has retained some charm, with its contemporary, earthy d&#233;cor and plush sofas. While the early evening has a mellow world music selection, the beat picks up around the midnight hour with lively bhangra remixes. The clientele is mostly local and foreign Indians looking to let loose with their buddies on the dancefloor, and the convivial atmosphere is fun and infectious, no doubt aided by the decently mixed drinks. Party animals with an appetite can head to Shisha&#146;s sister, the Ivory Kitchen, right next door, where a menu of delectable north Indian tapas keeps hunger pangs at bay. Try the chicken tikka, crispy cheese tikka patties and crispy lamb rolls. For once, it might be recommended that you head out for the night on an empty stomach.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[If you happen to be in your Sunday best and desire an evening cocktail in swish surroundings, you might want to stop by MezeBar. On the flip side, please note that this is certainly not a place to go if you are dressed in, say, sandals and a Tin Tin cartoon T-shirt. Warmly furnished with designer armchairs, velvety cushions and a dim-but-not-too-dark interior, MezeBar oozes sophistication. In fact, the waitresses are all decked out in slinky, well tailored cheongsams, which speaks volumes of the attention to detail here. Apart from the cocktails, which are their own interpretations of some of the more popular classic signatures (meaning: daringly up-sized andup-priced at $25), the Asian Tapas, such as the crispy tempura prawns, are quite tasty. Music-wise, different live bands play throughout the week so prepare to be serenaded.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[J Bar is a bit of an undiscovered gem. In line with the hotel&#146;s sleek style, the bar is one of the more contemporary-looking watering holes in the Shenton Way area. While it&#146;s mostly hotel guests who stumble upon it, there are some after-work regulars who stop by for a wind-down drink with colleagues or a casual meeting with business partners. If you have a weakness for acoustic music, there is a local band that performs from 8.30pm every day. And if you decide you want some air, step outside into the smallish outdoor balcony lined with over-stuffed PVC-wrapped couches, where you can sip a cocktail, smoke a cigarette, and peer down at the street below &#150; which, by sundown, should be devoid of office drones.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Stepping into this spanking-new club, you can&#146;t help but think that it resembles a lavish karaoke lounge or hostess-style nightclub. Its glossy black walls and equally glossy black floors reek of snobbery and you half expect a perfectly coiffed mamasan to come greet you and lead you by the hand to some plush booth where girls await. But that&#146;s not the sort of place this is, despite appearances. Rather, at 10,000 sq ft,it&#146;s touted as Singapore&#146;s largest international live music venue. This behemoth will focus on international acts from the United States, Britain and Australia on its two-month rotating playbill.&#160;<br />

Music nerds are more than welcome, as the resident DJs play a raw mix of deep jazz, soul, funk, hip hop and electro house.

Overall it&#146;s a bit of a muddle; the best displays include stirring footage of the Japanese Surrender in 1945, events leading to the independence of Singapore in 1965, and the displays showcasing various ethnic cultures and traditions (ugly wax mannequins notwithstanding). The place also houses a restaurant and an extensive souvenir shop.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[If you visit only one World War II-related site, make it this one. The main story of Japan&#146;s victory is punchily told, alongside displays on resistance hero Lim Bo Seng and Force 136, and on the local civilian experience during the Japanese occupation. The &#145;Surrender Chambers&#146;, containing exact waxwork replicas of the main players, are surprisingly effective at reconstructing the British surrender to the Japanese, and vice versa. But the main attraction is the sprawling structure of the fort itself. Wandering around the gun emplacements and underground complexes at your own pace gives a material sense of a place lived in and fought for that is just as striking (if not more so) than any number of theatricals. ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This $59m, five-storey
Buddhist complex is a house of worship
and a few museums rolled into one. Located
on the third storey is the Buddhist Cultural
Museum, that displays a selection of rare
artefacts detailing the history of Buddhism
and the different traditions practised in
Asian countries. On the same floor, located
at the rear of the hall, you’ll find the Sacred Buddha Relics Chamber. This houses what
are regarded as the Brains, Blood, Muscle
and Flesh Relics of Buddha. According
to the religion’s beliefs, these items are
supposedly Buddha’s body in eternal form.
They generally come in three sizes – akin to
a mustard seed, rice grain or kidney bean
– and are usually in the colours of white
(denoting bone), gold (flesh) and orangey-red
(brain). A must-see is the 15-foot Maitreya
Buddha that sits on the ground floor of the
main hall. Prayers are conducted at 8am
depending on a specific deity’s birthday.]]></description>

The hotel offers three categories of rooms &#150; deluxe, courtyard/verandah suites and villas &#150; and has devoted a floor to wheelchair-bound guests. In addition to housing Singapore&#146;s only Kushiage restaurant (traditional Japanese cuisine where fresh ingredients are coated in egg, breadcrumbs, deep fried and served on skewers), Si Bon, there are also three swimming pools scattered about.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This impressive Gothic edifice was built by Indian convict labourers and consecrated in 1862. The original church (another of George Drumgoole Coleman&#146;s creations) was replaced by a neo-classical building that was pulled down in 1855. In 1870, St Andrew&#146;s became a cathedral, and has played a central role in Anglican mission work in the region ever since. Despite the flashy new glass Welcome Centre, it&#146;s not really a showpiece. The transepts are more redolent of small-town English church halls than a grandiose cathedral, while the nave, with its ceiling fans and scattered supplicants, gives the sense that this is a working church. Brass wall plaques tell tales of personal suffering and professional sacrifice (it is striking how many of those commemorated died young), and guided tours highlight distinctive features, such as the Coventry Cross behind the pulpit (made from nails from the bombed ruins of Coventry Cathedral in 1940).]]></description>

Showered with architectural awards before it had even opened, the new building (a replacement for the old National Library on Stamford Road) is designed as two towers, linked by walkways and walled almost entirely with glass. The spacious reference section on the upper floors offers great views across the city.

				<description><![CDATA[Around the time of public holidays, the presidential grounds of the Istana is open to the public from 8:30am to 6pm. Bring your own food and have a picnic and, if you fancy it, participate in the cultural and arts events (like dances, brass bands and martial arts demonstrations) that usually take place. The main Istana building itself was completed in 1869 and the gardens &#150; which make for a lovely walk &#150; contain an old Japanese artillery gun, lily ponds, the burial grounds of the Bencoolen Muslims and even a nine-hole golf course. Another popular public attraction is the changing of the guard, which happens the first Sunday of the month and starts at 6pm.

				<description><![CDATA[Abrazos &#150; the Spanish word for &#145;hugs&#146; &#150; is a dance facility for aspiring tangueros to hotfoot their way to stardom.

With course names like &#145;Beginner&#146;s Boot Camp&#146; and &#145;Improvers&#146; Seminars&#146;, this looks like muy serious stuff for the most dedicated of dancers.

				<description><![CDATA[The press release gushingly refers to Zambuca &#145;as one of Singapore&#146;s most celebrated modern Italian restaurants&#146;. We&#146;re not so sure about that, but you gotta love them for the hyperbole. Part of the Michelangelo group (Holland V&#146;s Michelangelo and Original Sin), the 80-seater Zambuca recently revamped its menu. Of the 40-plus items, about 18 are new. But we&#146;re disappointed to see that executive chef Dennis Sim&#146;s offerings continue the restaurant&#146;s penchant for dishes that look decidedly more French and fusion than Italian, such as foie gras on brioche with braised apple and a port and fig reduction, and coconut panna cotta. Even the house special of porcini risotto is deglazed with Chardonnay, while the di Cappesante is a trio of scallops cooked three ways. One of which is tempura.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[It&#146;s in the perfect spot for a pre-show drink if you aren&#146;t fussy about service. When the place is packed things are understandably slow, but the waitstaff makes little effort to mollify you when you&#146;re frantic and running late. When it comes to outdoor seating, don&#146;t bother dragging a spare table three inches within the smoking area because you&#146;ll be admonished for breaching the invisible thread separating you from your non-smoking brethren. On the upside, Harry&#146;s has a wallet-friendly Grolsch beer bucket special ($28 for five) that soothes all aches and pains. Goes well with a tasty basket of wedges. <br />]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[
&#160;
By using something as apparently insignificant as the humble stamp as a springboard into Singapore&#146;s past, the Philatelic Museum is more successful at recounting the history of the country than other more wide-ranging museums. The displays &#150; some permanent, others changing &#150; are well presented, and interactive enough to keep younger visitors engaged. It&#146;s also a working post office: where better to fire off a few postcards of your own?

				<description><![CDATA[Not many places in Singapore offer you a chance to lie back on a deckchair (albeit a slightly flimsy plastic one) right by the river while you take swigs from a mug of cold beer. But at this very casual hangout you can do just that. Run by the Robertson Quay Hotel, this oddly named beach bar is exactly how an unpretentious, unfussy beach bar should be &#150; the only problem is that it doesn&#146;t quite have anything remotely resembling a beach next to it. But hey, who are we to complain? It&#146;s a relaxing spot away from the hustle and bustle of <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Bars/clarke-quay">Clarke Quay</a>, which is just a stone&#146;s throw away, and a decent place to watch the sun set behind the condos around the neighbourhood. If beer is not your thing, try their surprisingly well-mixed Singapore Sling. But don&#146;t blame us if you get mistaken for a tourist.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Some things never change &#150; not much, at least. Formerly known as Club Momo, the spacious establishment has now reopened as Velvet Dragon. And as the name suggests (intentionally or not), there certainly is an ah-beng, ah-lian feel that permeates, much like before the refurbishment. From the long, winding line of under-25s outside awaiting entry to the Top 40 tunes that play inside, this place is clearly for the younger party-goer, which is not a bad thing if you appreciate fun dance music. The d&#233;cor is more lush than before, with gigantic mirrors, mini wall lamps and velvet-wrapped maroon-coloured sofas (in honour of the club&#146;s name, perhaps) at the booth-seating areas &#150; the latter providing great respite when you get tired of dancing or feel like canoodling. If you find your energy waning, top up your buzz with their house cocktail, Blue Velvet, which is a tasty mix of Blue Cura&#231;ao, gin and tonic. Then go shake it up in one of the two cages they have on the dance floor.<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Owned by the same people who run Harry&#146;s, this place is quite a departure from its half-siblings. Modern in d&#233;cor and with dim but classy lighting, the inside is lined with booths that encourage groups of friends to congregate and mingle. Although there isn&#146;t a formal dance floor sectioned off, as the night progresses and more drinks are consumed, any standing room becomes an arena for you to get up and move along to the Indian beats, provided by a DJ and percussionist.<br />

Like the pure notes of double-boiled chicken soup laced with ruby-jewelled wolfberries; a clay pot of softly braised bean curd and spicy purple eggplant wedges; and fried noodles, seared with wok hei and stirred through with prawns and fish slices. Also try the dim sum menu, which contains the usual suspects of char-siew baos and siewmais &#150; little parcels of minced pork and prawns with a tender pastry shell &#150; with just the right amount of give under the teeth.]]></description>

Try the escabeche of red mullet; the fish is flash-fried and marinated in lemon, making for a deliciously tart, tender white fillet on salad greens. Also recommended is the chicken tagine with whole preserved lemons and olives, richly infusing the slow-cooked stew with a piquant after taste.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Executive chef Philippe Nouzillat presides over a warmly lit dining room and a thoroughly French menu that covers all the traditional bases. We&#146;re talking beef bourguignon, steak tartare, coq au vin, lemon sole &#224; la meuni&#232;re and garlicky oiled escargots here. They have drawn up an impressive 29- page wine list too. But nothing is overdone, least of all the wonderfully fragrant blue cheese salad showered with apple cubes and walnuts; a fan of perfectly done roast duck slices on a raspberry reduction and pur&#233;ed polenta; and the hunk of snowy white grilled pork chop. You won&#146;t go hungry like the Wolf here; Nouzillat&#146;s brasserie ticks the boxes in all departments. C&#146;est bon.

				<description><![CDATA[Our recent Friday night visit to a packed dining room told the story, and the robust Italian chefs dashing about behind the glassed-off kitchen were a reassuring sight. Now that La Braceria has closed (while looking for new premises), Borgo is our new favourite spot for home-made pastas (including the rarely seen, ear-shaped <em>orecchiette</em>) and sausages. The menu is cheap, classic and no-frills, and served in hearty portions, like parpadelle with a rich wild boar sauce streaked with basil, a zesty eggplant parmigiana and wonderful thin-crust pizza topped with meaty discs of sausages. Round it all off with a perfectly done chocolate almond cake.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Tucked away at the back of Holland Village is Indochine&#146;s Siem Reap, otherwise known as Siem Reap I (not to be confused with Siem Reap II, which is on the waterfront). This cosy drinking nook has a dark interior perfect for unwinding away from the more bustling section of Lorong Mambong. Of course, that&#146;s only when it&#146;s not soccer season, when the bar turns into a roaring madhouse. It houses Singapore&#146;s first &#145;water bar&#146; &#150; offering customers a range of natural, sparkling and flavoured agua &#150; which strikes us as a little pretentious, considering it&#146;s&#133;well, water. One more strike against the planet.]]></description>

The orders of meats (try the prime rib) arrive at the table in neat trays. Diners then cook meat on the wells of hotplates at the table. It can get rather smoky, so don&#146;t wear your best Chanel to lunch. If all that sounds like too much hard work, opt for the &#224; la carte menu, including tender chunks of pork cooked in a spicy, vinegarish kim-chi stew.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Seekers of all that is good and Mexican should tread lightly at Cha Cha Cha &#150; while the margaritas are deliciously potent and mixed with fine Sauza tequila, the food isn&#146;t quite as authentic as you&#146;d hope. The portions are by no means stingy, but there&#146;s something about the combination and proportions of cheese and spices (like cumin and ancho chili powder) that doesn&#146;t do the trick. Not to mention that Mexican food is traditionally cooked in good old-fashioned lard &#150; a no-no in the increasingly health-conscious F&#38;B industry &#150; which might be one reason the Cha Cha Cha fare isn&#146;t as good as it could be.]]></description>

With a roster of six signature ales including the dark, creamy Java and refreshing Straits Pale, award-winning brewmaster Fal Allen has raised the bar for local beer standards. Patrons are encouraged to appreciate the subtleties of each brew rather than the standard chug-a-jug approach.

				<description><![CDATA[The combination of a cosy, laid back, Cheerslike
vibe, a polished-wood bar decorated
with Americana sports memorabilia and
an operating toy train track keeps this oldie
golden. Reasonably priced drinks (which
are not watered down – always a plus) and
friendly service make for a great spot for
groups or just some quality solo time.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Settle back for some of the best Thai food in Singapore at crazy, cheap prices. The food here is of restaurant standard, but at cafe costs. The menu is small, yet crammed with delicious green curries; tart tom yam made not from bottled paste, but with fresh herbs and seafood stock; crisp pork chops; mango salad and a really good belachan fried rice.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[It&#146;s hard not to feel like one of the &#145;good ol&#146; boys&#146; when you walk into Morton&#146;s, a raucous haunt tucked away on the fourth floor of the Mandarin Oriental. This is where men come to loosen their ties, get drunk on wine and stuff themselves with oversized portions of meat and potatoes. If it sounds distinctly American, that&#146;s because it is &#150; this is one of five international branches of an awardwinning chain that originated in Chicago 30 years ago. Morton&#146;s boasts the &#145;best steak anywhere&#146;, which seems a hard tagline to live up to. The Chicago-style bone-in ribeye steak, cooked medium rare, made me think this may be true. The cut had the most flavour and was so tender it practically liquefied in your mouth. Also notable was the legendary hot chocolate cake, topped with fresh raspberries and powdered sugar, and oozing melted chocolate fudge.

				<description><![CDATA[Marutama&#146;s specialty is the thin Japanese noodle &#150; ramen &#150; in one of four soup bases (chicken, spicy chicken, prawn or nuts). The soups are mildly flavoured and almost caramelin tone, an ideal template for the wheaty flavour of the ramen. Be sure to order side dishes, like Kakuni (thick glistening wedges of pork belly stewed in a mellow soy sauce) and dashimaki tamago (a thick roll of omelette, seared briefly on the pan and collapsing on the tongue like a puff of golden air).]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[It&#146;s a little astonishing to realise that tiny Buko Nero still has such a long reservation list. But then, the biggest draw has always been husband-and-wife team Oscar and Tracy Pasinato, who run the tiny dining room like a trattoria: the Asian-inflected Italian menu changes regularly. Recent favourites included a rag&#249; of pork sausages, an exquisitely buttery squid-ink risotto and the cloud of coconut foam over a pannacotta streaked with gula melaka. Our only gripe is the poor ventilation from the open kitchen.]]></description>

Rule of thumb: take your cue from the queue. For great pan-fried radish cakes, make a beeline for Jin Ji Mei Shi (stall 96); China Street Fritters (stall 64) has crisply fragrant ngohhiang; while the congee at Zhen Zhen (stall 54) is wonderful.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The original Gluttons Bay was on Orchard Road, but it closed in the 1990s. In 2005, hawker food bible Makansutra hand-picked a dozen or so of Singapore&#146;s best stalls and set up this open-air, mini hawker centre bang next to the Esplanade theatre complex. It&#146;s touristy (the stalls are retro-style push carts) and pricier than other centres, but the food, from oyster omelettes to char kway teow, is great. And the waterfront location is a bonus on a balmy night.]]></description>

Before you begin your massage, your feet will be treated to a soak (instead of just a wipe down) and afterwards, you&#146;ll receive a thorough neck and shoulder massage ($69).]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Built against lush greenery on the slopes at the Civil Service Club, this retreat offers more than 50 ways to pamper yourself from head to toe, including TCM treatments prescribed by an in-house practitioner. Almost everything seems to come in XL sizes: dressing rooms, relaxation areas and even the lockers – they’re the largest we’ve ever seen in a spa. If you’re going for a massage, be sure to inform the therapist of your preferred pressure, as the standard strokes can be vigorous. The spa’s popular treatment, the Javanese Madilulur Retreat ($250 for 90 minutes), consists of a body scrub and massage, aimed to keep hydration levels in your skin sane. Book your treatment in advance to request the hilltop spa pavilion at no extra charge.]]></description>

Based on vinotherapy, the different remedies are designed around grape seeds, grape-seed oil, skin, stalks and wine extracts. Its signature Vintage Spa Retreat ($108) starts off with a wine-infused bath soak, then includes a body scrub and massage. Along with the uplifting citrus scent, this package facilitates lymphatic circulation, aids detoxification and stimulates skin’s natural collagen production. After your treatment, you’re encouraged to take advantage of the wireless network and surf away, while unwinding to yet another glass of red (hic!).

The high-pressure bunks give off just 0.01 per cent of UVB rays, less than the 12 per cent from the sun and 7 per cent from other beds. Anal types will no doubt still protest – any direct exposure to UVB is a bad idea. But if a tan is what you want, a tan is what you’ll get, and in just three sessions. The first trial session is free but comes with conditions. Call to find out more.]]></description>

Before you roll your eyes, the Pharmaplus products are not made out of any regular eco-fabric. Instead they have been made anti-bacterial, come with 200-thread stitching, and contain nano-sized particles of bamboo charcoal. The combination not only helps to keep joints warm, but also prevents static build-up and improves blood circulation. Also available are Eco Fab organic cotton towels made from the same fabric as the guards, which are supposedly more durable and absorbent because no chemicals or pesticides were used in their production.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Instead of memorising dance routines, try Chakradance, a form of self-expression where you surrender to the music, dance in any manner and focus on how each chakra (energy centre) makes you feel. According to teacher David Cheah &#150; the only certified instructor in Singapore and Malaysia &#150; Chakradance is said to balance one&#146;s natural energy flows and help redis-cover unique body rhythms that have been suppressed or unexplored.]]></description>

There&#146;s also a Wellness Centre that provides antioxidant-level scans, detox programmes, personalised nutritional planning and an anti-ageing treatments &#150; offered by Singapore&#146;s pioneering anti-ageing practitioner, Dr Y M Wong. Check if any of the 1,500 memberships are still available, but we suspect that with facilities like a sound-proof lounge, a health-food caf&#233; and a wine bar, that won&#146;t be the case for long.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[On reaching Ubin jetty, walk straight ahead for the National Parks information kiosk (open 8.30am-5pm daily), where you can pick up a map. To the left is the &#145;town&#146;, with a wayang (theatre) stage, a small shrine and some ramshackle houses that have been converted into bicycle rental shops, humdrum eateries and provisions shops (with stock that looks as if it hasn&#146;t been replenished for decades). Other villagers depend on farming and fishing for a livelihood. Many used to own chickens, but poultry was banned on the island after the 2005 bird flu epidemic. The best way to explore is by bike; the island is too large, and the weather usually too hot, for walking. Bikes (available 8am-6pm) cost $3-$8 to rent; it&#146;s wise to pick as new a model as possible. Less tiring (but less fun) is a taxi van &#150; unmetered; negotiate the fare beforehand. There are three cycling trails (on paved and dirt roads), which lead past old fruit and rubber plantations, mangrove swamps, water-filled quarry pits and old wooden houses. Toilets and shelters are located at key points. The Chek Jawa wetlands area on Ubin&#146;s eastern tip is worth visiting, with marine life visible at low tide. Visitor numbers are restricted to protect the fragile ecosystem, so you have to pre-book a guided tour &#150; contact the National Parks Board for more information. If you want to stay overnight, permits are not required for camping, but note that the water from public toilets and wells is not suitable for drinking or bathing. The Marina Country Club Ubin Resort (6388 8388, <a href="http://www.marinacountryclub.com.sg">www.marinacountryclub.com.sg</a>) offers basic air-conditioned chalets.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[You may need a map to navigate your way around this sprawling new-ish mall but one thing&#146;s for sure, they&#146;ve got everything under one roof - both shops, eateries and <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/film/venues/cinema/golden-village-gv-vivocity">Golden Village cinema</a> with Goldclass. Consumerism aside, check out the Singapore Biennale 2006 artworks on display at VivoCity <em>like</em> Korean artist Choi Jeong-Hua&#146;s creation, a six-meter tall Flower Tree, a spherical bouquet of brightly coloured flowers.
Opened in October 2006, VivoCity is practically the size of a town &#150; a futuristic one complete with amphitheatre, rooftop pool and cinema complex. It&#146;s unlikely you&#146;ll cover all one million square feet of retail, leisure and entertainment space in a day, so conserve your energy. The shops are picture-pretty and varied; it also contains Singapore&#146;s first Gap. &#160;
On the down side, they have <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/general/feature/the-insider-you-ask.-we-find-out-taxis-at-vivocity">the most annoying cab rank in Singapore</a> where there is always a long queue despite the easy availability of taxis.

				<description><![CDATA[When it comes to street fashion, this grubby five-level mall just off Orchard Road is the spot, offering everything from common Korean imports to rare cult items such as $2,000 sneakers. Basically, the more decrepit the shop, the cooler it is. Sub-culture types flock here to stock up on clothes, scoff cheap but delicious food and get tattooed and pierced &#150; Far East Plaza has the largest concentration of tattoo parlours in Singapore.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[So named because of its proximity to the bridge that links Singapore to Malaysia, Causeway Point is a typical suburban shopping mall. Expect the usual formula: cineplex, gaming arcade and a sprinkling of clothes and knick-knack shops that drive the heartlanders wild. Local department stores Metro and John Little, and supermarket chain Cold Storage, are anchor tenants.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Formerly Singapore&#146;s red-light district, Bugis has been cleaned up and redeveloped. Straits-Chinese shophouses were glassed in to form part of this mall (also called Parco Bugis Junction), which contains Japanese department store Seiyu and plenty of teen-friendly shops. Of particular interest is the Edge, a collection of Japanese-inspired streetwear boutiques; purists dismiss it as a poor imitation of &#8232;popular youth fashion destinations the Heeren Shops or Far East Plaza, but there are bargains.  Bugis Junction's outdoor fountain is where you will often see drenched, screaming kids having a whale of a time. As the water comes from the floor and in various shapes and patterns, guessing where the next sprout will spurt from is half the fun. ]]></description>

				<title>The Universal Wine Bar</title>
				<link>http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/xmlapi/xml_detail/?venue=536&amp;key=ffab6a24c60f562ecf705130a36c1d1e</link>

				<description><![CDATA[<strong><em></em></strong>
<strong>Where?</strong><br />
Up a cobbled path, behind the boutique Berjaya Duxton Hotel, in a conservation shophouse area, tucked away off&#160; Chinatown.<br />
<br />
<strong>History?</strong><br />
This space used to be an architect&#146;s office, but now it&#146;s a wine bar &#150; one that shares a name with a bar in&#160; the owner&#146;s native South Australia. Otherwise there are no similarities between the two. The people behind the scenes are the same people behind the Denise Wine Shops sprouting like mushrooms all over Singapore, which explains the prominence of&#160; Kaesler and Two Hands wines on the list, as they are the importers for them.
<strong>What&#146;s it like?</strong><br />
A place where you can finish the latest Patricia Cornwell while enjoying a glass of&#160; wine &#150; it&#146;s that brightly lit. The window side of&#160; this long, narrow space is taken up by hard, white formica-like&#160; banquettes &#150; hardly conducive to hunkering down for the night and ordering that second, third or fourth bottle. The bar is really the focal point of&#160; the space with its mosaic-like back wall with prominent liquor-bottle display. The wines are stored in a glass unit towards the back of&#160; the bar, but it&#146;s much easier to just choose from the list. Unless you stare at the diners across at <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/restaurants/western/broth">Broth</a>, there&#146;s not much people-watching to do. Or any other kind of&#160; distraction either. Other than filling our glasses, the staff&#160; pretty much left us alone, spending more time at the modern French restaurant upstairs.<br />
<br />
<strong>Who are the regulars?</strong><br />
While the Universal has yet to be discovered by the masses &#150; we were the only table on a Saturday night &#150; the set-up seems to target professionals who are interested in the quality of&#160; the drinks and the company.<br />
<br />
<strong>The drinks?</strong><br />
The 500 selections (including 20 by the glass) cover a large part of&#160; the wine-producing world &#150; Australia, New Zealand, France, Spain &#150; and range from a heart-racing $8,200 for the &#146;89 Petrus to $45 (a steal) for the &#146;06 Rolf&#160; Binder Semillon &#145;Hellions&#146;. The best deals here are the Aussie wines &#150; the list has 105 to choose from, with Rolf&#160; Binder and Kaesler wines leading the pack, and though the flavours are big and bold, the prices aren&#146;t. If&#160; cocktails are more your scene, the Universal probably isn&#146;t. However, you will find the general manager&#146;s own creation on the menu: the Bennetini ($25), a concoction of&#160; Absolut Blue, Citron, Mandarin, Bombay gin, Bacardi rum with lychee liqueur, lemon juice, lime cordial and lychee syrup. Sweet. <br />
<em><br />
Wine by the glass $13-$24; bottles $45-$8,200; cocktails $12-$25. </em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Don&#146;t be put off by the school-canteen vibe,or by the fact that the serving counter is so tiny. The nosh is excellent and incredibly good value. Unless you&#146;re Indian, the names of the dishes will probably mean nothing to you, but just about everything deserves a second helping &#150; including the sambal fish,a densely flavoured chicken curry, creamy dahl, and a wonderfully aromatic butter chicken. Wash it all down with masala teaor lime juice.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This Italian trattoria is already a hit with the neighbourhood set at Serangoon Garden. Chef-owner Salvatore Buono keeps things simple with well-executed dishes like carpaccio, portobello mushrooms in herbflecked cream, and linguine al cartoccio &#150; heavy loops of al dente pasta with fat mussels, baby langoustines and squid rings. Try the Buono, a slab of thin-crusted pizza that could feed two &#150; its base slathered with a light cream sauce and sprinkled with arugula and chunks of homemade sausages.

and serves up tipples like $10 champagne
and martinis.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[What is it about this Belgian bistro/bar that helps us unwind after a long day? The sunny yellow awning? The alfresco riverside seating? The chilled Belgian beers? Whatever the combination, it always feels like the equivalent of a long back rub at happy hour. Though Brussels Sprouts is known for its mussels, we&#146;re a bit ashamed to admit that we order the Belgian fries (make sure not to use the &#145;f&#146; word) with three kinds of dipping sauce every time. The Hunter sauce is delicious, especially when this salty side dish is paired with wheat beer. It&#146;s also a great option if you&#146;re running late to a play at the nearby Singapore Repertory Theatre, as the food and drinks go down quickly.

				<description><![CDATA[A pioneer of China&#146;s revolutionary struggle in the early 20th century, Dr Sun Yat Sen made numerous trips to South-east Asia; a sympathiser, Teo Eng Hock, turned over this villa to the cause. It was here in 1906 that Dr Sun formed the Singapore branch of the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance, and he would return several more times before his success in deposing the emperor in 1911 &#150; whereupon a new battle for the future of China began. The story told here fleshes out the political history of the Singapore Chinese, and makes a change from the more usual focus on migrant labour and World War II. While there are a few videos, replica objects and waxworks, the spacious halls and galleries are overwhelmingly reliant on captioned black and white archive photos. Next door is the Burmese Buddhist Temple, containing a 3m (11ft) marble Buddha, the largest Burmese Buddha image outside Burma. ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Formerly, this quaint Chinese museum was one of the oldest temples in Singapore, set up by Hakka and Cantonese immigrants in the early 1800s, before becoming a clan association clubhouse that served both dialect groups. Today, it is Singapore&#146;s first street museum, where visitors can view artefacts donated by residents of Chinatown including an old ice kachang maker and the iconic Singer sewing machine of the 1960s.
This building was originally a Buddhist shrine, built in 1824 and said to be the oldest Chinese temple on the island; it later became a centre for the Hakka and Cantonese communities. The religious functions were eventually moved elsewhere as the building became dilapidated, and in the 1990s the place was restored and converted into a &#145;street museum&#146;. Don&#146;t expect much &#150; there&#146;s some historical information, a few artefacts and a small glass-cased model portraying 19th-century street life. <br style="mso-special-character: line-break" />

				<description><![CDATA[The most iconic of Singapore&#146;s World War II sites, even though the museum is housed in a purpose-built venue, and the chapel is a reconstruction (the original was shipped to Australia after the war). The main interest lies in the stories of industry and ingenuity within the POW camp. The civilian and military internees essentially established an alternative, if somewhat surreal, society, catering for everything from entertainments to the manufacture of thousands of everyday items. Contact with the outside world was maintained through handmade and carefully disguised radios. The chapel, located in the courtyard of the museum, encourages quiet reflection. It also houses copies of the kitschy but affecting Changi murals, recreated by the original artist, Stanley Warren, after a widely publicised international effort to find him; the preponderance of blue and white is because of his reliance on billiard cue chalk. The $8 audio guide is pricey, but it is comprehensive and complements the displays well.]]></description>

Its aim is to be an avenue for emerging artists to hone their craft while also supporting and promoting established veterans of Indian art. The gallery doubles &#150; or perhaps quadruples &#150; as a space to host art-related launches, discussions, workshops and other art-appreciation programmes to generate and develop the perception of modern Indian art.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This former Catholic boys&#146; school, a striking white building with two wings and long verandas, was revamped in the early 1990s when there was a policy of converting old colonial buildings into public museums. Because of its small, unusual and hidden gallery spaces, it has never held blockbuster shows. Instead, it specialises in smaller exhibitions, mostly 20th-century Asian visual art, often drawn from its own collection of South-east Asian &#145;pioneer&#146; art. ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Actually
We’ve already registered Actually as
the place to go for quality street chic
fashion in Singapore. Since mid-April,
four more brands have found a cosy
corner in the boutique: Elvis Jesus’s
funky Ts flown in from the UK; street
label Headquarter by three Thai designers;
18th Amendment from Australia;
and RVCA, a collection of uniquely
designed casual wear from the USA.

Founded by a pair of  brothers in 1993, Freitag creates cult bags made from tarpaulin. Not only is each item unique, the line is also selectively distributed: the boutique Actually is one of  just three exclusive retailers of  Freitag in Asia. The bags have inspired many copies like Demano and Kultbag (see below), but that’s a good thing – it signals that more people are recycling. A word of  warning about the burned-rubber odour. ‘It’s unlikely that you’ll ever get rid of  the smell,’ says Paul Khor, owner of  Actually. Prices from $129 to $379.]]></description>

Inside the store on Ann Siang Road, you&#146;ll find everything except its Comme des Gar&#231;ons collaborative line. While the label&#146;s polo shirts have long been considered a wardrobe staple, the question is why they became so popular in the first place. The answer lies in its signature laurel logo &#150; based on the Wimbledon symbol &#150; which is stitched rather than ironed on; after all, beauty is in the small details. And, of course, its tennis gear is matchless.]]></description>

There&#146;s also a range of body massages that use semi-precious stones like smoky quartz and agate. But that&#146;s not their oddest offering: the Aventurine Green Claypot Prata therapy claims to lock in the heat using prata (yes, the crispy dough bread), while jamu herbs work on the body to reduce aches and pains.

Be warned, there will be other like-minded fashionistas doing the same, so it’s likely you’ll end up in a Catch-22 situation. We’ll leave you to your own devices but with labels like ReshamM, Tan Tan, Mea Culpa (see photo 2) and I Spy all set to part you from your money, we wish you well.

				<description><![CDATA[American fashion designer and artist Ann Wiser turns Jakarta&#146;s waste into bags and accessories. Although she&#146;s since moved to Manila, her idea lives on in Indonesia&#146;s XS Project. The foundation buys discarded detergent bags scavenged from the trash, and then hires members of various communities to wash and sew them into new products. The resulting wastepaper baskets and pencil cases are a graphic spectacle of repetitive patterns. All profits from the sale of these items are ploughed back into the foundation&#146;s work.]]></description>

With more than 1,600 happenings taking place in a year and almost 300 banners produced for each, the label is hardly short on supplies. Started in 1999, Demano has established agreements with all of  the city’s major cultural venues to use their residual materials. Made by three designers, each bag is cut to showcase the most interesting aspects of  the banners’ original designs, like cutting out the [fb01] sh in a ‘Lisboa em Festa’ banner to use on the front of  a bag.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The covetable Nike Air Force 1 is back
in town with a whole new collection to
celebrate its 25th anniversary. Over the
years, Air Force 1 has garnered a cult
following with avid sneaker collectors
willing to pay exorbitant sums for a pair
of shoes (and they’re not even Jimmy
Choos). This time around, the new editions
include a USD$2,000 (S$3,000) anaconda
skin Air Force 1 model, a remake
of the original Air Force 1 and a number
of limited edition kicks inspired by
basketball icons. The 25th anniversary
collection drops in stages; the last will be
25 March.

				<description><![CDATA[When Chris Lee first started The&#160;Asylum back in 1999, it was a design studio specialising in commercial graphics tints and branding packaging projects. By 2005, The Asylum had morphed into a retail shop where local designers went to display their wares. Today, The Asylum sells everything from limited edition Fred Perry sneakers, quirky Kubrick toys and Kwodrent&#146;s hand-sewn pieces to monthly issues of &#145;Nylon&#146; and &#145;Surface&#146; and music CDs from obscure, experimental indie folk bands. In short, they don&#146;t quite fit into any conventional retail genre. Up next, we hear there are plans for a music label called Asylum Sounds, a potential in-house magazine and maybe even a book. Is there nothing they won&#146;t do?]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[It’s safe to say that the male race has
an easier time deciding what to wear
on a day-to-day basis. Pull on a pair of
pants, button up a shirt, slip on some
shoes and walk out the door. Boring?
Perhaps, but simplicity can be beautiful.
Just look at what Swedish label Filippa
K has achieved with its menswear. The
classic fi ve-pocket jean has been given a
twist thanks to a little stretch added in.
Knitwear remains classic but jazzed up
with a graphic – not plain – patch at the
elbow. It is, after all, the details that count.]]></description>

At weekends, let yourself go to the music of international DJs like Sven V&#228;th, &#194;me and Infected Mushroom. And if you&#146;re into music by the likes of The Rapture, Justice and Boys Noize, paint the town glow-in-the-dark with Zouk&#146;s bi-monthly party, ReadySet Glo.

				<description><![CDATA[Going back to its roots, Velvet keeps it smooth with its new Balearic Thursdays. Back in the day, the decks of this intimate and exclusive club sampled the lovin&#146; touch of luminaries like Paul Oakenfold. Since its refurb last year, soul man Norman Jay and father of the Balearic beat DJ Alfredo have resurrected this style made popular in the late &#146;80s and early &#146;90s. And while you&#146;re grooving, take time to appreciate the works by pop-culture icons like Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Takashi Murakami.

				<description><![CDATA[Play retains much of the layout of the former Happy, although they&#146;ve trashed up the d&#233;cor a lot more &#150; in a good way. The graffiti on the walls gives the place a slightly underground feel, and the deep funk house and cheerful pop remixes are a guaranteed crowd-pleaser.

The name &#145;Phuture&#146; means everything experimental and quirky, and that it is. The most avant-garde of the three outlets in <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/Club/zouk">Zouk Club</a>, this space&#146;s unique music policy sees everything from break beats and hip hop to nu jazz. Original artwork by the likes of Massimo Iosa Ghini and Roy Lichtenstein decorates the wall of the long, undulating bar, not that many of its 18-25 year-old patrons would notice; they&#146;re too busy bumpin&#146; and grindin&#146;.

				<description><![CDATA[A century ago, Telok Ayer Street was right up against the sea. And this temple, known as the Temple of Heavenly Happiness, was popular with newly arrived immigrants, who came here to burn incense in thanks to Ma Cho Po (a Taoist deity and protector of seafarers) for their safe arrival. Some of the materials used in the temple were taken from the boats, including the rooftop mosaic. Inside, the main altar features a statue of Ma Cho Po, and other deities of luck, war and punishment]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[If you like live music performances (10pm until late), you can join the hordes of people packing this place. Practically bursting at the seams on weekends, you&#146;ll be hard-pressed to even find a decent spot to stand in. But if you can manage the discomfort of feeling like a sardine in a can, start filling yourself up with some of the brews (five bottles of Erdinger, Corona Extra or Tiger go for $50, all night long) and you&#146;ll be partaking in the rowdiness in no time. While the performers differ nightly, it&#146;s songbird Michaela who always rouses the folk with her throaty vocals and mature deliveries of both crowd favourites and current chart-toppers. On quieter nights, when you can actually find a stool to rest your bum, kick back and bob along to the jazzy house tunes, at the same time appreciating the lovely and understated Peranakan-style decor.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[As its name implies, this venue is quite rightly suited for those who stay up all night. It practically never sleeps and you&#146;ll love the fact that the happy hour lasts from 11am to 9pm. Serving food in the day, it turns into a live music bar at night and appears to be very popular with the expatriate crowd. And that&#146;s probably thanks to the regular house bands (there are currently two, Chill Factor and Batteries Not Included, otherwise known as BNI) that crank up the entertainment factor by churning out contemporary and rock music. Lest you get bored of hearing the same stuff, Insomnia changes the bands every three months or so, so don&#146;t get too attached. And if you belong to the &#145;fly the friendly skies&#146; pack, there&#146;s a bonus: you automatically get 30 per cent off food and drink.

				<description><![CDATA[At this Scottish restaurant one of the standouts is, ironically, an English invention: the Scotch egg ($10), which was dreamed up by the London food store, Fortnum &#38;Mason, in 1738. Still, this one should not be given a miss. The tasty hard-boiled egg is wrapped with semi-salty sausage meat and encased in a layer of perfectly fried bread crumbs. It&#146;s crisp and satisfying, particularly after a night of pubbing. And it&#146;s almost better than Mum&#146;s. If you&#146;re more thirsty than hungry, you can sample a taste that is truly all Scotland. A mere $9.50 opens the door to the 225 whiskies on offer, but you&#146;d need $2,800 for a bottle of top-of-the-range single malt.
For people-watching at Clarke Quay, Highlander and <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/music/venues/general/pump-room">The Pump Room</a> have cornered the market - the outside tables here are currently the best location.

&#160;Oft-described as &#145;the bar where ah lians and ah bengs gather&#146;, this assumption is only half-true. The performers at this live-music room actually play a good mix of English and Mandarin favourites until the end of happy hour. Then dancers, aerialists and guest performers throng the stage and transform the place into something resembling a getai, albeit classier.

				<description><![CDATA[Holland Village has had quite a makeover over the past few years, but its old-faithful watering hole Wala Wala &#150; affectionately known as Wala&#146;s to locals &#150; remains ensconced on Lorong Mambong. On the ground floor, enjoy a cold one at the distinctive yellow-lit bar and catch the game on one of several flat-screen TVs. The bar upstairs hosts a variety of local music and comedy acts, with an &#145;acoustic happy hour&#146; from 7 to 8.30pm. The only annoying change at Wala&#146;s is the new smoking policy &#150; only a limited number of seats are available for smokers outdoors, so the remaining cigarette-puffing patrons have to hang around the adjoining alley like delinquent teenagers.]]></description>

Or just come, after the movies, for the pavlova or sticky date pudding.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Seemingly less of a funky, cool, chill-out hotspot and more a rowdy, bloke-ish sports bar these days, Studio 54-esque Kandi Bar still pulls in the crowds, though not necessarily the gorgeous model types any more. The TV screens showing football detract from the bright candy-coloured lights and the still-fun-and-soulful house music &#150; it&#146;s a bit disappointing but, then again, this is Singapore. On a brighter note, there&#146;s the exquisitely crafted, Karim Rashid-designed, petal-shaped Veuve Clicquot Loveseat, so that those so-in-love/lust can sip champers while staring into each others&#146; eyes.

&#160;
It&#146;s a universally acknowledged fact that a sure-fire way to get your date in a romantic mood is to take him/her to a lovely seaside locale, loosen things up with good booze and a whole lot of atmosphere, and voila &#150; you&#146;re set for the night. Essentially, that sums up this classy joint. With views over the lolling greens of Sentosa Golf Club and the stunning seascape south of the island, the restaurant-bar exudes a contemporary vibe with its interesting glassware and brightly coloured seats. Kudos to the attentive wait-staff, who know exactly when to blend into the background, and when to zip over and speed up your bill before your date loses the mood.&#160;<br />

				<description><![CDATA[An all-girls bar (although men are welcome) located on the top floor of a shophouse. Be prepared to climb as there isn&#146;t an elevator service, but if you want a cosy spot to enjoy music and good company, it&#146;s a worthy ascent. Play pool in the private room, drink up at the bar or sway on the rooftop terrace (there are fans to keep you cool while you turn on the heat). If you want to hold your own private soir&#233;e, call ahead and book the private room at no extra charge. The music here is mainly Top 40 and R&#38;B, but if you have a favourite playlist on your iPod, bring it along and the service staff will be more than happy to hook you up. Drinks are some of the cheapest in town: housepours at $6 and a magnum of Hoegaarden at $15.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Orchard Road is not normally known for its quality bars, barring those situated on the Emerald Hill stretch, a cluster of five watering holes and one club. Alley Bar is by far the classiest of the lot. Located in a restored shophouse, it has made a name for itself with an unpretentious vibe, tasty menu of bar grub &#150; try the dim sum dumplings &#150; and potent cocktails.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[It is likely that by the time you end up at Rav, it is past 2am and you are already half-pissed, if not more. And that&#146;s just a conservative guess. Most of the folks who come here are the same ones refusing to go home even after all the other clubs have shut their doors. Luckily, there&#146;s Rav and its playlist of unadulterated fun dance and house grooves, which is the best kind of music when you are all liquored up. Attracting a mix of trendy types, yuppies and gay men, this is the place where everyone lets their hair down and their inner dance-demon out. There are often drink promotions by the pitchers &#150; not to mention a happy-hour deal that gives you your second housepour for just ten cents (Mon-Fri, 6pm-midnight) so there&#146;s no need to worry about losing your buzz. If you really want to have fun, go late; get there too early and you&#146;ll be standing around waiting for the night owls to arrive.
<br />
<em>$20, includes one drink.</em>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[For a taste of the magic isle right here in Singapore, cross a wooden bridge into a luxuriant garden. Welcome to Villa Bali, the creation of owner-designers Robin Greatbatch and Andrew Seow, who set out to re-create their experiences in Indonesia with this bar, part of the larger Little Bali &#145;lifestyle resort&#146;. Filled with daybeds and divans, and surrounded by wild plants and ponds, it&#146;s an idyllic drinking spot in the heart of Gillman Village. Service is efficient, but unobtrusive, allowing you to kick back and chill out undisturbed. The usual bar stock dominates, but there are also Balinese wines that go well with the Indian tapas.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Regarded by its many regulars as the only true Irish pub in town, the playfully monikered Sod’s has been paying homage to the Emerald Isle’s most famous liquid export for over five years. Guinness memorabilia abounds and, for novelty value, there’s a real Irishman behind the bar (love him or loathe him: go, you’ll find out why). If  you’re looking for a plastic Paddy theme bar, you’ll walk away disappointed. However, if  you’re looking for the genuine craic, this Dublin-style city pub provides in abundance. Pints go for $12 during happy hour (until 8pm) and around $14 thereafter.]]></description>

&#160;
One of Singapore&#146;s few microbreweries, Brewerkz offers beers concocted on site by a Canadian brewmaster. Sit outside along the river or in the airy atrium, done up like a factory with exposed copper pipes. Choose from 12 handcrafted ales, lagers and stouts. The American-slanted food (pizza burgers, steaks, jambalaya) isn&#146;t bad either.

				<description><![CDATA[Before he moved to Priv&#233;, New York-import Wayne Nish was brought in to revitalise the Screening Room and his bold, overhauled menu is wonderfully done. The mixed platters of sashimi and sushi are a delightful rainbow with salmon cured with coriander or kanpachi hit with citrus. Mains tend to lean towards seafood (we loved the slabs of tuna nestling on mesclun, roast peppers and beans) but the fat chunks of lamb rack coated with coriander seeds and tamarind are textbook-perfect. Unusually, Nish has curated a section of raw milk cheeses, which is reason enough for a return visit.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Stacks of wine bottles from more than 100 labels line the dark wood-panelled walls of this shophouse-turned-&#145;Spanish provisions store&#146;. Ambience is a major player here, with dusty wooden barrels crowding the corners, a casual lounge room with armchairs upstairs, and a front deck that&#146;s ideal for enjoying something from the cigar menu. The wine-by-the-glass selection is decent (about a dozen on offer), while oenophiles may be more interested in the &#145;library collection&#146; &#150; an exclusive selection of bottles acquired from private collections (although charged at exclusive prices). The tapas menu is superb &#150; marinated olives, cheeses and mushrooms are must-tries, along with the paper-thin-crust pizzas. <br />

				<description><![CDATA[Situated in the Oriental Hotel, Morton&#146;s is elegant but un-pretentious. Topped by a pagoda roof and opening onto the hotel&#146;s atrium, the setting is striking. Its martinis are the biggest and best in town (though on the pricey side) and free steak sandwiches are served during happy hour (5-7pm). The friendly crowd (regulars, hotel guests and business types) and staff keep the place down-to-earth.

				<description><![CDATA[This smoking yet non-smoky bar serves up some of the best happy hour deals in Chinatown. (The name means Chinatown in Spanish, by the way.) And after nagging from punters, it&#146;s now open during the day. Whereas you used to have to rely on other restaurants for sustenance, Barrio has now opened up its own kitchen. Try the bruschetta ($10 for a dozen), which will more than keep the hunger pangs at bay until dinner. A happy-hour glass of wine is $6, rising to $12 during regular hours.

The wait-staff are attentive, easy on the eyes and the bar is not rowdy in the least.

				<description><![CDATA[There&#146;s a reason why this place is packed every night of the week with English bankers: it&#146;s right in the heart of the Boat Quay end of the CBD, and is more British than tea and scones with the Queen. Owners Gaelic Inns, whose stable also includes Muddy Murphy&#146;s, have decided to dispense with such fripperies as ambience and comfortable, ample seating; with a plum location right next to the river, they couldn&#146;t fail even if they pulped durians to make fruit juice. If you&#146;re visiting from the UK, a trip to this mock-Victorian tavern is about as adventurous as pulling a beer can from the fridge, and approximately ten times more expensive. In every possible sense this is a facsimile of a night out in London (in fact the humidity and local bar-staff are the only reminder that you&#146;re still in Asia); and just like the Big Smoke itself, a Friday-night stint here will wage war on your wallet. Inflated prices, stentorian patrons and cramped environs can take the shine off the Penny Black experience, and you can&#146;t escape the feeling that you&#146;re part of a blatantly profiteering enterprise, but for convenience and location alone (not to mention a happy hour lasting eight and a half hours) it still gets our, ahem, stamp of approval.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The imaginative minds at Imaginings (owners of KPO, Wala Wala and Balaclava) are good at creating bars with personality &#150; and they haven&#146;t disappointed fans with Bar-Stop, a blink-and-you&#146;ll-miss-it, three-in-one restaurant, bar and live jazz venue tucked away on Devonshire Road. This deceptively spacious two-storey spot is home to an outdoor restaurant and indoor bar, as well as an upstairs lounge filled with funky furniture. For those looking to dine, the quiet garden-like seating outside should be your choice for the night. Those with an eye for a well-stocked bar and an ear for live jazz can sit up close to the stage and take in all the (very loud) action. The polished cement floor, exposed brick walls, floor-to-ceiling windows and exceptional service make this space one of the coolest spots in town. It is indeed a bar to stop at.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[If you haven&#146;t come down for a spell, Jazz is now downstairs from its original home and is twice its former size. Don&#146;t worry; it&#146;s still cosy and intimate, and remains one of the most authentic dives in the city. Owner Eddie Chan wants to educate his audience, to &#145;open their eyes to jazz&#146;. The croons of resident vocalist Alemay Fernandez can be enjoyed over a tapas-centric dinner, or over martinis on the &#145;tango seats&#146; upfront. Visiting musicians are frequent &#150; look out for international names like Dale Barlow, Marcus Printup and Aaron Goldberg &#150; even Pat Metheny played a spontaneous set here. If Eddie is propping up the bar (which reveals a hundred or so malt whiskies) the night you visit, beg him to tell his story. A former architect, Eddie only discovered jazz in his fifties; his love of the genre soon became his life&#146;s preoccupation &#150; a journey that led him to open the club in 2002, picking up the vibraphone along the way, on which he performs with the band on Tuesdays and Sundays.

				<description><![CDATA[Irish bars come two-a-penny anywhere in the world, but of all Singapore&#146;s &#145;craic dens&#146;, Muddy&#146;s comes laden with arguably the most authentic vibe. Though it&#146;s tucked away from view under (not even in) a nondescript shopping arcade across the road from Orchard Towers, the landlords have wisely made a virtue of its subterranean location by installing alfresco bench seats below pavement level, while indoors there&#146;s cheer aplenty any night of the week. Live bands &#150; often very good ones, too &#150; perform from a slightly raised stage, the black stuff flows freely and it&#146;s mercifully free of those &#145;comedy&#146; signposts which indicate Dun Loaghaire is 15,000 miles away. Food is a major plus; even at 10.30pm on a Saturday night I was served a huge, inexpensive &#145;Muddy&#146;s BLT&#146; with potato wedges, minutes after requesting it. The intrusively loud sports coverage booming out from the giant TV screen can be a turn-off, particularly for non-rugby fans. But whether you&#146;re in for a quick Guinness or staying till 2am, Muddy&#146;s caters to every class of drinker. Its cosmopolitan, West-meets-East clientele is a tribute to the pub&#146;s savvy self-promotion and genuinely friendly ambience.

				<description><![CDATA[This place has the honour of being designed and built in Ireland, then shipped to Singapore and re-assembled at Circular Road. So no wonder you feel immediately transported from the humdrum of Singapore life the moment you step through its doors. You&#146;ll appreciate how everything is so straightforward and simple, from its draughts to its Irish stews &#150; no gimmicks to distract you from having a truly Irish experience &#150; and resident musican Gerry Cox, who performs live acoustic renditions of Irish folk songs and contemporary hits Monday to Friday, from 8.30pm onwards.<br />

				<description><![CDATA[If you like beer, raucous live music and huge servings of greasy American food such as burgers and lamb chops, then it&#146;s a wonder you haven&#146;t found this joint on your own. Bumpin&#146; on a weekend night, the place is packed to its wooden rafters with folks looking for a grand ol&#146; time. The laidback atmosphere is a plus for anyone who doesn&#146;t fancy getting all dressed up, and even if you haven&#146;t got one funny bone in you, you&#146;ll giggle at the lewd jokes flashed across the TV screens. &#145;What do a priest and a Christmas tree have in common? Their balls are just for decoration.&#146; Right. If wisecracks and music aren&#146;t enough to keep you entertained, there&#146;s also a pool table you can saunter round.

If all else fails hit the J&#228;ger bombs for $15 a pop.

&#160;
An institution of sorts, Balaclava sees executive types hanging out after work with prettily tressed girls clinging to their arms (and wallets). Born in 2001, it is the epitome of bar chic with a handsome, masculine feel, dark interiors, plush leather sofas and snazzy flat-screen TVs. Several bands play their pop tunes here on different nights, though the more popular are Shirlyn &#38; The UnXpected, who perform on Wednesdays and Thursdays, and EIC, which performs on Fridays. A big thumbs-up for the spacious smoking area outside, which allows you to puff away without feeling like some criminal exiled to a box.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This karaoke pub has been around since the early 1990s and has always proudly bared the rainbow flag. Contrary to its name, you won&#146;t find cows or coolies here. Instead, you&#146;ll get a queer mix of women in their early twenties and thirties, with men in office-wear singing Mando-pop tunes. The men and women may not sing in the same choir, but everyone gets along famously. The guys know full well they won&#146;t have girls harassing them to buy drinks, so the unspoken arrangement works for everyone &#150; the ladies can enjoy their cocktails and conversation, and the lads can sing to their hearts&#146; content. Bar owner Joey knows most of her regulars by name and is often seen mingling with the happy campers. It&#146;s all fun and merry-making here with good conversation and often not-so-good singing.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Living up to its name, this gem of a bar can be a tough one to find. Once you&#146;ve nailed down the location &#150; Circular Road is the parallel street behind <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/restaurants/International/boat-quay">Boat Quay</a> &#150; and made it up the three flights of stairs without running out of breath, you&#146;ll be delighted by what you find. Inside, the mismatched furniture, low lighting,and oddly soothing pink and burgundy walls strip the bar of any airs. Hideout&#146;s patrons are not there to be seen or make PC small talk &#150; all they want is to sit back, relax and shoot the breeze with their friends.
Indie bands play on Wednesdays, DJs spin house beats on Fridays,and on all other nights the DJ rotates between hip hop, funk and jazz.]]></description>

A playful contrast toits neighbour, the Raffles Hotel, it attracts an easy-going, eclectic crowd (it&#146;s particularly popular with media types). Punters relax on leather loungers and the deck is lit by a huge electric billboard. Pray for rain &#150; when the heavens open, drinks are two for the price of one.]]></description>

&#160;
While taxi uncles are still rather clueless when you mention its multi-syllabic name, One Rochester does not stop drawing stressed-out individuals eager to attain a sense of peace in the bar&#146;s very green, very snug surroundings. Although it is situated close to the busy North Buona Vista Road, the gastro bar remains surprisingly impervious to the sounds of traffic. With mosquito-repelling citronella and animpressive 200-something wine list, One Rochester&#146;s &#145;best kept secret&#146; status is only moments away from being revealed.

&#160;
While the super-sized stone warriors lining the entrance of Forbidden City appear imposing, don&#146;t be fooled. Inside, the downstairs Bar Cocoon beckons with numerous daybeds made even more enticing with colourful pieces of cloth carelessly draped about. On Wednesdays, the bar hosts Babes and Bubbles Ladies Night with onefor-one deals on Veuve Clicquot champagne (by the glass), selected cocktails, house wines and house beers. The kitschy Ice Palace room fits ten and is worth at least one visit to have the experience of knocking back 42 Below Vodka shots ($15 each) in minus-5 degree Celsius surroundings. It&#146;s gimmicky but a fun way to get sloshed.]]></description>

Regulars come here forthe strong Long Island Iced Teas (just like at its sister bar, <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/gay/venues/bar/tantric-bar">Tantric</a>), double-shot drinks and also for the kitsch paraphernalia of semi-nude male pictures and musical-theatre posters that decorate the walls. The staff&#160;are friendly, personable and flirtatious, as is the crowd &#150; a mix of older Caucasian men and younger locals, tourists and expats.&#160;<br />

Maybe it&#146;s the lacklustre drinks or uninformed service, all of which contribute to a less-than-perfect experience. To its credit though, the bar boasts a nice setup with its strategically positioned pool that allows you to appreciate gorgeous dual views of both the sunset and beachwearclad pilgrims who&#146;ve come seeking a taste of Ibiza. Its spot-on repertoire of languid tunes on slow afternoons and more upbeat tracks at its Saturday foam parties also keeps things exciting.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[
&#160;
The cavernous space is crowded with tall tables leaving little room for dancing, which is disappointing because the solid top 40 cover band &#150; led by a Chaka Khan-loving singer and spiced up by dancing girls who change their outfits every few songs &#150; definitely warrants booty-shaking. The bar service needs serious help here (as it does in most of the venues at St James). It can take quite a while to get your drink, but the second you put it down on one of the tables, at least five servers scurry up from out of nowhere to put down a coaster. Are they worried the place (which is TigerLive during the day) is going to get dirty?]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Imagine having a restaurant so busy that you refuse to answer the telephone at all. Well, here it is. PS Cafe only takes bookings by SMS and does not take bookings at all for brunch on Sunday. But it is worth the wait &#150; just check out the huge pieces of home-made rocky-road on the counter as you walk in. The menu is quite restricted but delicious, and the service is brisk. Sit indoors near the open kitchen or outside overlooking the leafy environs. On Sundays, expect a 30-minute wait &#150;&#160;don&#146;t fret as we have seen some others doing, just put your name down and stroll around Dempsey Road for a while. Actually, that should help to ensure that you can manage all three courses.

				<description><![CDATA[It&#146;s beloved of bikers and pool players, but the jury&#146;s still out on BLooiE&#146;s. On our first visit to their Bukit Timah outpost we faced a cold reception in every sense. Deafening rock, air-con so preposterously high it felt like winter in Montreal, brusque service (&#145;Here. Sign it. With the pen,&#146; ordered a waitress) and dire food (an undercooked steak, with carrots so hard they almost broke my fork). On returning, warmth was all around: soft pop music, the wait-staff all smiles and charm, and a perfectly decent Cajun chicken burger. Pick your night to avoid the Roadhouse blues, and you&#146;ll find an enticing menu of high-cholesterol treats in a cosy, roadside-diner ambience: spacious surrounds, moose head and rugby shirts on the wall, well-stocked brickwork bar, TV screens and leafy, out-of-town location. A beery, blokeish bonhomie prevails, so don&#146;t take a date unless you&#146;re a serious ah beng. Botak Jones does this stuff much cheaper, too, but BLooiE&#146;s shades it for style and comfort.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Imagine a restaurant business model where, at the end of lunch, diners pay what they think the meal was worth. A risky proposition, to be sure, but one that has been put into practice at Annalakshmi and seems to have done them no harm. The buffet counter is entirely vegetarian &#150; dhals, soups, cauliflower curry, yoghurt dips, papadums &#150; with everything cooked daily. It&#146;s low-fuss, home-spun cooking that wins our vote for its earnestness and complete lack of pretension. At the end, payment amounts to a donation to the restaurant (and its support for sister organisation, the Temple of Fine Arts), but really, anything less than $5 per head would be a disgrace.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[A mid-sized hawker&#146;s centre on the corner of Telok Ayer and Boon Tat roads, 121 is a favourite lunchtime haunt for Chinatown workers from all walks of life, from the well-groomed expatriate to the motorbike courier. The biggest queue emanates from Nur Nasi Padang, known as the finest purveyor of Indonesian food in the vicinity. Expect a generous portion of melt-in-the-mouth beef rendang, addictively garnished chicken drumsticks and a colourful range of meat curries and spicy vegetable dishes. Other food-stall highlights include the omnivorous Kingsland Vegetarian stand &#150; which proudly proclaims, &#145;No pork or lard&#146;, and serves a mean duck laksa &#150; and Paratha Treat, for the last word in chepati, daal and samosas. For pudding, make a beeline for Frankie&#146;s Peanut Pancake, a winner of the Green Book of Food Awards 07/08.]]></description>

But if that sounds too messy for you, there&#146;s also an excellent value $10.99++ ($9.99++ for students, $8.99++ if you are 55 years and above) set lunch comprising soup of the day, main course, and dessert or hot drink.]]></description>

us feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
The friendly and bubbly service is top-notch,
stemming from Saigon-born owner and chef
Trent Thai. Then there’s the food – so good that
Vietnam sends cooking students to be trained
here. The pho bo – beef noodles with a full
bodied soup stock ($9) – is the main reason to
visit, though the grilled pork chop ($9) isn’t half
bad either. One enduring regret is that we’ve
never made it to dessert, we’re always so full
after the main course and coffee.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[It&#146;s safe to say that when Sticky Rice opened, it raised the glamour quotient of the residential suburb of Serangoon Gardens. The Thai restaurant has been designed to within an inch of its life, complete with smoky mirrors and dramatic splashes of blood-red lacquered panels. The set lunches (under $10) are a bargain. On weekends, the place buzzes as the owners&#146; fashionista friends tuck into crispy soft-shelled crabs served with a thick shower of pomelo pearls and translucent chopped garlic, and sweet mango desserts.
Sticky Rice was featured in our recent <a href="http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/restaurants/feature/comfort-food-basic-instincts-nov-2007">Comfort Food - Basic Instincts - Where to Eat</a> feature.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The restaurant is tricked out in
Peranakan furniture and decorations,
which can be a tad garish, but the menu,
which is personally planned by executive chef
Patricia Lee, more than makes up for it. Many
regulars swear by the ayam bua keluak (small
$7.80, big $10.80), the essential Peranakan
stew made from chicken and Indonesian
black nut in a thick, spicy gravy that combines
all the different taste sensations: sweet,
salty, bitter and sour. But we say try the kepetin
bak wan ($8.80), a rich broth which comes
with generous helping of juicy balls of crabmeat,
tofu and minced pork, sprinkled with
grated bamboo shoots.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This lovely little restaurant is a
little tricky to fi nd, as it’s tucked
behind the hawker stalls lining Smith Street,
but it’s worth the hunt. Nepalese food in some
ways is similar to Indian (and the restaurant sells
that cuisine as well), with pungent spices and
fl avourful rice. For vegetarians, the palungo ko
saag is a knockout: spinach sautéed with cumin
seeds ($6.50). Carnivorous types should try the
pro kukhura ko masu, which is a Nepalese chilli
chicken dish. Or go for the momo ($8), which
looks like a Nepalese version of fried Chinese
dumplings, fi lled with minced meat and veggies.
It’s listed as an appetiser, but one serving can
really fi ll you up.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Featuring an al fresco dining
space, this restaurant offers huge
portions of Moroccan specialities at a tiny
price. A fusion of European and African food,
the cuisine is known for its extensive use of
North African spices (such as cumin, coriander,
saffron, chillis and cinnamon) in tandem
with almond and pistachio nuts. The most
expensive dish is just $6.50, and most can be
had for less than $5. Run by a local Malay lady
and her Moroccan husband, the Deli offersfriendly and prompt service and piping hot
food served in a traditional earthenware tagine
(the name for both pot and dish). Don’t miss the
Moroccan apple drink – a sweet, cold, blended
shake with milk and cinnamon – and the traditional
hot apple tea, which is considered
an art form in Morocco. Pair either with
Koofta tagin (beef stewed in an earthenware
pot, $5.50) or the Moroccan
beef kebab ($4). 30]]></description>

And because the food comes in generousportions, this appetiser makes for a great lightmeal. Or, since this is Mexico, you could skip solidfood altogether and go right for the liquid lunch.Iguana has a bar full of 100 per cent blue agavetequilas, so fill up on a potent shot of the Cabrito Blanco or Cabrito Reposado ($9.99 each). Evenbetter, house pours are half price from openinguntil 9pm and midnight till closing]]></description>

What appears to be a normal salmon don is given a little Singaporean lift with the help of crunchy spring onions and a zing of chilli, moulded together with some sesame oil. At $10.80, it is a little over the budget, but in return you&#146;ll taste a truly original (and tasty) dish that you won&#146;t be able to find elsewhere in or out of Singapore. We say pay the damn 80 cents.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[At Piper’s, the pies are handmade
daily and baked on the premises. Go
for the hefty Piper’s Special made of 100 per
cent lean Aussie beef encased in a fl aky pie
shell ($6), and the classic coconut-fl ecked
chocolate lamington ($2.80).]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[If you get d&#233;j&#224; vu here, it&#146;s because many of the staff &#150; including the sinseh ($10 for a basic consultation) and Doris Ho, the manager &#150; used to work at the Metropole Hotel&#146;s Imprial Herbal Restaurant. Try the quick-fried shredded snakehead fish with gelatinous wai san, and the pears poached with a dusting of fritillary powder.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Back in 1988, Wang-Lee Tee Eng spotted a niche market in Singapore. She opened Imperial Herbal in her family-owned hotel, the Metropole on Seah Street and never looked back. Over the years, she has infused her menu with all manner of exotica, of which the deer penis soup is probably the most confrontational.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[There are several outlets, but it&#146;s hard to beat the one on Scotts Road for its kitsch interiors, modelled after a traditional Chinese home. These are almost unnecessary distractions from the very good menu stuffed with comfort food. Bestsellers are the intensely flavoured double-boiled herbal soups.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This is the first restaurant by herbal big wigs Eu Yan Sang. The kitchen cleverly deconstructs traditional tonics and soups, and reassembles the ingredients in modern Western dishes such as baby prawns with sweet honeysuckle flowers, risotto blended with tremella, and grilled vegetables mixed with crisp lotus roots.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The interior decoration, haloed with fluorescent
light, is decidedly spartan and uninviting,
but who cares, because the food here is
fantastic. Peranakan owner and chef Helen
Sugiano Sim hails from Indonesia and so her
menu is overlaid with an additional layer of
intense flavour. Everything from the buah
keluak to the sambal kangkong and golden,
coconut-infused chicken curry is worthy of
multiple helpings. Watch out for the layered
kueh lapis which is flown in from Sim’s aunt’s
kitchen in Indonesia. It’s sinfully good.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[What a lovely space! Brown cowhide runs along the length of the ceiling and down one wall, while low lighting and rich brown leather banquettes framed by mirrors and dirty-blond Tamarind wood counters complete the low-key deluxe look. Meanwhile, the pizza dough &#150; made from rocket leaves, or coloured purple-black with squid ink, or threaded with chilli and tomatoes &#150; emerge from the oven topped with everything from Gorgonzola and luscious green arugula to tiny forest mushrooms and white streaks of feta.

				<description><![CDATA[A dyed-in-the-wool local institution, Samy&#146;s is as low-maintenance as they come. It&#146;s more of a mess hall than a restaurant with its high ceilings, shuttered windows and ceiling fans. In place of plates are banana leaves, onto which servers slop mounds of aromatic, richly flavoured and head-hurting hot curries. Cool down with some fresh lime juice.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The decor (complete with wooden stools and mood lighting) is a little kitsch, prompting flashbacks to &#145;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&#146;, but the menu is faultless. The roast Peking duck is a standout, the skin crisp and the doughy wraps just-so. It&#146;s also hard to pass up the onion-flecked pancakes, fried noodles and luminous cubes of tofu braised in a black bean sauce and finely minced pork.

				<description><![CDATA[The shelves of organic goodies may be gone, but the former Yogi Hub still brings in a mixed crowd of aunties, Buddhist nuns and the arty set &#150; all smacking their collective lips at the eclectic vegetarian menu and organic fruit juices (try the red cabbage and grapes). The petai fried rice is an unexpectedly wonderful blend of bitter nuts, carrots, brown rice and sambal, while the tofu claypot &#150; filled with gingko nuts, bamboo shoots and asparagus &#150; is the best kind of comfort food. As is the walnut cheesecake.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This tiny little café inside Acts, a Christian
bookstore, serves up unexpectedly good
set meals at very reasonable prices. Staples
include fish and chips, a special of the day
(sometimes oxtail, sometimes pasta), and
our favourite: pan-seared Pacific Dory with
a creamy mushroom sauce, crunchy French
beans in a tangy tomato jus, and delicately
buttery pomme noisettes. Leave room for a

				<description><![CDATA[At Quentin Pereira&#146;s eponymous new digs, the menu brims with luscious Eurasian dishes cooked according to recipes handed down by his late grandmother. Intense and distinct flavours mark every course without a hint of hesitancy in the assembly of spices and execution. The patchri &#150; halflogs of purple-skinned brinjal slathered in a deep mahogany paste of tamarind, sugar, onions and ginger &#150; melts in the mouth, as do the bostador prawns &#150; succulent, ruby-red crescents dressed in a sharp blend of turmeric, belachan and chilli.]]></description>

Share the karisik kebab, a large copper platter of  combination kebabs including charcoal-grilled lamb chops and served with tender chunks of  grilled chili, pilaf  and rich buttery vegetables. For a postprandial treat, sit outside and puff  a strawberry-flavoured shisha.]]></description>

The flavours ring true, the high notes of sour, sweet, salty and chili heat recalling all that is good in Thai cuisine. House specials include a nasal-clearing tom yam, jade-green curries perfumed with lemongrass, delicately stuffed chicken wings, rice crackers topped with a coconutty pork mince, and fish steamed in chilis.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The breakfast experience doesn&#146;t get any more authentic than this. For 60 years, generations of loyal, local residents have been turning up at Chin Mee Chin for their morning kick-start of jet-black coffee (served in the traditional porcelain cups, thank you) and soft-boiled eggs. Don&#146;t miss the thick slabs of toast that are slathered with butter and a side slathering of kaya. Take a taxi.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[The platinum blond and ever-smiling Belgium chef  Emmanuel Stroobant is the closest thing Singapore has to a celebrity chef. The restaurant made its name with an astonishing foie gras menu, but these days its aggressively French tastes are tempered with Asian inflections, such as lobster with yuzu-green tarts, scallops and seaweed oil, wild kiniko mushroom soup, and a sailboat of  filo and wasabi-scented wild barramundi served with grilled aubergines and pine nuts.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[With its new and more visible location, it&#146;s business as usual at Sage. The dining room&#146;s grey palette and small but well thought-out mod French/Italian menu attract a mix of suits and ladies who lunch, though the rather uncomfortable chairs don&#146;t encourage lingering. The crab salad sits in a pool of gazpacho and is made of avocado, olives, firm and chunks of meat, cut with the crunch of celeriac and onion. Though the prawn carbonara is more a prawn mee thickened with egg and prawn oil than a carbonara, it&#146;s a nice twist to the usual version. Especially good is the veal cheek braised in a thick and rich porcini sauce. The set lunch starts from $38.

				<description><![CDATA[The small dining room – when you finally find it in the rabbit warren of  Cuppage Plaza – is claustrophobic, the seats aren’t very comfortable and bodies are squashed together, but on most nights, you can’t get a spare table for love or money. The draw here is yakitori – deliciously fresh ingredients barbecued on bamboo spears. Try the lightly salted foie gras, chicken meat balls blended with chunks of  black mushrooms, moist chicken wings dipped in salt and marbled Wagyu beef. Reservations are essential on the weekend.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[You have to love a restaurant where your order lands on the table almost as soon as you&#146;ve handed the menu back to the waiter. The lunch menu offers great value: a set course of  fried chicken, braised salmon, rice, salad and miso for about $14. The quality of  the cooking is consistently flawless: no wonder the place is packed with hurried locals and Japanese expats.

				<description><![CDATA[The private dining booths at the rear of  Rakuzen are appealing, but the best seats in the house are at the long counter. Here, chefs dish out seasonal specials such as delicately grilled Pacific sardines marinated in sake, rare forest mushrooms, firm-fleshed toro, sea-eel tempura and incredible loops of  snowy udon dipped in a soy jus thickened with onions and ginger. The house special is the nutty, fragrant Japanese rice, milled fresh each morning.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[With a name like this, it’s unsettling to walk into a space so distinctly mod-Japanese. There are comfy couches, and walls lined with floor-to-ceiling anime books and Japanese magazines. But it’s the little café to the side that holds the attention. There are curries (Japanese-style, which is to say not a hint of  heat), tonkatsu sets and lovely bricks of  tofu and soya sauce. The Japanese regulars tell the story.

				<description><![CDATA[Shiraz has not lost the romantic ambience, with its peaked archways, floral tiles and glowing lanterns. In-house entertainment is also provided with a show kitchen. For appetisers, the house platter is a greedy way to try a selection of mezes: delicate and creamy saut&#233;ed spinach is given a kick with a simple sprinkle of shallots; a shower of tart pomegranate jewels offsets the subtle pungency of tender lamb meat balls; while the seared perfume of roasted eggplant is perfectly paired with sweet streaks of mint and fried-onion flecks. The tomato-based lamb stew snuggles up perfectly against cumin-scented shards of braised okra and a small mountain of saffron-tinged rice. The combination of flavours, colours and textures is still being achieved with flying colours. Beware, it&#146;s tempting to sit here all night and keep ordering.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[La Strada&#146;s recent renovations added a bar to the space, but the spotlight still shines on Aussie chef Leandro Panza&#146;s modern Italian menu. The tagliatelle ragu is an extraordinary blend of pork, veal and beef cooked first in tomato and milk, and finished in the oven. Also superb is the large slab of ravioli filled with foie gras and an entire cut of quail; the rust-red stew of fat clams and mussels in an intensely flavoured tomato base; and fork-tender spring chicken. For desserts, the uplifting tiramisu is rich with liqueur; the cheesecake features a brittle, saltish, crisp base; while the chocolate cake is worth the trip in itself. All this is backed by flawless service.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Deep in the suburbs, Valentino&#146;s is a family-run trattoria where the squid-ink pasta, golden carbonara and paper-thin slices of pork loin braised in a stock of white wine, garlic and bay leaves are served up with brio. The Milan-born chef spent many years cooking in Tuscany and something of the Tuscan penchant for food with sunny colours, dense with flavours and simply prepared vegetables obviously wore off. That said, the dessert trolley, while looking temptingly luscious, is usually a let-down.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Rijsttafel is a Dutch-Indonesian hybrid of a buffet, but served to guests at the table all at once. Rice Table loads up on a never-ending flow of little plates filled with an astonishing range of meats, vegetables and flavours: satay, tahu telor, turmeric-tinged chicken curry, otah-otah, fried potato dumplings, thick rust-coloured beef rendang and more. At lunch, expect around 14 dishes, and a gut-busting 20 at dinner. The service is fast and furious, and it&#146;s easily one of the best value meals in town.&#160;<br />

				<description><![CDATA[Ignore the drab setting: the bowels of  a shopping centre, surrounded by hair salons and reflexologists. What appeals is the decent, cheap food. The Javanese street food menu is, for such a small restaurant, surprisingly comprehensive. There is sunny curry chicken, fried fish in tart assam sauce, and mounds of  gadogado blanketed by crisp prawn crackers and a mild Surabayan peanut gravy. Service can be absent-minded, but at these prices, who cares? ]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[This family-run restaurant has been rattling around since 1929 and is still going strong. Classical and comfortingly familiar, it takes few wrong turns: the suckling pig, Peking duck, chili Sri Lankan crabs and crisp roast chicken all fly from the kitchen at a dizzying pace. A must-try are the golden cereal prawns: huge, sweetly salty crustaceans encrusted with oatmeal flakes.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Long Beach has been there since anyone can remember, and judging from the weekend crowds of multi-generational families, it will be around for the long haul. Don&#146;t be distracted by the other goodies piled high on surrounding tables. Just concentrate on the huge Sri Lankan crabs doused with a molten, eggy, tart, tongue-singeing gravy. The other favourite is the black pepper crab, here doused with jet-black gravy. Mop it all up with crisply fried mantou dumplings.]]></description>

Scrumptious dim sum includes deep-fried yam pastries, saut&#233;ed snake beans and rice-flour rolls stuffed with prawns. On the &#224; la carte menu, the steamed fish is excellent.

				<description><![CDATA[The hotel foyer has seen far better days, but tucked away on the second floor, Hua Ting exudes a deluxe vibe that continues to lure a crowd of  suits, high-society types and longtime fans. The service glides along effortlessly while the Canto menu just pops. If  there&#146;s an expense account, lay it out for the thick, milky and politically incorrect double-boiled shark&#146;s cartilage soup.

Any meal should include the silky tofu served in a sauce of dried scallops and shiitake mushrooms; an addictively crisp brinjal crowned with pork floss; and round discs of lotus root fried with black pepper. Portions come in the usual three options, but the smallest is enough to feed three to four comfortably. We hear the PM&#146;s wife has been spotted here.]]></description>

The menu is a mix of western burgers and hawker standards (at hotel-adjusted prices), though most people come here really for the Hainanese chicken rice. The latter is marked by marvellously oiled rice and softly poached chicken paired with the classic trio of dark soy, garlic-infused chilli and grated ginger dips. Particularly good is the seafood char kway teow, here presented with a wok-seared flavour and the lovely undertow of pork fat.]]></description>
