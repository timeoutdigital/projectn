      <review><![CDATA[Knight and Day is an action movie of the old school before everything was about massive digital battles royal. Superspy Tom Cruise fends off trained assassins without ever losing his trademark grin. Cameron Diaz is the innocent bystander swept up into his world of international intrigue when he uses her to get something past airport customs. They careen from Kansas to Boston to Switzerland to Spain with Central Intelligence Agency agents who think he’s gone rogue in hot pursuit. Between the magical cell phones that can deactivate car alarms, the surviving of an airliner crash in a cornfield and the astonishingly bad aim of the machine-gun-wielding baddies, this is a film that asks us to skip past suspending disbelief and go straight to expulsion.It’s a measure of how lumbering action movies have been of late that this works at all. Cruise’s weird mix of earnest concern and roguish flirtation gives his character an amusing topspin. Diaz does what she can, but she’s asked to be both a resourceful, classic-car-fixin’ mechanic and the screaming girl of so many action movies. There are some inspired moments thrown in amid all the running and shooting, but they feel like truffle shavings on a Big Mac. - Hank Sartin]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA["What a difference a decade makes. The last time M Night Shyamalan tried to form a franchise, he made the idiosyncratic and relatively unpopular superhero story Unbreakable (2000). His adaptation of the popular Nickelodeon animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender  plays like a rejoinder to that film’s perceived flaws, which means that it’s been leeched of all personality and given a hack-blockbuster burnish. Any computer could have directed this mythological mishmash about a reincarnated boy named Aang (Noah Ringer) and his fairy-tale quest to master the sorta-martial art called bending. Just strike a lot of fancy, Far East-flavoured poses, and control over the four elements – earth, air, fire and water – is yours.
It’s a hell of a party trick, though Shyamalan visualises Aang’s otherworldly powers with dull detachment. The camera swoops and the music blares, but we might as well be watching a tolerant parent filming his son’s karate class demonstration. Only Slumdog Millionaire’s Dev Patel, as the bastard prince of the villainous Fire nation, truly gets jiggy with the fantasy. A cliff-hanger ending, meanwhile, portends a series of sequels (this is but “Book One”). I smell another Golden Compass]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Early on in I Hate Luv Storys, Sammir Soni, who plays a filmmaker, says that his upcoming movie is “not a love story, it’s a saga”. So in life. I Hate Luv Storys stretches on and on and, despite its best intentions, says nothing new about Bollywood’s treatment of love and relationships. Director Punit Malhotra’s debut film pretends to mock Bollywood’s formulaic and fluffy romances, but the movie ultimately confirms the power of mush. Cocky and cynical assistant director J (Imran Khan) despises the way Hindi movies depict romance. But he meets his match in Simran (Sonam Kapoor), a production designer who fervently believes that reel love is real. Like in any filmi story, J and Simran initially argue a lot but become fast friends. Simran mistakes their closeness for love. J blames her obsession with the movies for the awkward turn of events. Malhotra, who also wrote the screenplay and dialogue, manages to draw some laughs by spoofing hit romances such as Dilwale Dulhania Le Jaayenge, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (directed by I Hate Luv Storys producer Karan Johar), Dil Chahta Hai and Hum Tum. However, it doesn’t take long for the comedy bits to go off the rails, while the dramatic scenes fall flat in the second half. The attractive-looking lead pair have a charming screen presence and their repartee will amuse young viewers, but little else memorable transpires between them. Imran Khan gets some good lines but isn’t convincing as a womaniser. Kapoor does little more than flash toothy smiles. If Malhotra had focused as much on the script as on the sets and the wardrobe, this love story might have been more worthwhile. - Suhani Singh]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[“Bella, they're not even alive,” Jacob (Taylor Lautner) whimpers when he learns his improbable love interest (KristenStewart) has once again forsaken him and his lupine clan for the dependable lapdog of the undead (Robert Pattinson), and to the extent that The Twilight Saga: Eclipse is more tolerable than its predecessors, it is for giving its mannequins a semblance of anger and disappointment. Or maybe this time, the actors have just been directed to look interested. Clearly, Jacob of the congenital shirtlessness and Edward of the vacant stare can’t both have their way with Bella of the eternal pout, and as they size each other up in a freezing tent – with Edward spiteful over Jacob’s ability to keep Bella warm – there is the sense that Eclipse is good campy fun, or at least fodder for theorists and werewolf therapists.Director David Slade varies the pace and the rhythm a bit, knowing that when you’re stuck with two exasperatingly dull (and chaste) main characters, the best thing to do is to get away from them whenever possible. Eclipse rouses from its photo-shoot torpor during brief flashbacks to the Civil War and the 1930s; material involving the supporting cast (including an underused Bryce Dallas Howard) suggests Slade as a passing student of Kathryn Bigelow’s Near Dark. But Stephenie Meyer’s mythology is too thin to withstand the ponderous approach borrowed from adaptations of JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis, and its heroine’s appeal is never even established, let alone timeless]]></review>
