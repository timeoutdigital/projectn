      <review><![CDATA[Knight and Day is an action movie of the old school before everything was about massive digital battles royal. Superspy Tom Cruise fends off trained assassins without ever losing his trademark grin. Cameron Diaz is the innocent bystander swept up into his world of international intrigue when he uses her to get something past airport customs. They careen from Kansas to Boston to Switzerland to Spain with Central Intelligence Agency agents who think he’s gone rogue in hot pursuit. Between the magical cell phones that can deactivate car alarms, the surviving of an airliner crash in a cornfield and the astonishingly bad aim of the machine-gun-wielding baddies, this is a film that asks us to skip past suspending disbelief and go straight to expulsion.It’s a measure of how lumbering action movies have been of late that this works at all. Cruise’s weird mix of earnest concern and roguish flirtation gives his character an amusing topspin. Diaz does what she can, but she’s asked to be both a resourceful, classic-car-fixin’ mechanic and the screaming girl of so many action movies. There are some inspired moments thrown in amid all the running and shooting, but they feel like truffle shavings on a Big Mac. - Hank Sartin]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA["What a difference a decade makes. The last time M Night Shyamalan tried to form a franchise, he made the idiosyncratic and relatively unpopular superhero story Unbreakable (2000). His adaptation of the popular Nickelodeon animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender  plays like a rejoinder to that film’s perceived flaws, which means that it’s been leeched of all personality and given a hack-blockbuster burnish. Any computer could have directed this mythological mishmash about a reincarnated boy named Aang (Noah Ringer) and his fairy-tale quest to master the sorta-martial art called bending. Just strike a lot of fancy, Far East-flavoured poses, and control over the four elements – earth, air, fire and water – is yours.
It’s a hell of a party trick, though Shyamalan visualises Aang’s otherworldly powers with dull detachment. The camera swoops and the music blares, but we might as well be watching a tolerant parent filming his son’s karate class demonstration. Only Slumdog Millionaire’s Dev Patel, as the bastard prince of the villainous Fire nation, truly gets jiggy with the fantasy. A cliff-hanger ending, meanwhile, portends a series of sequels (this is but “Book One”). I smell another Golden Compass]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Early on in I Hate Luv Storys, Sammir Soni, who plays a filmmaker, says that his upcoming movie is “not a love story, it’s a saga”. So in life. I Hate Luv Storys stretches on and on and, despite its best intentions, says nothing new about Bollywood’s treatment of love and relationships. Director Punit Malhotra’s debut film pretends to mock Bollywood’s formulaic and fluffy romances, but the movie ultimately confirms the power of mush. Cocky and cynical assistant director J (Imran Khan) despises the way Hindi movies depict romance. But he meets his match in Simran (Sonam Kapoor), a production designer who fervently believes that reel love is real. Like in any filmi story, J and Simran initially argue a lot but become fast friends. Simran mistakes their closeness for love. J blames her obsession with the movies for the awkward turn of events. Malhotra, who also wrote the screenplay and dialogue, manages to draw some laughs by spoofing hit romances such as Dilwale Dulhania Le Jaayenge, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (directed by I Hate Luv Storys producer Karan Johar), Dil Chahta Hai and Hum Tum. However, it doesn’t take long for the comedy bits to go off the rails, while the dramatic scenes fall flat in the second half. The attractive-looking lead pair have a charming screen presence and their repartee will amuse young viewers, but little else memorable transpires between them. Imran Khan gets some good lines but isn’t convincing as a womaniser. Kapoor does little more than flash toothy smiles. If Malhotra had focused as much on the script as on the sets and the wardrobe, this love story might have been more worthwhile. - Suhani Singh]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[“Bella, they're not even alive,” Jacob (Taylor Lautner) whimpers when he learns his improbable love interest (KristenStewart) has once again forsaken him and his lupine clan for the dependable lapdog of the undead (Robert Pattinson), and to the extent that The Twilight Saga: Eclipse is more tolerable than its predecessors, it is for giving its mannequins a semblance of anger and disappointment. Or maybe this time, the actors have just been directed to look interested. Clearly, Jacob of the congenital shirtlessness and Edward of the vacant stare can’t both have their way with Bella of the eternal pout, and as they size each other up in a freezing tent – with Edward spiteful over Jacob’s ability to keep Bella warm – there is the sense that Eclipse is good campy fun, or at least fodder for theorists and werewolf therapists.Director David Slade varies the pace and the rhythm a bit, knowing that when you’re stuck with two exasperatingly dull (and chaste) main characters, the best thing to do is to get away from them whenever possible. Eclipse rouses from its photo-shoot torpor during brief flashbacks to the Civil War and the 1930s; material involving the supporting cast (including an underused Bryce Dallas Howard) suggests Slade as a passing student of Kathryn Bigelow’s Near Dark. But Stephenie Meyer’s mythology is too thin to withstand the ponderous approach borrowed from adaptations of JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis, and its heroine’s appeal is never even established, let alone timeless]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[No one’s coming to a big-screen version of the lunkheaded American television show expecting The Hurt Locker. But would it have killed the editors to let a single shot breathe for more than two seconds? Diced into hash, the action sequences are unusually painful: poundingly loud and punctuated by Liam Neeson’s bark, Bradley Cooper’s manic heehawing and a total lack of clarity. Does it matter if the elite squad is squaring off against some shady CIA tools and mercenaries? The smidgen of topicality is buried under tons of noise. - Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Jon Harris says his routine sequel is a “seamless continuation” of Neil Marshall's heart-stopping survival horror movie, in which six female friends were attacked in an Appalachian cave system by mutant, flesh-eating monsters. Traumatised, amnesiac survivor Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) is ordered back underground by a sceptical local sheriff and sets off with the lawman, his female deputy and a three-person rescue team. The first hint of what happened to the five missing women is glimpsed on a video camera's playback; then the party is attacked by a new breed of ferocious crawlers. Simon Bowles’s subterranean sets and Sam McCurdy’s stygian cinematography create a suitably terrifying atmosphere, but ex-editor Jon Harris’s direction is messy, favouring confusing set-piece scares over the all-important group dynamics. Also, the opportunistic resurrection of the (presumed) dead Juno (Natalie Mendoza) is lazy and insulting, and the abrupt, nihilistic ending is in no way earned. - Nigel Floyd]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[We may have moved from veiled Cold War to explicit global terror in the 25 years since the excellent, UK-set nuclear conspiracy thriller Edge of Darkness first aired on the BBC, directed by Martin Campbell (Casino Royale) and written by Troy Kennedy Martin. It’s also been some eight, traumatic post-9/11 years since Mel Gibson’s last thespian outing in M Night Shyamalan’s Signs. But time seems to have stood still in Campbell’s drab remake for the big screen. In condensing the original mini-series into a conventional, two-hour package, scriptwriters William Monahan and Andrew Bovell have sadly sacrificed some of the original’s cultural specificity and its slow-burn quality. Craven (Mel Gibson), the widowed police officer whose engineer daughter (Bojana Novakovic) is gunned down on a home visit, is now one of the Boston police department’s finest. Gibson recalls the earnest intensity and investigative zeal of Bob Peck’s original performance, but he also brings a lot of unwanted manic mannerisms to the part. - Wally Hammond]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Let the record note that the martial art performed in this film is in fact kung fu. Karate is a Japanese discipline, which was fine for the 1984 original, with Noriyuki “Pat” Morita teaching Ralph Macchio the ways of karate. The 2010 reboot moves the action to China, which makes sense with star Jackie Chan as a new master and affords the opportunity for much scenic tourism. But The Kung-Fu Kid doesn’t have brand-name recognition, so The Karate Kid this film remains.The new version also skews younger with Jaden Smith as Dre, whose mother (Taraji P Henson, underutilised) has moved them from Detroit to China for a job in an auto factory (The idea that China is importing American auto-industry employees is a canard that must be discreetly overlooked under the “suspension of disbelief” audience-movie accords). It’s more plausible that a kid of 12 is the victim of bullying, though it does give the romantic pairing with a cute classmate (Wenwen Han) a bit of an icky too-young feeling. The movie remains a pretty painless piece of family entertainment, tapping into the primal urge to show up your oppressors in single combat. -  Hank Sartin]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The latest comic book to get a Hollywood going-over, The Losers is a growling, paranoid graphic novel about a renegade military unit transformed into a 12-certificate bro-out. Plugging into the zeitgeist for films about dark forces pulling strings in government, it opens with the unit carrying out covert black ops. They’re in Bolivia to do the CIA’s bidding, taking out a drugs baron. Only when they arrive, the baron is using children as mules. Their handler, Max – the puppet master orders them to strike regardless. Refusing, they come under attack from their own side, and presumed dead, disappear off into hiding promising payback. All the usual soldierly suspects are here: motormouth geek, family man, taciturn shooter, the really hard one – played perfectly decently by Chris Evans, Columbus Short, Oscar Jaenada and Idris Elba, with Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the colonel. There’s even a hot chick, Zoë Saldana, who handles weapons like a trooper, sometimes in her knickers. - Cath Clarke]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[After the family patriarch is paralysed by a stroke, the powerful Pratap clan is split down the middle. On one side is Prithvi (Arjun Rampal), more Sonny Corleone than Yudhishtra, and his brother Samar (Ranbir Kapoor), the movie’s Arjun/Michael Corleone. Brij Mohan (Nana Patekar) is Krishna, Samar’s sensei in statecraft. On the other side is Virendra or Duryodhana (Manoj Bajpai), who seeks revenge for being denied what he believes is his rightful share of the legacy. Virendra’slieutenant is Suraj (Ajay Devgn), a Dalit leader modelled on Karna. Anybody with even a cursory knowledge of the Mahabharata and The Godfather will knows what happens next. Samar, who is studying for a PhD in nineteenth-century poetry, morphs into a master strategist to save his brother’s political career. There are no friends, only allies in this morally empty world. Samar exploits his childhood acquaintance Indu (Katrina Kaif) to secure her wealthy father’s financial backing. The secret of Suraj’s birth – he’s the illegitimate son of the mother (Nikhila Trikha) of Samar and Prithvi – becomes a bargaining chip.  Samar is cruel and manipulative, but he is played by Ranbir Kapoor, so he must be an unlikely hero. - Nandini Ramnath]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Outlaw Beera (Abhishek Bachchan) kidnaps Ragini (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) and spirits her away to his gorgeous jungle lair. Ragini’s husband Dev (Vikram), a superintendent of police, follows in hot pursuit. Taking visual cues from Akira Kurosawa’s samurai-themed films, Francis Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now and Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Ratnam and his cinematographers (V Manikandan and Santosh Sivan) burrow deep into a rain-soaked forest that is a metaphorical refuge from the law and the strictures of society. Beera has something of a back story – he is seeking revenge for the gang-rape by policemen of his half-sister Jamuniya (Priyamani), which drove her to commit suicide. However, Beera is a mostly blank screen onto which Ratnam projects one of his pet themes: the celebration of the anti-hero. Beera’s rage against the system makes even more sense in the Tamil version, which refers to age-old caste tensions in Tamil Nadu. (Ratnam made two versions of the film, with Vikram playing Beera in the Tamil one.) While Ratnam’s fluid story-telling style is in full flow in the Tamil version, he seems adrift with an unfamiliar language and a cast in Raavan. The Hindi movie is much weaker than the Tamil version, which is powered by a mesmeric performance by Vikram.  Bachchan, in contrast, overacts furiously and treats the whole thing as one big joke. -  Nandini Ramnath]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Sunnyside, the day-care centre where the delightful new Toy Story occurs, might be a paradise – especially for Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz (voiced by Tim Allen) and a gang facing obsolescence. (Andy is off to college and his mom has broken out the Hefty bags.) But in the sternly orotund warning of one Mr Pricklepants (ex-Bond Timothy Dalton), it’s “a place of ruin and despair”, peopled with violent, drooling tykes and ruled with a plush fist by Lots-o’-Huggin’ Bear (voiced by the extraordinary Ned Beatty), whose strawberry scent and harmonica-swaddled folksiness hide a sadist.Clearly, Pixar’s genius for adventurous storytelling continues unabated. As always, the fun with this franchise comes from elaborate sequences of escape, stressing the plastic, resourceful nature of our heroes. - Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Alfred Hitchcock’s sleek, wry, paranoid 1959 thriller caught the zeitgeist perfectly: Cold War shadiness, secret agents of power, urbane modernism, the ant-like bustle of city life, and a hint of dread behind the sharp suits of affluence. Cary Grant’s Roger Thornhill is the film’s sharply dressed ad exec who is sucked into a vortex of mistaken identity. Hitchcock breezes through a tongue-in-cheek, nightmarish plot with a lightness of touch that’s equalled by a charming performance from Grant, who copes effortlessly with the script’s dash between claustrophobia and intrigue on one hand and romance and comedy on the other.

      <review><![CDATA[Based on the Reverend Thomas Dixon Jr’s deliriously racist The Clansman, a melodramatic novel about the American Civil War and its aftermath, DW Griffith’s 1915 film is remarkable for its technical innovations and for the truly epic feel created by the carefully orchestrated, swirling masses of figures in the battle scenes. It’s also remarkable for having had no written scenario, costumes that were made by actor Lillian Gish’s mother, battle scenes that were shot in a day, and a cost that meant Griffith had nothing left but the shirt on his back. The biggest challenge the film provided for its audiences is perhaps to decide when “ground-breaking, dedicated, serious cinematic art” must be reviled as politically reprehensible.

      <review><![CDATA[Bruno Bonomo (Silvio Orlando), a flailing producer of B-movies, reluctantly agrees to back a cinematic attack on Silvio Berlusconi when young writer-director Teresa (Jasmine Trinca) thrusts her script into his hands. It’s only when he begins the soul-destroying process of finding financiers and actors that he warms a little to Teresa’s cause. His mild awakening is superceded by a personal crisis: not only is his career in tatters, but he and his wife (Margherita Buy) are separating. As he struggles to balance family and work, we see some imagined scenes from his Berlusconi film, each reflecting a different stage in its production and each showing Berlusconi played by a different actor, including director Nanni Moretti himself. Moretti’s portrait of a loser lingering in the doldrums of Italian cinema is wittily scripted and lightly played.

      <review><![CDATA[Santosh Sivan’s Before the Rains is a solid if unmemorable slice of culture-clash melodrama. Revisiting timeworn Merchant Ivory themes – forbidden love, cultural displacement and colonial misadventure – the film attempts to reflect the wider imperial conflict through a tightly focused story of one village and its strained relationship with its British overseers. Linus Roache is understretched in the role of Moores, a spice planter locked in a turbulent affair with his housegirl (Nandita Das). The more showy role goes to Rahul Bose as his disapproving manservant, TK, whose knowledge of his master’s indiscretions leads him into an ideological struggle between friendship and national identity. The film’s main strength lies in the relationships between its characters – each make terrible but understandable decisions that lead to tragedy, but none ever appears as an outright villain. Only towards the end does this careful balance become unstuck, leading to a contrived finalé that wraps up the story without offering any satisfying emotional conclusions. - Tom Huddleston.

      <review><![CDATA["All three of you clamouring for a sequel to Wild Wild West have got your wish. Jonah Hex, an adaptation of the DC Comics series about a Western antihero with otherworldly abilities, gives that Fresh Prince-starring disaster from 1999 a run for its wasted money. Occupying a similarly alternate nineteenth-century universe, Hex (Josh Brolin) is a horribly scarred bounty hunter out for the blood of the man who murdered his family, Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich). But it’s not simply a matter of revenge, since Turnbull has a monomaniacal plan to use a weapon of mass destruction against President Ulysses S Grant (Aidan Quinn).
What’s a guy who can interrogate the dead to do? Sleep with Megan Fox, of course. Then it’s off on a progression of adventures that reach their apex when a group of Indians brings Hex back from the beyond. He inhales some digital smoke, coughs up a crow and shouts a Shatneresque “Turnbull!!!” Then? Howzabout a rushed steamboat-of-death finale involving the plastic-bag-loving videographer from American Beauty and Gob Bluth from Arrested Development? But by that point you’ll hopefully be passed out from all the pocket-flask shots you’ve swigged to survive this hex of a flick.

      <review><![CDATA["Bollywood does Kashmir in Lamhaa, and the results are quite predictable. Each of the three stars in the movie gets a proper Bollywood-style introduction. When we first see Sanjay Dutt, an undercover officer who is trying to uncover a terrorist plot in Kashmir, he’s walking in slow motion towards the camera. Bipasha Basu, a fiery insurgent, makes her appearance slashing a man’s throat and escaping over the rooftops with the ease of Supergirl. Kunaal Kapoor, a former militant turned peacenik politician, comes into view on a bike, the wind ruffling his curls. 
Lamhaa treats the Kashmir conflict with just as much subtlety. Director Rahul Dholakia tries to be hard-hitting, but the movie is actually bludgeoning in its impact. The hysterical pitch 
is intensified by the jerky camerawork and choppy editing. 
The movie follows the efforts of intelligence agent Jahangir (Dutt) to unravel a plot to cause mayhem in the Valley. He recruits Aziza (Basu), the ward of radical ideologue Haji Shah (Anupam Kher), who is modelled on Syed Geelani. Aziza’s half-baked love interest is Aatif (Kapoor), a moderate politician who is contesting elections in the state. Dholakia, who has previously made the superior Parzania, confirms every conspiracy theory about Kashmir. The mosques harbour fundamentalists. Children are being recruited by the thousand to become suicide bombers. Politicians and senior Army officers are conspiring to keep the state on the boil. Kohl-eyed insurgents are standing at every corner. Missing from the movie is the ordinary Kashmiri. If Dholakia bleeds for anybody, it is for the Kashmiri Pandits, the majority of whom were driven out of their homes by militants.
Several characters keep referring to “1989” as though a single incident on the scale of 9/11 kicked off the self-determination struggle in the state. The tragedy about Kashmir is complex and ongoing and cannot be reduced to a few incidents or a handful of people. In attempting to explore the issues facing the Kashmiri people through the prism of a thriller, Dholakia misses the wood for the chinars. Nandini Ramnath"]]></review>

      <plot><![CDATA[After being abandoned for eight straight years in boarding school, Rohan returns to the small industrial town of Jamshedpur and finds himself closeted with an authoritarian father and a younger half brother who he didn't even know existed. Forced to work in his father's steel factory and study engineering against his wishes, he strives to forge his own life out of his given circumstances and pursue his dream of being a writer.]]></plot>
      <review><![CDATA["There are two types of Bollywood papas. One is sweet and portly (and often wealthy) and dotes on his children. The other is an overprotective obstacle to romance that is eventually surmounted. Vikramditya Motwane’s debut feature introduces a third type: a father who loathes his children. 
Udaan is set in Jamshedpur, the steel city. The appropriateness of the setting (nicely captured by Mahendra Shetty’s camerawork) becomes increasingly apparent as Bhairav Singh’s character is revealed. The alloy seems to have formed a cast around the factory owner’s heart, preventing him from treating his sons Rohan (Rajat Barmecha) and Arjun (Aayan Boradia) with warmth and empathy. Bhairav abuses his children verbally and physically. He crushes the poetic ambitions of his elder son and the playfulness of the younger one. Udaan is the story of Rohan’s flight to freedom, but more compelling than his repeated efforts to form a bond with his father and brother is Bhairav’s destructiveness. 
Motwane, who co-wrote Anurag Kashyap’s Dev.D, is better at setting up a problem than solving it. The story occasionally goes in circles, especially in the scenes showcasing yet another example of Bhairav’s malevolence. There’s an implausible and distracting track exploring Rohan’s friendship with Jamshedpur’s riff-raff. Motwane sets up Rohan’s dilemma admirably, but doesn’t seem quite sure how to resolve 
it, resulting in an ending that seems forced. 
Yet, Udaan flies on many counts. The movie tackles its themes with sobriety and honesty. Through the unrelentingly corrosive Bhairav, Motwane mounts a strong critique of the warped ideas of masculinity and familial duty that are commonplace in India. The cast performs beautifully. Barmecha looks the part and inhabits his role. Equally impressive is Aayan Boradia as his little brother and Ram Kapoor in a small but pivotal role as Bhairav’s saner brothers. But the scene stealer is Ronit Roy, who effortlessly embodies both menace and the bitterness of a lifetime of disappointments. Nandini Ramnath"]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA["This is the sequel that John McTiernan and Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 1987 original deserved, as director Nimrod Antal delivers enough hard core sci-fi, explosive action and monster mayhem to justify its belated arrival. Forget the official sequel and the lame Alien vs Predator spin-offs, this Predator sequel deserves one of its own. 
Armed to the teeth but unknown to one another, a multiracial group of military/criminal killers (plus Topher Grace’s anomalous wimpy doctor) find themselves on a Predator hunting planet where they are the game. Faced with an evolved generation of super-Predators, Adrien Brody’s Hemingway-quoting, self-appointed leader (“There is no hunting like the hunting of men”) insists that their survival depends upon pooling their own killer instincts. Alice Braga’s svelte sniper is a tough yet tender foil for the buff, brainy Brody; with one notable exception, the remaining “dirty half-dozen” are merely disposable. Channelling Marlon Brando’s unhinged Colonel Kurtz, a well-padded Laurence Fishburne pops up halfway through as a surprise sole survivor, a striking cameo that nods to his youthful debut in Apocalypse Now.

      <plot><![CDATA["Tere Bin Laden" is a tongue-in-cheek comedy about an ambitious young news reporter from Pakistan who is desperate to migrate to the US in pursuit of the American dream. His repeated attempts to immigrate are shot down as his visa is always rejected. But when things couldn't look worse he comes across an Osama bin Laden look alike. Ali then hatches a scheme to produce a fake Osama video and sell it to news channels as a breakthrough scoop! Unfortunately there are serious ramifications as the White House gets involved and dispatches a overzealous secret agent on Ali's trail.]]></plot>
      <review><![CDATA["Tere Bin Laden will instantly appeal to fans of the 1980s movies Peecha Karo and Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro and the more recent Sankat City. The movies share a flair for irreverence, sharp political humour and deliberate tackiness. Abhishek Sharma’s debut feature converts its modest budget into a style statement. Tere Bin Laden is about little people with big dreams who bumble about trying to realise their ambitions. Although Sharma’s satire doesn’t bite as sharply as Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro, he extracts some good-natured and timely humour from America’s War on Terror. 
The movie’s intrepid hero is Ali (Pakistani pop star Ali Zafar), a television reporter who is so desperate to emigrate to America that he tricks a chicken farmer (Pradhuman Singh Mall) into posing as Osama bin Laden for a video. Ali hopes that the video warning will become his ticket to the States. Instead, the Americans send an FBI agent (Barry John) to investigate the matter. Sharma, working with an enthusiastic cast, aims for chuckles rather than guffaws. Although the humour is simplistic and occasionally silly, the movie is well-plotted and undeniably funny. The cast seems to enjoy itself immensely: Ali Zafar is charming and convincing, Pradhuman Singh Mall is as broad as he needs to be and Barry John has a great time chomping on his vowels.

      <review><![CDATA["Milan Luthria’s period gangster movie, starring Ajay Devgn and Emraan Hashmi as rival crime bosses, has a pretentious Hollywoodesque title that belies its deep roots in 1970s Hindi cinema. It’s a mouthful for the working-class masses who adore both Devgn and Hashmi, but it isn’t unappealing enough to keep them away either. 
Devgn conquered the gangster persona in Company. Hashmi stakes his claim as the new don on the block, both in the movie and outside it. We never thought the day would arrive when we would praise Hashmi for being anything more than being an ardent kisser. But Luthria has excavated the acting chops from beneath Hashmi’s abs and put the actor’s bad boy image to superb use. 
Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai is loosely based on the life of Haji Mastan, whose journey from poverty in Panaikulam village in Tamil Nadu to power in Mumbai has already inspired several films, including as Yash Chopra’s Deewar and Mani Ratnam’s Nayakan (which drew from the stories of both Mastan and his Tamilian partner in crime, Dharavi don Vardarajan Mudaliar). Once Upon a Time outlines the rise of Sultan (Devgn), his marriage to a movie star (Kangana Ranaut) and his popularity among poor Muslims. Sultan’s reign is challenged by an upstart, Shoaib (Hashmi), who is modelled on Dawood Ibrahim. So far, so predictable. Ram Gopal Varma showed a similar thing – and much better – in Company eight years ago. 
The movie is set in the ’70s, but bouffant wigs and outsized goggles alone aren’t enough to count for authentic period detail. Randeep Hooda plays a cop who tries to turn the situation to the advantage of the police, but the plot strand isn’t 
adequately exploited. 
However, Once Upon a Time isn’t a lost cause. Luthria, who acquitted himself honourably in Kachche Dhaage and Taxi No 9211, combines briskness and style to make his weak story watchable. He directs his actors well and has given meaty roles to Ranaut and Prachi Desai, who plays Shoaib’s lady love Mumtaaz. But the crew member having the most fun is dialogue writer Rajat Aroraa. Every line is a punch line, aimed at extracting whistles from viewers. Luthria and Aroraa clearly hope to evoke the spirit of the Amitabh Bachchan films of the ’70s – it’s unfortunate that they forget to tell a well-rounded story in the process. Once Upon a Time has a sharp beginning, a sagging middle and an inconclusive end that promises a sequel. That means more of Hashmi’s newly discovered acting abilities and yet another chance for Aroraa to churn out aphorisms like there’s no tomorrow. Nandini Ramnath"]]></review>

If it sounds like a checklist of summer-camp activities that someone has tried to pass off as a movie – well, it is.
Simultaneously strained and bloated, Grown Ups follows five friends (Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, 
Rob Schneider) and their families (the wives include the absurdly overqualified Maya Rudolph, Maria Bello and Salma Hayek) as they return for their childhood basketball coach’s funeral. It seems this middling Saturday Night Live crowd has settled into a complacent Big Chill phase, with no sense of what separates the desperate (questionable gags involving Rock’s sassy, flatulent mother-in-law) from the edgy. Despite its title, Grown Ups has little to say about maturity. (The one funny running gag involves Hollywood agent Sandler’s hyperspoiled kids, who marvel over seeing a TV that isn’t flat-screen.)

To add to his woes, the new municipal commissioner, Gehna (Trisha Krishnan) is his ex-girlfriend. 
We haven’t seen the Malayali original, but we’re guessing that it was so funny it deserved to be remade. The Hindi version has about five funny but unmemorable jokes. The rest of the time, Priyadarshan’s direction is mechanical and mercenary. He assembles a large cast, gives each of them a few minutes in the spotlight and makes sure that the movie looks pretty (thanks to cinematographer V Manikandan, it does). Priyadarshan doesn’t seem to notice when actors like Manoj Joshi and Rajpal Yadav are hamming, or when the humour has run out of steam. He doesn’t seem to care either, since his movies have a dedicated audience and almost always make money.

      <review><![CDATA["We’ve come to a point where we ask very, very, very little – and usually receive even less – from blockbusters: Wow us with a few cool-looking creatures and keep the bodily-function gags at tolerable levels. By those pitiful standards, this Disney-sponsored mediocrity, about a wizard (Nicolas Cage) and his reluctant ward Jay (Baruchel) who must, naturally, save the world from evil – succeeds. You get to see both a Chrysler Building’s Art Deco eagle and the Bowling Green Bull come to life and wreak havoc, in all their computer-generated glory. There’s only one flatulent-dog joke, and the ol’ plasma-bolt-to-the-crotch gag is, mercifully, not milked. You won’t fall asleep before the credits or feel dirty afterward, unlike with some other big-budget megillahs this season. It whizzes by more quickly than you can say “Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer,” while also being magically devoid of anything resembling character, originality or distinction. 
Journeyman director Jon Turteltaub does to boy-conjurer flicks what he did to Indiana Jones adventures with the National Treasure franchise, boiling things down to their bare genre essence, while buffing the borrowed elements to a blinding sheen.  Everything from the baritone voiceover (“The wars of sorcerers have been fought throughout history!”) to Cage’s Obi-Wan-on-ludes act screams autopilot. David Fear"]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Debt-ridden farmers have been killing themselves by the hundred thousand over the last few years in Mumbai’s backyard, but Bollywood has been too busy scouting the world for new locations to notice. Marathi filmmakers have been far more sensitive – Gabharicha Paus, Tingya and Hapus have examined the rural crisis with empathy and black humour. Both qualities are available in spades in former NDTV24x7 journalist Anusha Rizvi’s Peepli Live, which takes the unfinished business of development in rural India into the multiplex. Peepli Live is about Natha (Omkar Das Manikpuri), who has defaulted on a bank loan and is in danger of losing his land. A stray remark by a local politician plants the seed of a crazy idea in the mind of Natha’s brother Budhia (Raghubir Yadav): if Natha kills himself, his family can use the compensation to get back the land. A local journalist (Nowazzudin) gets wind of Budhia’s scheme and writes about the issue. National television channels, led by Nandita Mullick (Mallika Shenoy), descend on Peepli and trample all over the place, shoving cameras into the faces of Peepli’s bemused residents. Natha’s tragedy is reduced to a farce of epic proportions.Peepli Live works strongest when Rizvi lampoons the tendency of television channels to sensationalise serious issues for the sake of ratings. Rizvi’s work experience comes handy in the fake news broadcasts being sent from Peepli – especially hilarious are the over-the-top bulletins of Hindi reporter Deepak (Vishal Sharma). Rizvi also casts her gaze on the insensitivity of politicians and government officials towards a group that is too marginal to count as a votebank or a pressure group. Her critique is simplistic at times, and the movie sags towards the end, but Peepli Live is carried on the shoulders of its talented cast, especially Raghubir Yadav and Vishal Sharma - Nandini Ramnath]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Jane Austen said that in Emma, she had created a character few people would like. Aisha, directed by Rajshree Ojha and adapted by Devika Bhagat’s from Austen’s classic, is about Bollywood’s own naïve and clueless girl-woman, Aisha (Sonam Kapoor). However, while Austen had pages to let the privileged matchmaker grow on you despite her frailties, Bhagat and Ojha rush us through Aisha’s reformation from an immature girl to a sensible woman,  giving viewers few reasons to embrace her. Aisha uses her meddling nose and credit card to fix her friends with partners of her choice. But what she perceives as “social work” is nothing but attempts to do as she pleases. It is her spotless investment banker-friend Arjun (Abhay Deol), modelled on George Knightley, who reprimands her for her wrongdoings and in process helps her grow up. While there is fine chemistry between the two, the movie doesn’t make a strong case for Arjun’s love for Aisha. Instead, the supporting cast steals the spotlight. Some of the movie’s best moments and dialogues belong to newcomer Amrita Puri as Shefali, the gullible middle-class girl from Haryana who has to adjust to the flighty world of upper-class Delhi. Meanwhile, Cyrus Sahukar’s Randhir and Anand Tiwari’s Saurabh are likeable in the limited screen time they get - Suhani Singh]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Francis Veber (La Cage Aux Folles) may be France’s longtime king of odd-couple farce, but the broad humour of his films rarely translates to Hollywood. In the only sporadically entertaining Dinner for Schmucks, director Jay Roach (Meet the Fockers) takes on Veber’s mean-spirited 1998 comedy The Dinner Game, about Parisian publishing pals who invite eccentric idiots to a meal before mockingly awarding the most “exceptional” guest. Outside of the specifically Gallic brand of condescending intellectualism, the Americanised version reconfigures the plot as both a hazing ritual for corporate-ladder-climbers and a lazy hook to hang cheap jokes on. Private equity analyst Tim Conrad (Paul Rudd) makes the right play at a staff meeting and is given the preliminary nod to a bump upstairs. First, though, he must attend the titular mansion party thrown by his boss. Tim brings oblivious IRS drone Barry (Steve Carell). The perfect companion for such a cruel soiree, Barry is a self-delusional, literal-minded simpleton whose innocent intentions become burdensome by the fact that he can’t take a hint. Once Tim is shackled to this deep-down lovable caricature, the mismatched buddy schtick with a tender resolution is on autopilot - Aaron Hillis]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Madholal (Subrat Dutta) is a jovial security guard who enjoys a simple life in a chawl with his wife and two daughters. A chunk of his daily life revolves around the local trains, in which he and his gang of friends catch up with each other. All is well until a bomb blast on the train leaves Madholal paralysed. With the sole breadwinner bedridden, the women struggle to run the household. Can Madholal overcome his fear of travelling in trains and get back on his feet? Director and writer Jay Tank’s debut offers a straightforward and earnest look at how a man’s life is wrecked by terrorism. Reminiscent of A Wednesday in its attempt to portray the frustrations of an ordinary man, the movie also depicts communal tension when Anwar (Pranay Narayan), a neighbour and friend of Madholal, is suspected as the mastermind behind the train blast. While the engaging first half sets up Madholal’s world nicely, the flaws emerge in the latter half when Tanks cooks up a half-baked whodunit and dwells on Madholal’s resilience far too long. The performances by a cast of mostly unfamiliar actors, however, add credence to the story. Although Madholal Keep Walking takes a hackneyed route, it often gives engaging glimpses of an ordinary Mumbaiite caught up in the chaos of the maximum city - Suhani Singh]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Nagesh Kukunoor hit a creative high with Iqbal and Dor a few years ago but then nosedived into Tasveer and Bombay to Bangkok. His latest film, Aashayein, takes him closer to the bottom. The movie is about a gambler who is diagnosed with lung cancer. Just as Rahul (John Abraham) wins `3 crores on a cricket match, he finds out that he only has three months left to live. Rahul turns his back on chemotherapy, leaves his fiancée Nafisa (Sonal Sehgal) and checks into a hospice with a backpack containing wads of rupee notes and a poster of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The money and the Hollywood movie about the archaeologist Indiana Jones play a big part in Rahul’s transition from anger to accepting his condition. Whenever Rahul is stuck for a solution, he pulls out a few bundles or fantasises about going off on an adventure, just like Jones. Aashayein isn’t particularly deep, but did it have to be this silly? The movie is torn between understanding Rahul’s psychological journey and exploring the stories of the other terminally ill characters at the hospice. Among them is a throat cancer patient (Girish Karnad) and an AIDS patient (Farida Jalal). Although the patients appear too healthy to be on the threshold of death, the movie benefits from having actors of the stature of Karnad and Jalal. But neither of them is a contest for Padma (Anaitha Nair), Rahul’s foul-mouthed and irreverent neighbour  at the hospice, and the life of the movie. Padma is another of the strong-willed and independent-minded women characters Kukunoor often writes into his  movies. Nair’s beautifully judged performance has the unfortunate consequence of spotlighting Abraham’s discomfort with his role. The movie isn’t about Padma’s crush on Rahul or her desire to make love at least once before she dies. It’s about Rahul’s fixation with Indiana Jones and his banal realizations about the true meaning of faith and hope. Abraham conceals his hunkiness under oversized clothes and attempts to mask his natural good-natured charm with pain-induced grimaces. One of Abraham’s best roles is in No Smoking, in which he plays a chain-smoking businessman battling to kick the habit. Abraham sucks deeply on his cigarettes in Aashayein too and gets punished for it yet again. But this time, the results are not half as interesting - Nandini Ramnath]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Sushil Rajpal’s Antardwand was completed in 2007, and the movie won the National Award for Social Issues in 2008. However, Rajpal’s debut feature has struggled to find a distributor for three years. The reasons are not far to seek. Antardwand eschews glamour and, except for a misjudged climax, strives to be as realistic as possible. The women don’t wear lipstick, and most of the men have prominent pot-bellies. Flies buzz around the food, and even a prostitute who is hired to dance at a wedding has a face that looks as though it has been scrubbed every day with a pumice stone. Antardwand is about Raghubir (Raj Singh Chaudhary), who is awaiting the results of the Indian Administrative Service examination. However, he isn’t as stressed about his marks as he is about his girlfriend (Himanshi), who is pregnant. Raghubir travels to his small-town home in Bihar to break the news to his parents. There, he gets kidnapped by the henchmen of Mahendra Babu (Akhilendra Mishra), who wants to avenge a slight inflicted upon him by Raghubir’s father (Vinay Pathak). Raghubir is forced at gunpoint to marry Mahendra Babu’s daughter Janki (Swati Sen). Will Raghubir consummate the relationship and thereby legitimise the wedding ceremony or flee? Rajpal spends too much time trying to answer this question. The movie builds up slowly. We already know that the abduction and the wedding ceremony are going to take place, but Rajpal takes his time in reaching the really interesting part of the story, which is the aftermath. Raghubir’s disgust at being forced to marry a woman he doesn’t care for is understandable, as is Janki’s ambivalence towards her husband. But for the sake of making the plot more interesting, Rajpal could perhaps, have complicated the relationship between the couple. Instead, everything proceeds as expected. Rajpal even begins to lose interest in Raghubir’s character – how else do we explain the movie’s ending, which leaves you no wiser about Raghubir’s fate? Despite its weak storyline, Antardwand has several ticks in its favour – convincing characters, efficient performances, well-chosen locations and a firm sense of place. Rajpal scores the most in his portrayal of feudal Bihar, which he shows to be a place swarming with patriarchal men and suppressed women. The feeling that there is no escape hangs over every frame, which is why the film’s closing moments beggar belief - Nandini Ramnath]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Abhinav Kashyap wrote dialogue for Manorama Six Feet Under and 13B and assisted Mani Ratnam on Yuva, but his experience came to nought when he tried to hawk his debut screenplay. Dabangg, written in late 2006, is the story of a daredevil police officer in a small town in Uttar Pradesh who lives by his own rules. After unsuccessfully talking to several producers, Kashyap met actor Arbaaz Khan, who said he would produce the film – and get his brother Salman Khan to be the hero. “Arbaaz said to me, why do you want to make a small film with theatre actors?” said Kashyap. “He put some sense into me. I thought I’d start small and eventually make a big film. Now, right from the word go, I have a big film.”Dabangg, which means fearless, is an out-and-out populist cocktail of star power, action, humour, item numbers and aphoristic dialogue, said 36-year-old Kashyap. “I have set out to make an entertaining film with mainstream production values for the masses,” he said. Dabangg is not just about a cop named Chulbul Pandey, but it’s also about his relationships, he added. “He is an unputdownable cop,” Kashyap said. “He has his own set of ethics. He flouts the laws, but which successful man doesn’t? One of the worst things that happens to us is that we study moral science in school. That subject should be banned. Why should I accept somebody else’s value system?” The movie’s over-the-top action and tongue-in-cheek humour, which resembles recent Tamil cop dramas, is perfect for its leading man’s persona, said Kashyap. “Salman is loved by the masses, and people enjoy it when he’s making a fool of himself.” -  NR]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In his latest film, director Pradeep Sarkar leaves behind the warm and polished interiors of Parineeta and Laaga Chunari Mein Daag for the gritty streets of Tilakwadi in Girgaum. One Shot Nandu (Neil Nitin Mukesh) is a prizefighter who wins bouts with a single knockout punch even though he is always blindfolded. Pinky wants to get out of the neighbourhood to fulfil her dreams of being a dancer. But everything changes when Pinky loses her eyesight in an accident. The rest of the movie deals with how Nandu and his friends help Pinky convert her visual disability into her strength. Gopi Puthran’s screenplay is briefly appealing when it focuses on the fluffy romance. But it wanes when it tries to resolve Nandu’s central conflict: should he choose love a career in the boxing ring? The movie sparkles in the few scenes involving the child actor Ameya Pandya, who delivers his slang-laced lines with panache, and Namit Das, who is fast becoming Bollywood’s go-to guy to play the hero’s best friend. Sandra Guerra’s stunt-driven choreography sequences is exciting, but the same cannot be said for the portions centred on the reality show. Padukone, playing an unglamorous part, pulls off the blind act well, but she fails to deliver in the dramatic bits. Mukesh fits the role of a man who is physically tough but a softie at heart. However, there is little for him to do other than spit out blood and cast lovelorn glances at Padukone. Sarkar struggles to tie together the pieces of his threadbare story. Lafangey Parindey is watchable but ultimately forgettable - Suhani Singh]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It takes just an enticing pair of Nike sneakers to lead NYU freshman Moose (Adam Sevani) down the rabbit hole into a musical wonderland. Without warning, this economics-major-cum-street-dancer is showing up a mean-looking mover from the House of Samurai and endearing himself to Luke (Rick Malambri), leader of a rival, more inclusive hoofer crew called the Pirates. The plot’s an old one – train like crazy, win the championship, get the girl – but then again, we don’t go to Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers productions for their revolutionary narrative contortions. Yes, I’ve invoked the holy duo in describing the third entry of a Disney-sanctioned franchise, and not just because Moose and his bestest (should-be-girl)friend, Camille (Alyson Stoner), pay glorious homage to them in a single-shot strut down a Manhattan side street. This is jump-’n’-jive cinema done right, populated by actual, likable dancers instead of Hollywood celebrities trying too hard…and with cinematography to match. It’s possible that the use of 3-D cameras forced director Jon Chu to compose his frames more rigorously: Head-to-toe coverage is favoured over piecemeal body shots, and the added dimension gives the New York locations the enveloping feel of old-time stereoscopic prints. The movie is a contemporary musical that makes you feel sky-high - Keith Uhlich]]></review>

But his malicious genius is barely in demand, thanks to hot young turk Vector (voice of Jason Segel), who’s stolen the Great Pyramid of Giza and hidden it in his backyard. Vector also has a shrink ray that Gru needs to pinch so he can get a scheme-funding loan from the Bank of Evil. What better way to make his nemesis lower his guard than with a doe-eyed trio of cookie-selling orphans? Despicable Me is at its best when trading in the anything-for-a-laugh prankery.

      <review><![CDATA[A pleasant surprise, Going the Distance is the first romantic comedy that seems expressly geared for the current US recession. The trailer makes this long-distance movie look like a collection of goofy gags – including tanning-salon accidents and bad phone sex– but what little slapstick there is feels like a commercial concession. Instead, the film paints a surprisingly serious portrait of two people – incoming Stanford journalism student Erin (Drew Barrymore), dissatisfied NYC record promoter Garrett (Justin Long ) – working in struggling industries. Just before Erin leaves New York, the two fall for each other, and they proceed 
from the wide-eyed notion that their cross-coastal relationship might work.
What gives Going the Distance an edge is the suspense over whether their love really can conquer career and ambition, as well as the acknowledgment that it might not. The expense of flights is discussed, resentments simmer. The dynamic between the leads actually feels less artificial than anything in Burstein’s documentary American Teen (2007), which proceeded from the presumption that real life is exactly like The Breakfast Club.
If all of this makes Going the Distance potentially notable, none of it would make it entertaining if the movie weren’t funny. It is, mostly thanks to terrific supporting work from Charlie Day as Garrett’s oversharing roommate and especially Christina Applegate, hilariously underplaying as Erin’s OCD sister. The two leads have great chemistry (as one might suspect from a reported on-again, off-again couple), but part of what’s refreshing about the film is that their chemistry is beside the point.

      <review><![CDATA[We’re supposed to watch the unsmiling, silver-haired George Clooney – particularly his hands – as he assembles a mean-looking silencer and nod at the movie’s understatement: ah, yes, the empty, methodical life of the hired assassin. The American, gorgeously shot in rural Italy, takes itself very seriously, even though the story is filled with the same Bond-acious vixens and prostitutes with hearts of gold as any clichéd spy film. Yet the film’s mood is so sombre and minimal, it might be confused for deep. Had the plot (meager and one-last-job-predictable) zipped along, that wouldn’t feel like such a problem.
But director Anton Corbijn is not a zipper-alonger. He lingers over quiet interiors: bars where simple cups of espresso are sipped by inscrutable men in blazers. At one point, a Sergio Leone spaghetti Western is playing on a widescreen TV, just to italicise the existential showdown we’re in for. Corbijn, once an important video director, was responsible for the equally portentous Control (2007), a visually stunning evocation of the somewhat uneventful life of Joy Division’s Ian Curtis. Clooney’s character, sometimes called Jack or Edward, has tonnes more to do than Curtis ever did, but he’s equally a figment of romanticised nothingness. When Hollywood summer films start flattering themselves, it’s time for a change of season. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[While trying to get pregnant, a happily married woman living in New York (Julia Roberts) realises that her life needs to go in a different direction and embarks on an around-the-world jaunt. No one is going into the breezy movie version of American writer Elizabeth Gilbert’s globe-trotting empowerment memoir expecting it to be Siddhartha. This is expertly wrought pop-psychology; perfect plates of pasta will be consumed in Rome (to nourish a wounded heart), then the soul will be tended in an Indian ashram, and finally romance will flourish in sultry Bali. Compared to a lot of cinema’s lunk-headed fantasies, is that really so offensive?
So, like a bad nutritionist, I’m less concerned with what goes into Ryan Murphy’s Eat Pray Love than what comes out of it. First and foremost is Julia Roberts, who, even though she never seems to gain weight, flatters Gilbert’s divorcée with a complex performance. Roberts has a star’s presence, which she underplays, curling into balls of insecurity and lifting her wine glass in tear-rimmed ruefulness. 
Even if you know where this story is going, it’s rare when Hollywood indulges such a robust woman’s picture, neither a glossy Sex and the City 2 nor a cryptic, indie Winter’s Bone. Rather, here is a vehicle that could have been driven by Faye Dunaway or Gena Rowlands.
The performances are knockouts, especially Richard Jenkins as a damaged Texas spiritualist who steeps the movie in intimacy. Oh, to have Julia’s choices: crushed ex-husband Billy Crudup, cute yogi James Franco, the Bali-dwelling Javier Bardem. The movie is aware of its own riches; it fills up your plate and dares you not to eat. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Shruti’s mother has had a haircut, but she has lost more than her tresses. Shruti (Zoya S Hassan) believes that the woman who claims to be her mom, Priya (Sarita Choudhary), is actually an alien who wants to destroy her daughter, son and husband. Thus begins For Real, Sona Jain’s sensitively directed debut feature. The film is about how a little girl’s hyperactive imagination gets the better of her, but it is also about a family that is slowly coming apart at the seams. Priya and her husband Ravi (Adil Hussain) are drifting away from each other, and Shruti is struggling to make sense of their emotional distance. 
The characters are well observed, and little Zoya is a knee-high knockout. However, there are several awkward passages as Sona Jain struggles to convey the complexity of the situation. She doesn’t always succedd, but the movie is lifted by its assured performances. Nandini Ramnath]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Oliver Stone is back on the trading floor and Michael Douglas is back in the sharp suits for Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, an undisciplined attempt by the director of JFK and W at resurrecting his 1980s tale for modern times and combining melodrama with up-to-the-minute social and economic commentary. Jacob (Shia LaBeouf) is a smart young trader at a Wall Street bank, where he enjoys the mentorship of a banking boss of the old school (Frank Langella) and is on the verge of ploughing money into an eco-business he’s identified as a safe investment. But the good vibes can’t last. There’s a crash and an aggressive takeover by rival banking boss Bretton James (Josh Brolin) sends his mentor tumbling onto the subway tracks and Jacob into Bretton’s hands. The other hitch is that Jacob’s girlfriend is Winnie Gekko (Carey Mulligan), daughter of Gordon (Michael Douglas), who’s on his way out of jail and not necessarily the reformed character he might appear. LaBeouf is fine as the film’s calm conscience and Douglas, too, is an amusing presence, not too broad and obviously enjoying himself. The cameos lighten the mood even more: Charlie Sheen pops up as Bud Fox from the first film; Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter plays himself in an especially odd scene; and Stone himself twice rears his head disastrously. Mulligan comes out of the whole thing poorly: her character is a bit of a sourpuss. Dave Calhoun]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Akash (Ranbir Kapoor) and Kiara (Priyanka Chopra) both want to kill themselves. He is in debt. Her boyfriend Kunaal (Zayed Khan) has cheated on her. Both have lost hope. They decide to live a little longer, fulfil their last wishes and meet on December 31 to die together in style. Akash falls for Kiara, but she continues to think that she is love with Kunal. Oh, to be young, fit and beautiful and get exercised about such frivolities. Sidharth Anand’s Anjaani Anjaani treats suicide and people who want to kill themselves as one big joke. The movie could have been a black comedy, but the writing simply isn’t sharp enough. There is no character development worth its name. Of the two, Kiara is surely severely depressed – she is something of a serial suicide attempter. In the film, though, she is always superbly turned out, has loads of friends, and a river-facing apartment in Manhattan. The message: however suicidal women get, they never ever stop following the latest fashion trends - Nandini Ramnath]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Khichdi, based on the popular TV sitcom of the same name, celebrates the doltish and idiosyncratic ways of the Parekh family. The Gujarati clan is doing what it does best: driving people insane with silly questions and inane answers. The characters include the patriarch Tulsidas (Anang Desai) – the only sane person of the dysfunctional lot – the daft couple Hansa (Supriya Pathak) and Praful (Rajeev Mehta), Hansa’s equally stupid brother Himanshu (Jamnadas Majethia) and the assertive daughter-in-law Jayshree (Nimisha Vakharia). The excuse for the big-screen reunion is that Himanshu is desperate to marry, but has to overcome a series of obstacles before he can do that. Much of the humour is derived by mangling the English language. The trademark phrases and gestures of Hansa, Praful and Himanshu are all there – and they are repeated incessantly. You’ll relish Khichdi for some time, but it loses its flavour halfway through - Suhani Singh]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[From its opening montage of Hallmark-worthy kisses to a climactic clinch under the Tuscan sun, Letters to Juliet celebrates synthetic sentiment. Less concerned with exploring or exemplifying romance than with fetishising it, the movie’s an extended ditty on behalf of hollow notions: If you believe in destiny or true love, clap your hands. While holidaying in Verona with her fiancé, Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal), aspiring writer Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) discovers a hideaway where women answer lovesick letters addressed to Shakespeare’s Juliet Capulet. She joins in, replying to an unearthed, 50-year-old missive written by an English girl, and thus inspiring widow Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) to visit Verona in search of her lost love. Victor is almost a parody of the Bernal type: a hyperactive, sensualist chef, foreordaining Sophie’s gravitation toward Claire’s blond, bland grandson. It’s a fantasy that prizes availability over ambition and British urbanity over Latin passion. Equipped with a curvy figure and Goldie Hawn’s vast trapezoidal grin, Seyfried is a marvel to look at but has little to do aside from keeping her anime eyes watered and soulful. Nonetheless, Redgrave classes up the joint: With one passing blush, one knowing smile, she turns pat sentimentality into something genuinely moving, and nearly makes the malarkey ring true.

      <review><![CDATA[I’m the guy who does his job,” goes Mark Wahlberg’s oft-quoted insult from 2006’s The Departed. “You must be the other guy!” So it’s a nice twist of cinematic fate that, in Adam McKay’s gonzo goof on buddy-cop flicks, the actor finds himself on the flip side of that bon mot. His hot-tempered New York City officer, Terry Hoitz, has been busted down to desk duty after an embarrassing incident involving a discharged weapon and a New York Yankee; Terry’s partner, Allen (Will Ferrell), is a dweeby forensic accountant who got bumped up to the bull pen. These sad sacks live in the shadow of two macho supercops –kudos, Samuel L Jackson and Dwayne Johnson! – renowned for their sexy, property-damaging style of law enforcement. Fate hands Terry and Allen a break; the film, meanwhile, gives Wahlberg and Ferrell beautiful opportunities to turn their anger-mismanagement-meets-milquetoast act into an absurdist version of Abbott and Costello. Forget the film’s limp attempts to send up Lethal Weapon movies while still delivering boom-boom-bang-bang thrills; you can also ignore the gossamer excuse for a plot involving a financial bigwig (a wasted Steve Coogan). Like McKay and Ferrell’s other collaborations (Anchorman, Talladega Nights), this comedy works best as an excuse for their bizarro humour: hobo sex in a Prius, metaphors about tuna attacking lions. Whenever Wahlberg and Ferrell have to do anything other than trash-talk or infuriate each other, The Other Guys shoots blanks. Give these two wits some choice non sequiturs about pimping, Jersey Boys and highly elaborate sex play, however, and you’ve got the makings for a new smart-stupid franchise. David Fear]]></review>

The Telugu Desam Party legislator from Rayalseema district in southern Andhra Pradesh was shot dead in broad daylight in Anantpur on January 24, 2005.

      <review><![CDATA[Two things are clear about Indian animated movies: most are based on mythological stories, and none of them has managed to tempt Indian viewers away from Hollywood extravaganzas. Ketan Mehta’s Maya Digital Media wants to prove otherwise. Ramayana – The Epic, a 3-D computer-animated movie, follows the life of Ram from his birth through his marriage to Sita to his banishment from Ayodhya and his battle with Raavan. The voice cast includes Manoj Bajpai, Juhi Chawla and Ashutosh Rana. Director Chetan Desai, who is also the creative head of Maya, said that a team of 400 artists spent “3.5 million man hours” over two-and-a-half-years to complete the film.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Shankar’s giga-budget spectacle Robot is high-tech timepass of the highest order. The movie, which is a dubbed version of the Tamil Enthiran, offers imaginative special effects and technical wizardry designed to gobsmack audiences into complete submission. It works most of the time, so much so when Shankar deploys the standard elements of populist cinema, such as songs and a comedy track, the film sags noticeably. Vasigaran (Rajinikant) creates a robot in his own likeness. He names the robot Chitti, and watches in pride as the machine excels at every task, including whipping up omelettes and helping Vasigaran’s girlfriend Sana (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) cheat in her medical college exams. However, Chitti can’t understand the difference between good and evil, so Vasigaran loads some more software into him and humanises him to the extent that the robot covets Sana. Vasigaran’s mentor, crooked scientist Bora (Danny Denzongpa), steps in to take advantage of the situation. Robot is a vaguely cautionary tale about tinkering with technology, but Shankar is more interested in creating a character who can move to his commands and who can execute astonishing computer-generated feats. Although the computer-generated mayhem is derivative of American blockbusters like The Terminator and Transformers, a nice scene in the early part of the movie showcases Shankar’s ability to give Indian touches to a quintessentially Hollywood genre. Sana is being pursued by a bunch of rowdies bearing sickles and knives. Chitti turns on a magnetic field and sucks all the weapons towards him, which then cling to his back in the shape of a circle, making him look like a many-armed goddess. Nandini Ramnath]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Sporting a neat crew cut, a sweat-glazed six-pack and a nice line in Boston-emblazoned tracksuit tops, Ben Affleck is Doug, the conflicted leader of a rubber-masked wrecking crew who take down banks on behalf of kingpin (and florist!) Pete Postlethwaite. Doug wants to take his loot and make a break for Florida, a desire fuelled by his relationship with Rebecca Hall’s kindly soup-kitchen mama. But Pete’s got dirt on him, and even though the Feds are closing in (led by John Hamm), the team keep breaking banks, leading to a minutely orchestrated take-down of the Boston Red Sox’s home ground. You’d hazard from this and his previous directorial effort, Gone Baby Gone, that Affleck counts Michael Mann and Sidney Lumet among his muses. You’d also guess from the film’s slickly calculated pacing and surfeit of soulful heart-to-hearts that break up the carnage that he has a fondness for the TV work of David Simon, notably Homicide: Life on the Street and The Wire. Yet despite the grubby locations in the Bostonian crime-hub of Charlestown, the film’s credibility feels severely hamstrung by the fact that even though the robbers (especially Jeremy Renner as a gung-ho ex-con) are armed and dangerous, too much effort is made to ensure us that it’s never nice-guy Affleck who’s pulling the trigger - David Jenkins]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA["Alexandre Aja says his 3D re-working of Joe Dante’s 1978 original is an attempt to recreate the guilty pleasure movies of his youth. So here, in the best/worst traditions of 1970s Hollywood exploitation cinema, are flesh-eating fishy gore, lip-smacking nudity and lots of laugh-out-loud silliness. If you’re looking for the anti-establishment message found in the original Roger Corman-produced Jaws rip-off, you will be disappointed. However, the re-make’s cheesy, eye-popping 3D effects – flayed bodies, vomit and a severed penis are all flung out of the screen – are an authentic, affectionate throwback to cheapo Cormanesque excess.When an underground earthquake releases shoals of prehistoric piranha into Lake Victoria, local sheriff Julie Forester (Elisabeth Shue) tries in vain to persuade several thousand Spring Break revellers to quit their aquatic hedonism before they become fish food. Meanwhile, her son Jake (Steven R McQueen) has been lured onto a pleasure boat by slimeball porn director Derrick (Jerry O’Connell) and busty, bikini-clad Danni (Kelly Brook). Also aboard is nice girl Kelly (Jessica Szohr), on whom Jake has a crush, who ends up licking tequila, salt and lime off the body and lips of Danni’s co-star Crystal (real-life porn star Riley Steele). But once the fishy feeding frenzy starts, it’s human flesh that’s on the menu. Aja serves up the tongue-in-cheek thrills and CGI-enhanced gore with unabashed relish. There are also nice cameos from Richard Dreyfuss, reprising his Jaws role, and Hostel director Eli Roth, who completely loses his head after hosting a wet T-shirt contest. Nigel Floyd]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[After Lady in the Water, The Happening and especially The Last Airbender, one would have thought any sane production company would want to keep M Night Shyamalan’s name as far away as possible from their new product. And yet here comes Devil, the first instalment in the worryingly titled “Night Chronicles”, a series of standalone projects conceived – if not actually written and directed – by the one-time golden boy of mainstream Hollywood horror.The setup is simple: it’s the wrath of Satan… in a lift. Five strangers get stuck in an elevator between the twentieth and twenty-first floors of a  Philadelphia office block. When they start dying off, the ultra-religious lift operator knows what’s going on: each of the five has a dark secret, and now Beelzebub has come to claim their souls.Despite his staunchly Catholic education, Shyamalan has managed to keep his own movies largely free of religious dogma, Mel Gibson’s crisis of faith in Signs notwithstanding. But Devil’s subject matter leaves no such room for obfuscation: this is an aggressively, conservative movie, loaded with damnation and redemption and snarkily dismissive of short-sighted non-believers. It’s not a bad film, as such, just a silly, unconvincing one: entertaining enough in its way, but crude and quickly forgotten. Tom Huddleston]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Every studio exec in Hollywood has spent the last five years or so scouring the children’s literature catalog for the next Harry Potter. Along the way, some good fantasy books have been turned into muddled movies (The Golden Compass, The Chronicles of Narnia, Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians). Kathryn Lasky’s Guardians of Ga’Hoole books, about the heroic adventures of owls who battle wearing armour, is an obvious candidate for adaptation. A young hero is separated from his family, experiences some bad things, undertakes an epic journey and learns important life lessons. It writes itself. The fact that the heroes are, you know, owls, with sorely limited facial expressions…well, that’s just an interesting challenge for the digital animators.Snyder tackles the movie with the same plodding bombast he delivered in 300. He’s also overly fond of the swooping mobile camera (technically, the simulation of a moving camera in the computer, of course), which certainly gives owl flight a vertiginous feeling, but also makes the film feel like a boat ride on a rather stormy night. The plot moves along in a fashion that will probably satisfy the pre-teen target audience, but it’s a bit of a grind for anyone who knows their way around the fantasy tropes. Hank Sartin]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The biggest achievement of Abbas Tyrewala’s sophomore effort is that it shows that the hunky John Abraham can be convincing as a character who starts stammering when he’s in the company of pretty women. What is harder to believe is how he ends up with the bland Mishka (Pakhi), the movie’s writer and Tyrewala’s wife in real life.Abraham is Siddharth, part-owner of a bookshop in London specialising in titles of Indian philosophy. A nice touch is that the poster stuck outside the bookstore declares, “We don’t do Deepak Chopra”. When Siddharth’s phone number is included in an ad for a suicide helpline for Indians living in London, he decides to volunteer with the organsiation. He takes his generosity a notch higher when he turns shrink and mentor to Mishka, a vulnerable, jilted woman with a host of personal issues. A game of lies and misunderstandings begins when Siddharth meets Mishka and falls for her, but doesn’t reveal that he is the person on the other side of the phone who knows all her secrets. Pakhi creates several tender and funny moments between Siddharth and his gang of friends, especially Omar (Raghu Ram), who has the film’s best lines. But the plot is stretched beyond tolerable limits, and AR Rahman’s songs only slacken the pace.
Jhootha Hi Sahi is as fluffy and sugar-coated as Tyrewala’s Jaane Tu… Ya Jaane Na. While Jaane Tu had great cameos from experienced actors like Naseeruddin Shah and Ratna Pathak Shah, Jhootha Hi Sahi has Abraham in a glamour-free role that could expand his fan base, but won’t prove that he has improved his acting skills just yet.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The latest product to roll off the Priyadarshan assembly line is an unacknowledged copy of Alan Parker’s Mississippi Burning. Parker’s film was about the Ku Klux Klan in the American South; the battle in Aakrosh is between Brahmins and Dalits. A burning trishul replaces the fiery 
crosses in Mississippi Burning –  Priyadarshan’s big contribution to the story is to throw in an item song. 
Two government agents, Pratap (Ajay Devgn) and Sidhant (Akshaye Khanna), arrive in the town of Jhanjhar to investigate the disappearance of three young men from Delhi. One of the men is a Dalit who had the temerity to fall in love with the daughter of Jhanjhar’s local heavy (Atul Tiwari), who is also the leading light of a Ranvir Sena-type private army called the Shool Sena. The presence of the government officials causes caste tensions to burst into the open, and several Dalits become cannon fodder during the pursuit of truth and justice. 
If the story commands any interest at all, it’s because of the movie it is copied from. Priyadarshan isn’t content with filching from Mississippi Burning – he even takes scenes from The Bourne Supremacy and Mirch Masala. Two factors work in the movie’s favour: the evocative locations, and the sincerity of the two leading men. Nandini Ramnath]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The first two parts of what has now become the Golmaal franchise always managed to tickle the funny bone. Merrily bereft of logic and even a coherent plot, Rohit Shetty’s films rely on smart gags and spot-on performances. The third movie, a vast improvement over the second, is a humour-laden ensemble effort that ultimately fails only because it doesn’t want to end. Several of the franchise’s good-for-nothing characters return. This time around, the temperamental Gopal (Ajay Devgn) and the outspoken Madhav (Arshad Warsi) are bitter business rivals. On Gopal’s side is Laxman (Shreyas Talpade), his stammering brother, and Daboo (Kareena Kapoor), his friend with a penchant for hurling inventive abuses. Meanwhile, Madhav is backed by his brothers, the speech-impaired Lucky (Tusshar Kapoor) and Laxman (Kunal Khemu), who makes inappropriate and nonsensical quotations. The war between the two groups heightens when Gopal’s mother Gita (Ratna Pathak Shah) and Madhav’s father Pritam (Mithun Chakraborty), lovers who were separated in their youth, get married. Living under one roof equals more slapstick humour. The real star of Golmaal 3 is the dialogue writing duo of Farhad-Sajid, who dole out one hilarious one-liner after the other. Almost every character is given a quirk that is squeezed to the maximum. But there are also moments of dullness, especially when Shetty gets distracted by car crashes and bodies flying through the air in slow motion. Ultimately, however, the strengths of this family entertainer outnumber its weaknesses. Suhani Singh]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Director David Fincher (Seven, Zodiac) and writer Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing, A Few Good Men) have made a mischievous, scaremongering tale about the origins of Facebook that combines the talky rigour of Sorkin’s writing with the spooky crispness of Fincher’s imagery. The movie launches us headfirst into an intense exchange between two students, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and his girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara), sitting in a Harvard bar, opposite each other, nursing beers. You can hardly call it a conversation. She speaks normally; he avoids eye-contact, talks through her, responds selectively and, when the chat doesn’t go his way, asks, “Is this real?” It’s a brilliant scene: on its own because it says so much about the filmmakers’ spin on Facebook founder Zuckerberg and the limits of interaction that his invention seeks to plaster over, and in the context of the work as a whole because it tells us that this is a film about a creeping void between people, whether or not they’re lovers, enemies, business partners or Facebook friends. The film makes its case instantly that Zuckerberg is a social disaster and sticks to that line as it moves from the wood-pannelled college dorms and snowy cloisters of Massachusetts to the trendy bars and hip offices of Palo Alto, California. We meet Zuckerberg as he develops various student sites until he hits on TheFacebook.com, which he runs with friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), who is more suave, less awkward and the bridge between Zuckerberg and Harvard’s exclusive student clubs – a world from which he feels bitterly excluded. As Facebook grows, Zuckerberg moves to California, seduced by the real-world, nerd made-good charms of Napster’s founder, Sean Parker (singer Justin Timberlake), who offers Zuckerberg informal membership of another club, a world of investors by day and parties by night. Eisenberg gives a storming performance as Zuckerberg, complementing his geeky clothes (hoodies, flip-flops) with a perma-deadpan voice, wildly roving eyes and a jolty physical presence. He is full of contradictions: socially awkward but confident; ignorant of commerce but ruthless in business. Essentially, the film is a series of flashbacks built around more recent legal shenanigans: the two depositions that resulted from accusations that, firstly, Saverin was unfairly ousted from Facebook and, secondly, that Zuckerberg stole his idea from two Harvard contemporaries, the Vinklevoss twins (Armie Hammer plays both). These meetings, and Zuckerberg’s un-cooperative presence at them, give the film a sober framework, but otherwise it’s a chronological tale, fast, furious and funny. There’s no escaping that The Social Network sticks the knife into Zuckerberg and milks the irony of a disconnected soul connecting the world. This is Fincher and Sorkin’s spin on the truth, grounded in fact but stretched and moulded to suit their themes. But what makes the film more than a witty, well-performed hatchet job that’s plugged cynically into the technological zeitgeist is that, despite the fun of the parties, the intrigue of the legal wranglings and the humour of the dialogue, Fincher and Sorkin never let us forget that we’re complicit in their story (or at least 500 million of us are). If, as the film argues, Zuckerberg’s values are mirrored in Facebook, what does that say about us? Dave Calhoun]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In his second lovable fool role of the year after Housefull, Akshay Kumar plays a bucktoothed, bespectacled buffoon who is an object of ridicule all around. Kumar’s earnestness and foolishness prove to be one of the few highlights of Vipul Shah’s otherwise tepid movie. Bunty (Aditya Roy Kapur) is vehemently against marriage, a belief that emerges from the rocky state of his parents’ union. His father Kishen (Akshay Kumar), a white-haired, haggard restaurateur, and mother Mala (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan), a stylish hausfrau who blows up her husband’s hard-earned money. After watching his parents fight on their thirty-fifth wedding anniversary, Bunty uses a time machine built by his girlfriend’s grandfather (Randhir Kapoor) to travel to 1975 and modify the past so that the present can be perfect (à la Back to the Future). He becomes the mastermind of Kishen’s makeover, and the matchmaker between the beauty and the geek. Adapted from the popular Gujarati play, which was also directed by Shah, the screen version is sketchy on logic and low on detail. Shah’s regular writing collaborators, Aatish Kapadia and Suresh Nair, add nothing new to the bag of tricks used by countless romantic comedies. Nitin Desai’s production design is kitschy and often jarring – every day seems to be Diwali, given the number of lanterns, earthen lamps and fairy lights in almost every frame. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan fits the role of the soft-hearted bully, but the script is far kinder to Kumar, whose comic timing saves the day. Suhani Singh]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The very first appearance of Native Americans in the movies can be credited to Thomas Edison, who used real-life footage of Laguna Pueblo Indians for his publicly exhibited kinetoscopes; in other words, they have been a presence in moving pictures from the very beginning. To say that their screen personae have changed frequently since then would be an understatement, though the most contentious cinematic version of the “Indian” monosyllabic, stone-faced, primitive and perversely vicious – has had a stranglehold on the popular imagination for decades. Native American documentarian Neil Diamond (not the pop singer) was curious as to how films have shaped the racial identity of America’s indigenous people, so he hit the road, travelling from northeastern Canada to Hollywood. Occasionally, his rambling journal of self-discovery detours into incisive testimonies from Native American actors, moviemakers, critics and activists, complemented by clips ranging from classic Western scenes to Sacheen Littlefeather’s refusal of Marlon Brando’s Godfather Oscar. Had Diamond stuck to the straightforward doc route, Reel Injun could have been the definitive statement on the subject; indeed, both the talking-head interviews and montages trace distortions and puncture myths with rigour. (Iron Eyes Cody? He was actually Sicilian.) The first-person sections, however, couldn’t be more clumsy or grating. David Fear]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Bela Negi’s debut film Daayen Ya Baayen is set in a remote village perched on a hill in Uttarakhand. The movie uses its rural backdrop as more than just an excuse to line up quirky characters and unseen locations. The film is a smart and perceptive look at small-town aspirations and the true meaning of progress. The movie’s overly busy plot is about Ramesh, a scriptwriter who returns from Mumbai to Kanda village to teach at the local school, ostensibly because he wants to reform his lazy and uncultured neighbours. The truth is that Ramesh has dropped out of the rat race in the city and is looking for a place back home to hide. With his put-on ways and his penchant for poetry, he doesn’t go unnoticed in Kanda – especially not after he wins a red sedan in a contest. The red car soon becomes a white elephant for Ramesh. Kanda treats his windfall with a combination of scorn and envy, leading to all kinds of comic situations. The story opens out to capture the hopes, desires and realities of Kanda’s villagers – and, by extension, all of Uttarakhand, which hasn’t lived up to its promise after it was carved out of Uttar Pradesh as a separate state in 2000. Much of the film’s good-natured humour comes from the fact that Kanda’s residents are going nowhere fast. Manav Kaul’s character, who spends all day playing cards, tanking up on cheap alcohol and romancing local girls from the perch of his bicycle, symbolises Kanda’s overall lassitude.

At first they hate each other, but after a long series of misunderstandings and misadventures the two reach a grudging acceptance, even affection. Yep, you’ve gotta love Planes, Trains and Automobiles. To be fair, The Hangover director Todd Phillips goes out of his way to distance himself from John Hughes’s well-liked holiday romp, largely by making Due Date a lot louder, ruder and more violent. But it doesn’t work: every time we look at Robert Downey Jr’s highly-strung Peter, we remember how good Steve Martin was in a near-identical role. And every time we meet Zach Galafianakis’s masturbating slob Ethan, we recall how John Candy managed to be both infuriating and sympathetic without resorting to crude grossout. Phillips also tries to distinguish his film by littering it with cameos, some of which work – Danny McBride as an enraged ex-soldier, RZA as a stony-faced customs official – but most of which feel underdeveloped: Juliette Lewis plays second fiddle to Galafianakis in a scene as a white-trash pot dealer, and Jamie Foxx, as Downey’s best friend, walks out of the room midway through a scene and, inexplicably, never returns. There are some decent laughs scattered throughout Due Date, but  Phillips can’t find a way to make his two leads likeable: they remain obnoxious and ill- suited right to the schmaltzy finale.

      <review><![CDATA[Danish Aslam’s debut is far more engaging and convincing than other recent rom-coms antic such as I Hate Luv Storys and Aisha. At the centre of the screenplay by Aslam and Renuka Kunzru are a likeable young couple and dialogues that are witty and conversational. Aaliyah (Deepika Padukone) is a free-spirited, vivacious girl raised by a single parent (Sharmila Tagore). Her best friend and boyfriend is Abhay (Imran Khan), a large-hearted slacker. Despite the differences in their personalities and their squabbles, they seem happy together. However, their decade-long relationship faces its first real test when Aaliyah goes to Australia to study. Aaliyah calls the now long-distance relationship off. But Abhay won’t give up. He lands up in Australia and stays in the same house as her.It is here that Break Ke Baad begins to unravel. She gives her clingy ex-boyfriend the cold shoulder treatment, while he plays the waiting game and becomes a chef. Break Ke Baad initially works because the characters are never shy of expressing their feelings. There is a comfort between Padukone and Khan – Padukone especially deftly shuffles between drama and humour and makes a flawed character appealing. However, too many contrived situations and a slackening of pace squander a promising first half - Suhani Singh]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Guzaarish isn’t as bathetic as Black or soporific as Saawariya , but it isn’t exactly an improvement on both films either.  The movie’s problems stem entirely from its facile treatment of the subject at hand – euthanasia – and the barely real world that Ethan wants to be liberated from forever. The story generously borrows from Alejandro Amenebar’s Spanish film The Sea Inside. Ethan is a magician who becomes a quadriplegic after an accident. After 12 years of surviving his condition, he believes he has had enough and files a mercy killing petition in court. Euthanasia is an ethical minefield, which The Sea Inside explored with some depth and gravity, but in Guzaarish, it is little more than an excuse to wring out tears for a suffering hero. To shift focus from the tricky issue of mercy killing, Bhansali introduces Omar (Aditya Roy Kapur), a young magician who wants to be tutored by Ethan. However, Ethan’s relationship with Omar doesn’t build up to anything substantial. The movie’s best scenes are between Ethan and his nurse Sophia (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan). Roshan and Rai Bachchan can always be counted on to rustle up crackling chemistry for the screen - Nandini Ramnath]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Anyone who complained that the previous episode in the Harry Potter saga felt too much like scene-setting for the final showdown will be equally disappointed with Deathly Hallows Part 1. A film with no beginning and no end but a whole lot of expository middle, this is the least satisfying instalment in the series since Chris Columbus folded up his director’s chair. Bill Nighy’s Minister of Magic sets the tone with a barbed speech bemoaning the state of the magical nation: murders, disappearances and raids are becoming commonplace and no one, it seems, is safe. Least of all our bespectacled hero (Daniel Radcliffe), who bids farewell to the suburbia of his youth before being whisked away in the film’s only outright action sequence, a dizzying high-speed flying-bike chase through a tunnel. The ensuing half hour is business as usual: an entertaining balance of sorcery, slapstick and sweetness, enlivened by a handful of scary scenes and a surprisingly sadistic streak of black humour. But once the kids decide to break out on their own, setting off across the English countryside on the trail of the four remaining shards of the Dark Lord Voldemort’s soul, things take a bleaker turn, and they never quite recover. Part of the problem is JK Rowling’s source material: there are too many characters and too many magical Mcguffins to keep track of. The episodic plot wanders as aimlessly as the children, culminating in the death of a character we’ve barely been introduced to. The producers’ decision to cut the final movie in two feels like a mistake. Deathly Hallows Part 1 feels like the weaker half of a still-promising film - Tom Huddleston]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The law of diminishing returns catches up with Ram Gopal Varma’s Rakht Charitra 2, the sequel in the vendetta saga whose first part opened in September. Both the films represent a remarkable documentary-style recreation of blood feuds that kept Andhra Pradesh’s Rayalseema region on the boil for much of the 1990s and the 2000s. Perhaps only Varma, who has a longstanding interest in the intersection of crime and politics, could have thought of bringing Rayalseema’s horror years to the screen. All the slo-mo gratuitous gore and stylised posturing of the characters can’t disguise the fact that in a corner of Andhra Pradesh, life has been stranger than fiction. The deranged violence in part one gives way to introspection about the pursuit of revenge. The second episode also has a clearly identifiable hero, in case viewers felt that Varma was batting a bit too hard for Pratap Ravi (Vivek Oberoi), who avenges the deaths of his father and brother in a spectacularly violent fashion. Surya (Suriya), the son of the politician who conspired to have Ravi’s family members killed, emerges to repeat the cycle of violence started in the first movie. There’s also intelligence officer Mohan Prasad (Sudeep), who protects Ravi’s wife Bhavani (Priyamani) and infant son and persuades Surya to surrender, not realising that Surya will plot his revenge from behind bars. The violence often borders on the fantastic, but the movie is based on real events. Pratap is modelled on Paritala Ravi, a ruthless criminal and Telugu Desam Party member who conducted his violent affairs from under the protective cover of political patronage. Surya is based on Suryanarayana Reddy, the son of one of Ravi’s targets. Varma stays away from Paritala Ravi’s other unsavoury dealings, such as his involvement in land-grabbing and extortion. The movie is a contest between two men defined purely by anger and violence. Tamil star Suriya makes his debut in Hindi with Rakht Charitra 2. Suriya uses his expressive eyes and acting skills to superb effect, but the second part is not as effective as the first. The movie opens with a 20-minute prologue that repeats several scenes from the first, which initially causes great confusion. The killings that gave the first part its demented power now seem repetitive, although there are some spectacular action scenes. The political wheelings and deadlings that keep Pratap in power are barely explored. A network of forces – politicians, industrialists, police officers – allowed Paritala Ravi to get away with murder for years, which the movie could have sacrificed some its blood and gore to explore - Nandini Ramnath]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The few critics who view Tony Scott as a kind of postmodern wizard of time and space – there are defences of his Déjà Vu (2006) that compare it to Vertigo – get new evidence from Unstoppable, an exercise in pure action that’s awful in terms of character and dialogue, but very exciting in other regards. Its inspiration comes from a 2001 news blip about an unmanned train that barrelled through Ohio carrying combustible material; it was finally slowed down to ten miles an hour, boarded and halted. No such luck here. Now it’s racing into oncoming traffic toward the Stanton curve in Pennsylvania, unencumbered by the decisions of bureaucrats who would sooner risk destroying a city than see their stock devalued with a derailing What might on paper seem like a Speed rip-off is actually simpler and more streamlined: A train can’t manoeuvre as much as a bus, and our heroes have only so many switch-offs and miles of parallel road they can use to stop it - Ben Kenigsberg.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[By now, pretty much everyone is hip to the fact that superheroes are a snooze; supervillains are where the real action is, whether it’s Dr Horrible’s glorious, musical slide into true evil or Despicable Me’s less successful attempt at a tale of evil gone good. Megamind screenwriters Alan J Schoolcraft and Brent Simons clearly know that Will Ferrell is their strongest card, and they have shaped the script to allow for a lot of rapid-fire jokes perfectly suited to his particular style. I’ve grown pretty tired of this sort of zinger stuff of late, because so often it’s not done all that well, and the topical references are a lazy substitute for good plotting. But Megamind works remarkably well because the jokes about superheroes are above-average stuff, on par with The Incredibles, and the script has a well-structured plot, with some neat twists. Ferrell’s Megamind is an evil genius who clearly loves the endless battles with smug good guy Metro Man (voiced by Brad Pitt). But it’s only after Metro Man is out of the picture that Megamind realises he needs a good yin to his evil yang. He makes a nerdy television cameraman (voiced by Jonah Hill) into the hero Tighten (“It was the only name that wasn’t trademarked”), but things don’t go as planned. Tina Fey provides solid voice support as a tough reporter, and Cross does his usual off-the-wall stuff as Megamind’s right-hand-alien-fish. It should be noted that the film makes reasonably effective use of 3-D, but I’m betting that it would work perfectly well in 2-D, so feel free to economise. The real added dimensions here are in the script. Hank Sartin]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This is a remarkable film. Take the Oscar-winning director of the universally acclaimed The Lives of Others, and add not one, but two Oscar-winning screenwriters – Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park) and Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects). Throw in Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, attractive locations in wintry Paris and Venice. Sounds like it can hardly miss, right? Well, The Tourist is remarkable because its not inconsiderable talent pool has delivered a would-be light-hearted international crime caper that runs the gamut from idiocy to tedium and back again. Angelina Jolie is our glamorous female lead, inexplicably cast as the English other half to a fugitive embezzler, who’s being eagerly sought by British police for diddling the UK taxman and indeed a heavy-duty gangster (Steven Berkoff). This latter-day pimpernel manages to get a message to his beloved in Paris to board a train to Venice and befriend a stranger she can pass off as him to put the pursuers off the scent – enter tousle-haired fake-ciggie-puffing Johnny Depp as the world’s least likely suburban maths teacher. Before long, he’s sharing an exclusive hotel room with this enigmatic seductress, the prelude to being chased across the Venetian rooftops by Russian-accented thugs, and so forth. And in the midst of this, do we detect a frisson of romance….? Possibly, but that would necessitate emerging from a coma first. The movie’s clearly intended as an insouciant diversion, but Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s direction paces every single scene with the earnest deliberation of a learner articulated-lorry driver executing an especially tricky three-point turn. Some felicities of performance or dialogue might enliven the torpor, but there’s a dearth of snappy one-liners. Johnny Depp underplays to the degree you feel you must be watching the rehearsal takes, and Angelina Jolie puts so much concentration into maintaining her Julie Andrews accent that she’s obviously no energy to invest this mystery lady with any emotional life. There’s barely a flicker of chemistry between the two stars, which renders everything else increasingly academic, especially when the presumed action highlights fall flat. Paul Bettany’s struggles to do anything as the man from Scotland Yard. Yes, it’s dreck, but we’ve all seen duff movies. What makes this so exasperating is that The Tourist is so pleased with itself. It’s as if we’re supposed to be pitifully grateful just to see La Jolie in a slinky dress, or peek inside Venice’s swanky Hotel Danieli, or thrill to the devastatingly clever plot developments the filmmakers have in store for us.

      <plot><![CDATA[Travel writer Lemuel Gulliver takes an assignment in Bermuda, but ends up on the island of Liliput, where he towers over its tiny citizens.]]></plot>
      <review><![CDATA[Based on the 18th century novel of the same name, this update sees a slacker mailroom clerk being transported to the land of Lilliput (yes, this is the original name of the mythical land in the novel) after messing up a travel assignment to the Bermuda Triangle. There, the giant (or Beast, as he is affectionately known to the locals), he becomes a hero to the little people, fighting villains and matchmaking a peasant and a princess. When a battle with a petty general goes awry, the roly poly backs out and cowers in fear. Of course, you know this is only temporary - who would be in the mood for an un-happy ending during the festive season? The filmmakers have aptly cast Jack Black in the role of Gulliver, given his larger than life personality. This is clearly the comedian's show, seeing how the camera focuses on his every single exaggerated facial expression and body gesture. Black has impressed us with his comedic talents in movies like the surprise hit School of Rock (2003) and the hilarious satire Tropic Thunder (2008). And who can miss his adorable persona in Kung Fu Panda (2008)? In his latest work which he also plays the executive producer role, Black effortlessly pulls of the portrayal of a lovable loser who you cannot bear to dislike. He is joined by a capable cast including Amanda Peet (2012) who plays his love interest, Jason Segel (I Love You, Man) who plays a Lilliput resident, Emily Blunt (The Wolfman) who plays a Lilliput princess and Billy Connolly (The X Files: I Want to Believe) who plays a Lilliput king. As you have noticed by now, most of the actors play tiny people in this 88 minute movie. They all fare pretty well, but like all holiday movies, this isn't really what the audience is looking out for. What is in place is the usual numbed down and logic deprived script which will not bother the casual viewer. What's more, since this movie is targeted at the family crowds, there is no need to sophisticate things. Hence, the filmmakers have every reason to throw in mindless pop culture references, ranging from Star Wars' Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker to Titanic's Jack and Rose. Also, you get to see Gulliver inspired posters and billboards which are at most mildly amusing. Unfortunately, these litters of chuckles do not contribute much to the story. Director Rob Letterman (Monsters vs Aliens) have made use of green screen technology, and in a move that doesn't surprise anyone anymore, 3D technique to bring this tale to the big screen. We are pretty sure that when Jonathan Swift wrote the original novel in 1726, the satire was supposed to bring out certain traits of human nature. After countless adaptations, this message has become a diluted affair with nothing refreshing to offer except a couple of pointless chuckles.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey is about the Chittagong uprising of 1930, in which a schoolteacher and his comrades raided various British installations, including the armoury and the telegraph office. Several teenagers participated in the raid, which captured the nation’s imagination. Gowariker’s motivation in adapting Do and Die, journalist Manini Chatterjee’s book on the uprising, is to remind modern-day viewers of a time when young adults sacrificed their lives for a cause. However, the film is also ambivalent about the price paid for swapping schoolbooks for guns – counted in the number of young lives lost in the retaliation. The first half is Revolution 101. This is a revolver, Surjya Sen (Abhishek Bachchan) tells the teenagers. This is how you load the bullets. Gowariker recreates the planning for the big raid in all its detail. So what if it bores you to tears? Unlike most other movies that start with a bang and fade out with a whimper, KHJJS actually comes to life in the second half. The raid itself proves that Sen and his comrades were first-rate patriots but less accomplish-ed planners. As the British blow large holes in their plan, they go hither and thither. Many lives are lost – the most powerful scene involves the mowing down of some of the teenagers – before Sen is finally caught and put on trial. Like all of Gowariker’s over-long movies, the 160-minute KHJJS would have benefitted from tighter plotting and some ruthless editing. Several rousing speeches and “Vande Matarams” are flung about at periodic intervals. This could have been a movie about a bunch of daredevils who rushed fearlessly into danger. The movie captures some of the bravura courage of the revolutionaries, but not their unique madness. Nandini Ramnath]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The bad guys are actually the good guys in Subhash Kapoor’s timely satire Phas Gaye Re Obama, which is the second movie this year after Tere Bin Laden to take potshots at America and its presidents. Bade Saheb (Sanjay Mishra) heads a kidnapping business in Uttar Pradesh that has been badly hit by the worldwide economic downturn. One of his gang members, Anni (Manu Rishi), dreams of moving to the land of plenty, the United States of America. When non-resident Indian businessman Om Shastri (Rajat Kapoor) comes to India for a visit, Saheb thinks he has found the perfect meal ticket. The glitch is that Shastri’s own fortunes have nosedived because of the recession. Kapoor’s Hindie uses humour to demonstrate how the slump in the American economy has dragged almost everybody in the world down. The film also lampoons the Indian obsession with wealth. The ensemble comprises confident and convincing actors, especially Manu Rishi and Sanjay Mishra. Neha Dhupia playing a man-hating gangster and Amole Gupte a corrupt politician make most of their limited screen time. However, not all of Kapoor’s jokes score laughs. Also, the the movie could have been paced better - SS]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This sequel suffers from almost the same problems as the original: while it’s visually dazzling (particularly in 3D), thematically intriguing and fronted by the single coolest man in the universe, it’s also empty, derivative and rather directionless. We pick up the story a few years after the events of the first movie, as Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) waxes lyrical about the possibilities of this new technology to seven-year-old son Sam. But when Flynn goes mysteriously missing, control of his company passes to a board of faceless corporate drones. Sam, now a rebellious 27-year-old played by blandly handsome mediocrity Garrett Hedlund, decides to go digging into the past and soon finds himself zapped into the computer and thrust onto the infamous Game Grid. There’s a lot of story in Tron: Legacy: pretty much every character in the computer world, from Flynn’s digi-Hitler nemesis Clu (also played by a creepy, digitally youth-ified Bridges) to Michael Sheen as bizarre pantomime Bowie-alike club owner Zeus, has their personal history sketched out, usually in portentous flashback. But this can’t compensate for an absence of actual character development: even Sam, the supposed hero, is little more than a winning smile and a missing-Dad complex. Bridges makes the best of an underwritten part, but his amiable, dedicated character from the first movie has been reduced to a shaggy Zen master spouting sub-Lebowski hippy-isms (‘radical, man!’). There’s no doubting the film’s visual ambition: the first act is essentially one breathlessly impressive action sequence, making the best imaginable use of 3D technology to thrust the audience right into this gorgeous, intricately detailed fantasy world. Daft Punk’s pulsating Moroder-esque soundtrack is another highlight, as is the band’s sly, appropriately faceless cameo. But as the story becomes more convoluted and less convincing, as entire plot strands are left hanging, as Hedlund smoulders and Bridges clings to his dignity, it becomes clear that this Tron isn’t going to satisfy any but the most undemanding fans. The door is left wide open for a sequel and the prospect remains a welcome one - but let’s hope they can do a comprehensive de-bug, and get this system running smoothly once more - Tom Huddleston]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The latest film from Woody Allen sees him back in London with the usual dramatis personae of arty types (novelists, gallery owners, painters, musicians, bookshop proprietors) and a predictably philistine hooker. Again there’s a bit of voiceover stuck in to help us negotiate the narrative’s structural shortcomings, but at least most of the cast do their best to inject some sort of emotional authenticity into the endless contrivances and coincidences. Centred on two problematic marriages, it’s the usual roundelay of romantic longing, frustration and folly with the characters falling inconveniently in love, falling out with each other and falling flat on their faces through a mixture of desire and delusion. The title alludes to the overall theme that it may be wiser to place our faith in illusions rather than in a reality that inevitably proves disappointing, a theme that provides the film’s funniest scenes in which Josh Brolin’s medic-turned-struggling writer argues with once-suicidal mother-in-law Gemma Jones, now convinced of reincarnation by clairvoyant Lucy Punch. Still, despite a handful of good scenes, much of the film feels tired, and some of it rather crass: that Hopkins becomes enamoured of a gold-digging bimbo hooker makes for the most fruitlessly stereotype-laden of the narrative’s various threads. But then maybe reality wasn’t what Woody himself was looking for; after all, the world he portrays here is the stuff of illusion, so perhaps he’s just hammering home his point - Geoff Andrew]]></review>
