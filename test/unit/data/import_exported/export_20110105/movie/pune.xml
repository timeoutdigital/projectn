      <review><![CDATA[Knight and Day is an action movie of the old school before everything was about massive digital battles royal. Superspy Tom Cruise fends off trained assassins without ever losing his trademark grin. Cameron Diaz is the innocent bystander swept up into his world of international intrigue when he uses her to get something past airport customs. They careen from Kansas to Boston to Switzerland to Spain with Central Intelligence Agency agents who think he’s gone rogue in hot pursuit. Between the magical cell phones that can deactivate car alarms, the surviving of an airliner crash in a cornfield and the astonishingly bad aim of the machine-gun-wielding baddies, this is a film that asks us to skip past suspending disbelief and go straight to expulsion.It’s a measure of how lumbering action movies have been of late that this works at all. Cruise’s weird mix of earnest concern and roguish flirtation gives his character an amusing topspin. Diaz does what she can, but she’s asked to be both a resourceful, classic-car-fixin’ mechanic and the screaming girl of so many action movies. There are some inspired moments thrown in amid all the running and shooting, but they feel like truffle shavings on a Big Mac. - Hank Sartin]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA["What a difference a decade makes. The last time M Night Shyamalan tried to form a franchise, he made the idiosyncratic and relatively unpopular superhero story Unbreakable (2000). His adaptation of the popular Nickelodeon animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender  plays like a rejoinder to that film’s perceived flaws, which means that it’s been leeched of all personality and given a hack-blockbuster burnish. Any computer could have directed this mythological mishmash about a reincarnated boy named Aang (Noah Ringer) and his fairy-tale quest to master the sorta-martial art called bending. Just strike a lot of fancy, Far East-flavoured poses, and control over the four elements – earth, air, fire and water – is yours.
It’s a hell of a party trick, though Shyamalan visualises Aang’s otherworldly powers with dull detachment. The camera swoops and the music blares, but we might as well be watching a tolerant parent filming his son’s karate class demonstration. Only Slumdog Millionaire’s Dev Patel, as the bastard prince of the villainous Fire nation, truly gets jiggy with the fantasy. A cliff-hanger ending, meanwhile, portends a series of sequels (this is but “Book One”). I smell another Golden Compass]]></review>
