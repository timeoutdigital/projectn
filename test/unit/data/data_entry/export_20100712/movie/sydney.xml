      <review><![CDATA[This portrait of the artist as a young man takes a few liberties. Screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh (Control) implies that Lennon was estranged from his biological mother until the age of 15, when, in actuality, Julia Lennon was a major presence in her son's childhood. The change is meant to strengthen the tension between the prim Aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott-Thomas), who raised John from the age of five, and the wilder, flirtier Julia (Anne-Marie Duff). The two women, we're meant to believe, represent the opposing forces that made Lennon the iconoclast he was: a product of a repressive era who burst free spectacularly.Thus Nowhere Boy has teenage John (Aaron Johnson) reconnecting with Julia following the death of his beloved Uncle George (David Threlfall). While Mimi tut-tuts in the background, Julia introduces John to American rock'n'roll ("know what it means, ‘rock'n'roll'? Sex," she reveals) and teaches him to play the banjo. Soon John is forming his first band, the skiffle outfit the Quarrymen. Though the Beatles are never so much as name-checked in Nowhere Boy, cheeky references are scattered throughout: the walrus that Lennon doodles in his school notebook, a sign for ‘Strawberry Fields,' and his mother's rendition of the folk song ‘Maggie Mae' on the banjo (a song that would later appear on the Beatles' final studio album Let It Be). Fans will also be amused by the epochal first meeting between Lennon and the lanky, awkward Paul McCartney (Thomas Brodie Sangster of Love Actually) - it's the first moment when Lennon's confidence in his own superiority is shaken. Aaron Johnson nails Lennon's mercurial temper and withering wit, while Scott Thomas and Duff offer complex portrayals of two fascinating women. And yet, there's something just a bit incomplete about Nowhere Boy. Since the audience comes armed with the foreknowledge of Lennon's impending superstardom, everything we learn about his struggles as a teenager takes on a gravity that it simply wouldn't possess if the story were just about a nameless, mixed-up Liverpool teen. Nevertheless, director Sam Taylor-Wood (a Turner Prize-nominated artist) makes every shot of her debut feature look like an award-winning photograph. The movie is also a joy to listen to, stuffed full of all the classic rock'n'roll that inspired Lennon - Elvis, Screamin' Jay Hawkins and Buddy Holly. The near-absence of Beatles songs is no drawback here. Michelle Lamont]]></review>
