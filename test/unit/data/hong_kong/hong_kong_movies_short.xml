                <name><![CDATA[The Savages ]]></name>
                <review><![CDATA[<p>The strength of<em> The Savages</em> lies in its sensitivity to the awkward, contradictory impulses that nurture and fray the relationships between siblings, lovers, parents and children. Strange, given this impressive emotional realism, that its most memorable sequences verge on the surreal: the film opens like Blue Velvet on vacation, with a sun-drenched, colour-saturated slow-motion sequence involving outlandish topiary, formation-dancing seniors, multiple golf carts and giant cacti.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is Sun City, Arizona, the retirement town where Lenny (Philip Bosco) lives with his partner and presents the angry outbursts and dirty protests of incipient dementia. When Lenny&rsquo;s partner dies, her family turfs him out, forcing responsibility on to his estranged children in New York: would-be playwright Wendy (Laura Linney), who&rsquo;s having an affair with an older neighbour, and Jon (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an academic working on Brecht and in denial about his Polish girlfriend returning home.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Subjects seldom aired in American cinema &ndash; ageing, compromise, death &ndash; take centre stage in Jenkins&rsquo; sharp, witty script, which captures well the short-cuts to affection and irritation that intimacy brings, even if it offers a too-neat arc of growth and redemption and several off-the-peg touches (cue words of wisdom from an African nurse).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The performances, however, are terrific. At one point, Jon sprains his neck, prompting an outlandish bit of DIY physiotherapy involving weights and a door-mounted neck brace. While he&rsquo;s ensconced in this contraption, Wendy reports winning a grant for which Jon was rejected. As envy, self-pity and pride compete for control of his features, Hoffman shows he can give an acting masterclass even with his head in a sling.&nbsp;</p>

                <review><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: medium">As he prepares to make his first English-language film, Johnnie To is in no mood to compromise. By <strong>Edmund Lee</strong></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing">Johnnie To sits before me, concentrating intently on the job at hand while I scan the collection of antique cameras scattered around the room. We&rsquo;re sitting in his impressively spacious office &ndash; situated inside the capacious Milkyway Building, which houses the offices and staff of his film production company, Milkyway Image &ndash; and To is performing a Gungfu tea ceremony with consummate skill. I&rsquo;m just pondering how to break the silence hanging over us when, finally, he looks up, offers me a cup and speaks. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have some tea,&rdquo; he says.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>The man behind such lauded and hip crime flicks as The Mission, PTU, and Mad Detective, as well as recent whimsical pickpocket drama Sparrow, seems relaxed. And why shouldn&rsquo;t he: Milkyway, the company he set up in 1996 with frequent collaborator Wai Ka-fai, has built a sterling reputation over the past decade, and To is about to introduce himself to a wider audience with a star-studded English-language remake of 1970 French classic Le Cercle Rouge.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>That To is now considered a bona-fide Hong Kong auteur is an indication of how far he has come from the early days of his career, when he presided over a chameleonic body of works ranging from silly comedies (The Eighth Happiness and Justice, My Foot!) to comically OTT action flicks (The Heroic Trio 1 and 2). Milkyway, however, has provided the platform for To to establish the hyper-stylized cinematic style that has become his trademark. In particular, it made possible the abrupt turn he took after his 1995 drama Loving You.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I turned 40,&rdquo; says To, &ldquo;I started to ask myself: do I really just want to continue being a technician? An operator? Or just a businessman? Then in 1995, I made up my mind that I really wanted to become a film director in the long term, making films that are decided by me and me alone &ndash; not the cast, nor the investors, nor the market. I have my very personal way of thinking, Johnnie To style.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>To&rsquo;s belated auteurism has not gone unnoticed on the big stage: the director has made frequent appearances in all the major European film festivals in the last few years. Indeed, in the past year or so, To hit each of the big three, with Triangle in Cannes, Mad Detective in Venice and Sparrow in Berlin. With such international exposure, it is perhaps unsurprising that To&rsquo;s next project should be his first English-language film, the forthcoming American-produced, Hong Kong- and French-funded remake of French director Jean-Pierre Melville&rsquo;s Le Cercle Rouge. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Melville&rsquo;s obsession with cool assassins and the underworld&rsquo;s code of honour bears more than a passing resemblance to To&rsquo;s usual motifs. But, as To reveals, the root goes much deeper: &ldquo;I started watching European films in my early youth, and they&rsquo;ve been exerting influences on me ever since. As I don&rsquo;t always realise those influences, sometimes I even think that I created it by myself!<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Melville is really my type of director, although Akira Kurosawa has to be my personal favourite &ndash; I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by the static world in his films, populated by characters each bearing his own baggage. Kurosawa and Melville are the biggest influences on my filmmaking.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>With a provisional cast that includes Orlando Bloom, Chow Yun-fat, Tim Roth, Liam Neeson and Lau Ching-wan (though not the hotly rumoured Alain Delon, star of the original, whom To approached for a different project), the new film could be an ordeal for a director known for his reluctance to get acquainted with new actors.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re using new actors, you have to accept that they have their own values,&rdquo; says To. &ldquo;These guys are stars. They want themselves to look really cool in the movie, and they won&rsquo;t care what the director is like&hellip; of course they want the director to make a good film, but at the end, what matters are their own performances. So if this project is to go ahead, I&rsquo;ll have to accept a very American way of thinking.&rdquo; To starts laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I won&rsquo;t be able to do it.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>He may be taking his newest step on the international stage, but To has no plans to relocate. Indeed, he intends to shoot the film in the same city that has provided the backdrop to his other works. &ldquo;The original script was set in France and UK, but I don&rsquo;t want to shoot the film there,&rdquo; he confesses. &ldquo;I want the film to be made in Hong Kong, because I want to continue making films in Hong Kong. I like this place very much.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>That said, does To feel his films are better appreciated elsewhere? After all, his internationally recognised films are not even among his own highest grossing movies locally.<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bloody obvious!&rdquo; To chuckles. &ldquo;You get standing ovations that last several minutes in those film festivals, whereas the Hong Kong audience just can&rsquo;t wait to leave the theatre when the credits start to roll! People here are not that interested in things that are not instantly rewarding. They play video games and surf the net, but are reluctant to use their brains. They look for films that proceed with high speed and don&rsquo;t require you to think. In the heyday of the local film business, cinemas used to increase the frame rate just to accommodate seven or eight screenings a day. It looked extremely unnatural, but the audience had no complaints.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>However, To insists such mass audience tastes will not alter the course he has chosen. &ldquo;As my experience with cinema increases, I realise that I&rsquo;m getting further away from box office success. But then I think, even though you can&rsquo;t get the biggest reward in the box office, at least you can attract a certain audience. I&rsquo;m more attracted by auteur theory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After graduating from film school, I wrote a lot of scripts and contacted a lot of film companies. I even tried to give one of my scripts to Robert De Niro, waiting for him for a week outside the door of his Tribeca Film Center. The security guard thought I was a stalker!&rdquo;<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>Wong Chun-chun is full of these inspiring stories about how she got where she is now, like how she financed her first feature film, the little-known A Carburetor for Suzy (1998), with the remaining balance of her credit card.<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>Now, emerging from her studio in a stylish outfit and a cap, she looks less like a movie director and more like an actress. As it turns out, she almost became just that. &ldquo;I studied acting at the HKAPA, but I had forgotten to take the commercial sides of things into account &ndash; like how short I am. I was an outstanding student though; I was even awarded a Jackie Chan scholarship in my last year!&rdquo; She bursts into a fit of laughter.<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>&ldquo;After I graduated I became a radio DJ for two years, all the while watching lots and lots of movies. I decided to study film [at NYU], especially as I was still young.&rdquo; After a moment of reflection, Wong continues, &ldquo;I still enjoy acting, but it&rsquo;s totally different from directing. When you&rsquo;re acting, you only need to concentrate on your own character; but when you&rsquo;re directing, you&rsquo;re portraying the whole world.&rdquo; <o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p></p>
<p>But nothing could have prepared that world for the frankness of her controversial documentary Women&rsquo;s Private Parts (2000). Shot on DV with an all-female cast, the film displays Wong&rsquo;s instinctive ability to get her interviewees to discuss sensitive topics such as masturbation, adultery and much, much more.<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>&ldquo;I got the idea when I met up for a drink with six or seven of my girlfriends,&rdquo; explains Wong. &ldquo;We were chatting away in the corner of a bar, near the men&rsquo;s lavatory. As we whispered cheekily about sex, we found that the men were slowing down on their way past us, eager to eavesdrop on our conversation. It was hilarious. It made me want to demonstrate to places like New York that Chinese women are not as conservative and submissive as they are perceived to be.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Three years later, Wong followed up with youth drama Truth or Dare: 6th Floor Rear Flat (2003). The film was a hit with the younger generation, popularising &ndash; if not introducing &ndash; the game of Truth or Dare in Hong Kong. Then, after the success of Truth, Wong returned to more contentious material with Six Strong Guys (2004), which revolves around a bunch of pathetic men, four of whom are preparing for a mass suicide attempt in the opening sequence. Now there&rsquo;s a new twist on the male-bonding clich&eacute;.<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>&ldquo;When men make films about men,&rdquo; says Wong, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re always making A Better Tomorrow &ndash; everyone&rsquo;s cool and brave. But I feel that men have problems of their own to deal with, so my objective was to look at men from a woman&rsquo;s perspective. It was full of good intentions, trying to encourage women to be more understanding towards men.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>Naturally, Wong was instantly labeled as a feminist director. &ldquo;I was like, &lsquo;are you serious?!&rsquo; I was praising men, showing their soft side, the pressures they have to deal with. I&rsquo;m the opposite of a feminist director.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>Wong&rsquo;s next film, Wonder Women (2007), didn&rsquo;t help. One of several films marking the tenth anniversary of the Hong Kong handover, it chronicles every disaster in Hong Kong in the past decade, from the Asian Financial Crisis and the SARS outbreak to the charcoal suicide trend. Again, the male gender seems to come out worse for wear. &ldquo;The film&rsquo;s based on a novel, though,&rdquo; says Wong, &ldquo;so it wasn&rsquo;t my idea to make the male characters suffer like that!&rdquo; There comes that laugh again.<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s it like being a female director in such a male-dominated industry? &ldquo;Actually, I think Hong Kong men are quite open-minded,&rdquo; Wong answers, generously. &ldquo;But there are two factors that you have to consider as a woman director: first you need a very clear idea of how you want to shoot the scene when you step onto the set. If you hesitate for a second, the crew goes, &lsquo;I told you so! She&rsquo;s just a woman! She can&rsquo;t think it through!&rsquo;&rdquo;<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>&ldquo;The other thing is that a woman can&rsquo;t cry on set. If you cry, the crew says, &lsquo;I told you women are incompetent! Just go home and make dinner. You can&rsquo;t deal with pressure!&rsquo;&rdquo; Open-minded indeed&hellip;<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>So, is Wong a feminist or not? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an individualist,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I feel that everyone should have their own personality, vision and freedom to do whatever they like, including sex. I absolutely don&rsquo;t think that women should have all the power. One of the happiest aspects of being a woman is to be able to rely on men occasionally. It&rsquo;s no fun if women control everything!&rdquo; Guess that&rsquo;s a no then.</p>

</strong></p>
<p>It is difficult to avoid contradiction when talking about Wong Jing; universally derided by critics, he is also one of the most popular filmmakers in Hong Kong, especially among the masses who go to the movies to switch off and have some fun.<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>Although largely unknown outside the SAR, Wong has directed more than 90 movies, produced 150 more and he just happens to be Hong Kong&rsquo;s highest grossing director of the past two decades, taking in over HK$1 billion in box office revenue. In fact some credit him with being responsible for most of the industry&rsquo;s livelihood. As the saying goes, &ldquo;when even Wong Jing doesn&rsquo;t have any new projects, things really must be bad.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>Wong has a simple explanation for his success: &ldquo;First, I&rsquo;m fundamentally a really good writer; secondly, I&rsquo;m very hardworking; and thirdly, I choose the right people to work with.&rdquo; Looks like modesty has nothing to do with it, then. But to give him credit where it&rsquo;s due, Wong did singlehandedly invent the gambling movie tradition that is so unique to Hong Kong. In fact, Chow Yun Fat&rsquo;s God of Gamblers (1989) is considered as one of the greatest classics of Hong Kong cinema.<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Chinese people are addicted to gambling,&rdquo; says Wong. &ldquo;Where there are Chinese people, there&rsquo;s gambling, so a gambling movie had to work. I came up with the idea in my twenties and I have never given up on it. It&rsquo;s my trademark.&rdquo; The tradition has given way to some wacky ideas along the way, like the scam to fake World Cup footage in The Conman (1998), with Andy Lau as Beckham and Nick Cheung as Ronaldo. Oddly, though, it works.<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>Besides the gambling movies, Wong has also capitalised on the parody film market, most notably with the first entry in his The Romancing Star series (1987), which stars Chow Yun Fat and Maggie Cheung, and gives Chow&rsquo;s previous movie A Better Tomorrow (1986) the thorough Scary Movie treatment. <o:p></o:p><o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Of the current state of Hong Kong cinema, Wong says that &ldquo;success isn&rsquo;t just based on good box office results, these days. Production costs can be much higher than a movie&rsquo;s actual revenue. It&rsquo;s getting harder to make any money.&rdquo; To make up for it, the already prolific Wong is busier than ever, sometimes attending up to nine meetings in a single day and writing new stories in his spare time. As our photographer sets up the lighting for the photoshoot, Wong wastes no time, going through and signing the phone-directory-sized stack of documents on his desk.<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>If anything, moments like these justify Wong&rsquo;s reputation as an exceptional businessman, regardless of the quality of his movies. But with more than a few dozen critically panned entries on his lengthy resume, how does the man feel about the critics who loathe his movies?<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>At the mention of critics, Wong gets visibly agitated. &ldquo;Only rubbish people would call my movies rubbish. What qualifies them to have an opinion? Critics are not God, and it&rsquo;s not for them to judge what&rsquo;s good or bad; the audience should decide. It&rsquo;s easy for anyone to use a pen to dismiss others. If I was to pick up my pen, they would lose 99 per cent of the time. I&rsquo;ve never, ever heard a member of the audience call my movies rubbish.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>To be fair, Wong has come up with some solid dramas in recent years, such as Colour of the Truth (2003) and Colour of the Loyalty (2005). &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just started a new project called Kingdom of Corruption. I think you have to do different things at different ages; I&rsquo;m a middle-aged man, so I should start tackling more serious topics. I made comedies when I was young, but there just aren&rsquo;t that many middle-aged people who can make successful comedies.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>Citing Norman Jewison, Lewis Gilbert, Terence Young and Martin Scorsese as his major creative influences, will Wong apply himself to art-house cinema next? &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never say no to anything; and I&rsquo;ve already made an arty film, Crying Heart (1999),&rdquo; he is quick to point out. &ldquo;Casino Tycoon (1992) is another one. My favourite art films are In the Mood for Love and Chungking Express. Happy Together is good, too. I like how these appeal to both the general public and the niche markets.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p>Speaking of arty stuff, has he thought of exploring the foreign markets as well? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ambitious. I don&rsquo;t need the whole world to kneel down before me. And anyway, if it&rsquo;s all so rosy out there, why did John Woo come back?&rdquo; Wong asks, grinning. &ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s for his love for China?&rdquo;</p>

                <review><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">Overplanning bride-to-be Kate (Longoria Parker) goes apeshit when the angel-shaped ice sculpture she ordered doesn&rsquo;t come with wings. The statue falls and kills her, and as it turns out, angels really don&rsquo;t have wings. Now a ghost, Kate won&rsquo;t pass on until she tells her fianc&eacute; (Rudd) that it&rsquo;s okay to love again. Instead she fixates on thwarting the object of his affection, a bumbling caterer and would-be psychic (Bell). Searching for distraction from the idiotic misunderstandings that ensue, you might contemplate whether the actor playing Rudd&rsquo;s sister is indeed Melanie Lynskey. (Actually, she&rsquo;s Sloane.) Curiously, the words &ldquo;a film by&rdquo; appear above the majority of the closing credits scrawl&mdash;deflecting blame onto the entire crew.</p>
