      <review><![CDATA[<p>To make the titular substance of Nadine Labakis Beirut-set first feature, sugar must be heated just so or the result will be a tarry disaster. Although certainly sweet, <i>Caramel</i>s liability is that it rests at too tepid a temperature.</p><p>For those whove seen <i>Venus Beauty Institute</i>or <i>Beauty Shop</i>the template will be a familiar one: the sororal setting and consciousness-raising-lite vibe of the salon. Various concerns bedevil the protagonists: Depilator Layale (Labaki) has a married lover; stylist Nisrine (Al Masri) hasnt told her fianc shes not a virgin; shampooer Rima (Moukarzel) likes ladies; customer Jamale (Aouad) fears aging. </p><p>The cast, primarily first-time performers, is charming, and every country (and culture) should have its own ya-ya sisterhood movies. But Labaki, who cowrote the script with two men, is too cautious. Rather than being Lebanons answer to <i>The L Words </i>Shane, Rima is allowed only a few furtive ogles on a bus and the ministering of a lather and rinse to a longhaired beauty. Then again, the soft butch sees more onscreen action than her pals. As Layale prepares to remove a customers errant hairs with caramel, she yells, Heat the sugar, please. One wishes Labaki had done the same for her filmperhaps by heating the sugar walls. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Faulting Tyler Perry for his nonsensical, melodramatic plots is a little like accusing Douglas Sirk of using too much color. In this soaper about four couples in various states of marital discord, Perry leaves the Madea padding behind; the fat enhancement is worn by Jill Scott, who finds the love of a good man in the Rockies. To the writer-directors great credit, he actually seems to <i>like</i> his characters, especially the womenwhich cant be said of most men who don fat-female drag. But note: Five cast members in Perrys film have appeared on the CWs <i>Girlfriends</i>, which, now in its eighth season, tackles the same themes with far more finesse and intelligence]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Its quite likely that Staff Sergeant William James (Renner)the bomb-defusing expert at the center of the terrific Iraq War action film <i>The Hurt Locker</i>was named by screenwriter Mark Boal after a certain pragmatic 19th-century philosopher. On the cleverness-to-profundity scale, that falls somewhere between calling a desert-island survivalist Locke and christening a living stuffed tiger Hobbes. But James is more than his moniker, not so much larger-than-life as eternally engaged, gruntlike, with the one thing he does better than anyone else. </p><p>Renner, whose half-muscled pudginess calls to mind Fassbinder circa <i>Fox and His Friends,</i> gets inside Jamess skin in ways that a more seasoned celebrity could not. Its a role that might have easily devolved into one-note paeans to badassery, especially in concert with an episodic story structure that constantly toggles between machismo-laden home-base drama and perilously prolonged fieldwork. Yet in this actors hands, the character comes off with a credible working-class clarityhes less concerned with performing kiss-off heroics than with doing a good job and pissing the night away. </p><p>The James-free prologue, which features the first of two kill-em-off star cameos, seemingly sets the stakes high. But director Kathryn Bigelow, doing her run-n-gun best, doesnt mine traditional suspense so much as impart a queasy feeling of monotony. <i>The Hurt Locker </i>is all about existing in an often repetitious moment. Superimposed titles count down the days left in James and his squads rotation, though theres little sense of movement toward an ultimate endpoint. As the opening Chris Hedges quote (War is a drug) suggests, there are no accomplishments in this line of work, only an unending round of highs, lows and in-betweens. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Germanys mountain film, or <i>bergfilme,</i> gets a semisuccessful modern update with <i>North Face,</i> which focuses on a failed, purportedly factual 1936 ascent of Switzerlands treacherous Eiger peak by alpinists Toni Kurz (Frmann) and Andi Hinterstoisser (Lukas). The movie features an abundance of melodramatic, emotion-stoking cues, most of them courtesy of Tonis old flame Luise (Wokalek), whos not about to let the mountain take her man. But its also colored, detrimentally so, by 20/20 historical hindsight. </p><p>Cleverly playing on the genres propagandistic ties to the Third Reich, the film reflects the tragic arc of National Socialism in each ominous crevasse and in every grandiloquent gesture. Yet all the retroactively enlightened symbolism gets monotonous, and reaches an absurd apex with the introduction of a party-line newspaperman played by that scowling emblem of Teutonic depravity, Ulrich Tukur (see also <i>The White Ribbon</i>). </p><p>Yet the visual splendora seamless mix of practical locations and refrigerated studio setscannot be denied. <i>Avatar</i>s swoop-n-slide digital fakery has nothing on the vertigo-inducing set pieces cooked up by director Philipp Stlzl and cinematographer Kolja Brandt. These range from the tried-and-true (those faulty carabiners are Pavlovian suspense generators) to the poetically inspired (a go-for-broke rescue mission is filmed to evoke Tonis literal tethering to the heavens). And never doubt the ability of creakily frostbitten fingers to elicit an empathetic spine shiveror a Damn, son! face crinkle. Indeed, its easy to ignore <i>North Face</i>s ill-conceived sociopolitical allegory whenever the mountain, a truly merciless antagonist, takes center stage.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Movies as sexy and colorful as <i>Broken Embraces</i> really shouldnt feel this boring. But thats the troubling thing thats happened with the work of Pedro Almodvar, whose catty, chatty melodramas now play like dutiful festival mainstays rather than truly vibrant alternatives. The Spanish director is too assured not to serve up a spicy mealand his longtime leading lady, Penlope Cruz, is riding a fascinating crest of post<i>Vicky Cristina Barcelona</i> complexity. But watching the new film is like getting upsettingly full on insubstantial tapas: You would never say no to just one more, but theres better.</p><p>After a standout opening seduction in which a blind man manages to charm an assistant half his age out of her jeans, the movie settles into a strangely stilted four-way. Theres the aforementioned lothario with the pen name Harry Caine (Homar), once a popular film director but now a screenwriter in the dark; his former producer, a shady businessman whom we see only in flashback; the young secretary they both shared as a lover (Cruz); and a mysterious, intense videographer (Ochandiano) out for unspecified vengeance.</p><p>Shifts in tone between comic frustrations and romantic jealousy are elegantand too polite from the maker of the sparky <i>Talk to Her</i>. Were supposed to care about the fate of a botched farce, stolen from the directors hands and disastrously recut, but such editing-table discussions are stalled in an echo chamber of Hitchcock allusions (mainly for snobs only). Eventually, the movie meanders to a lost-father story and one revelation too many. Almodvar needs to push himself again.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>You boys seem a little on edge, offers Leonardo DiCaprio to the cops guarding an island of the damneda mental institution. Now, the amateur sleuth in you might take this as a clue. Hmm. That, or the Transylvanian fog, ridiculous even for Boston. Or the tug captain who actually says, Storms coming! Comfort surely doesnt arrive in the form of spooky Ben Kingsley, as the residing headshrinker; Max von Sydow, never a jocund presence, isnt far behind. Its all what the experts call dramatic foreshadowingif by that, they mean a centurys worth of chimney soot.</p><p>Martin Scorseses <i>Shutter Island </i>isnt subtle. Its a 50s-set thriller that wears its craft like a cloak with the collar up. Fans of the directors wicked rethink of<i> Cape Fea</i>r (1991) will insist hes done this before and expertly. But whereas that movie played to Scorseses class-conscious strengths, this one plunges us deep into loony-bin territory. (Its Scor-crazy.) A violent patient is on the loose and our marshal heroes, Teddy (DiCaprio) and Chuck (Ruffalo), offer pursuit, stubbornly racing around the island as the wind whips. But already, the histrionic style gives away too much.</p><p>If the material, adapted by Laeta Kalogridis from Dennis Lehanes slippery novel, disappoints, you can still count on Scorsese for punch. So many of his famous sequences are charged with a dream logicindeed, the whole of After Hoursthat when he finally allows himself to make proper nightmares, they blow you away. Teddys dead wife haunts him in vivid color and scenes of falling ash. (She perished in a fire.) There are swirling papers and flashbacks to Dachau, of all places. Still, coming from <i>Scorsese,</i> Shutter Island is slumming: minor but enjoyably nuts.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Still, someone was definitely using their brain when they omitted that piece of information. Even without the added portent,<i> The White Ribbon</i> comes dangerouslywonderfully?close to playing like an evil-kid flick. Were never told the year, but the setting is agrarian: a farming hamlet in northern Germany before the start of the First World War. Class divisions are stark. The landowning baron (Tukur) rigidly presides over his many employees, who comprise much of the town. Farmers seethe when one of their number accidentally dies. A ferocious pastor (Klaussner) offers little in the way of compassion or wisdom.</p><p>Watching all of this are the bright, thoughtful eyes of young people; <i>The White Ribbon</i> never lacks for incident, but it truly takes off when it hews to impressionable minds quietly considering the fate of a fallen horse, a wounded bird, a blinded mentally ill peer. Who is responsible for these crimes of vengeance? Shot in a crisp monochrome by Christian Berger, the movie not so subtly approaches its theme of moral inflexibility. The writer-director is Michael Haneke, whose severe perfection has, in the past, been put to thornier purposes (2005s majestic <i>Cach</i>), but never ones this important. Finally, the Austrian master is digging up the very roots of fascism; these are the abused children who, decades later, would stare at horror with the same curious eyes, both as witnesses and perpetrators.</p>]]></review>

While the others trade in stop-motion precision and CGI physics, this one goes fully for abstraction. Its a brooding story set firmly in the Dark Ages and Celtic legend. When smoke billows over the walled, titular enclavea home to gentle monks and familiesthe plumes come in looping, circular scribbles and your mind has to make the leap. (It does.)</p><p>In Kells lives young Brendan (McGuire), who, shepherded by his severe abbot father (the tart-tongued Gleeson), intends one day to illuminate a book with his goose-quilled pen. The boy yearns to see the outside world, though, and this is where he goesthe mostly hand-drawn animation morphs into strange new shapes as the trees narrow, crows caw menacingly and a female fairy slinks around in the form of a snowy panther. Its all fairly enchanting, and theres the added euphoria of being free of the incessant pop-culture riffing of either Disney or Altman-loving hipster directors. The movie isnt quite suitable for the extremely young, but its apocalyptic tint may be catnip for smart preteens. Theyll breathe in the chilly air of a mysterious forestthe way forests should be. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Dont let the surface sensationalism of Andr Tchins latest chilled melodrama fool you: Per its opening disclaimer, the movie is only inspired by the true story of a 23-year-old Frenchwoman who was the victim of an anti-Semitic attackonly to later admit shed lied about the whole thing. In fact, despite <i>The Girl on the Train</i>s dissection into two distinct chaptersCircumstances and Consequencestheres little to suggest Jeanne (Dequenne) is any different from your typically restless youth. She Rollerblades around Paris, lives at home with Mom (Denueve) and enjoys the attention of an aggressively flirty amateur wrestler (Duvauchelle). Then tragedy strikes her boyfriend, and out of nowhere, the goyish Jeanne draws a swastika on her belly, cuts herself and claims shes been assaulted by Arab immigrants. <br /></p><p>Tchin offers a character study in lieu of context for the similar 2007 hoax that threw the French press into a tizzy, and like many of his best films, this what-if examination works best as an actors showcase. For those of us whove been fans of Dequenne since her role as a blanc-trash Belgian waif in Rosetta (1999), her subtle portrayal of the pathological perpetrator proves that shes monumentally talented. But if the directors trademark elliptical approach doesnt turn the tabloid fodder into a film-eclipsing circus, it fails to shed much light on the incident either, reducing the lethargic Consequences section to the equivalent of a shrug, and Jeannes rationale for fibbing to wanting to feel loved. Thankfully, we arent given hand-wringing or easy blame-game answers. Nor, however, are we given anything resembling sociological resonance, or much reason to care.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Its a glorious moment for prison moviesused to be wed have to scrape with spoons in the dark until the next cable airing of <i>Escape from Alcatraz</i>. But last years two triumphant jail dramas, <i>Bronson</i> and <i>Hunger,</i> have just arrived on DVD, and now comes what must be the ultimate cell-block saga. <i>A Prophet </i>is nearly three hours of shanking, squealing and surviving: a riveting narrative about the nature and accrual of power. Its easily the best film to come out of last years tepid Cannesor maybe several Cannes. Advisably or not, director Jacques Audiard had delivered a kind of a how-to <i>Scarface </i>without the tiger in the backyard; even though this Gallic crime-specialist (<i>The Beat That My Heart Skipped</i>) has distanced himself from such comparisons, theyre there for the taking. And yet, <i>A Prophet</i> is redeemed by its intellect.</p><p>Arriving at a noisy French prison is 19-year-old Malik (the deeply sympathetic Rahim), who resembles less a hard-timer than a yummy cupcake. He quickly toughens up under the brutal tutelage of Corsican kingpin Csar (Arestrup) and the movies grueling tale multiplies in complexity. Razors are stashed in mouths, the yard divides racially, and Malik learns to score drugs and favors. The undercurrent of <i>A Prophet</i> is Audiards bracing naturalism: The camerawork is often handheld and jittery but suffused with an ominous sense of poetic fate. (A deer crossing is milked extensively.) There are dealings on the outsidesuppliers, a cancer-addled compadre, some scary shoot-outsbut the movie zings along with perfectly-paced verve, punctuated by Tarantino-esque title cards. Why do we care? Because never before have the steps to thugdom, as depressing as that destination may be, been so rigorously detailed, neither romanticized nor negated. Dont miss.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Among the things you can learn at the movies this week: Benito Mussolini was red-hot in <i>il sacco.</i> As a sexy union organizer, the budding fascist (Timi) looms large in bed over the pale body of our heroine, Ida (Mezzogiorno), one hand throttling her neck, his eyes bulging with dominance. She digs it. Its not long, plotwise, before Ida is splayed nude across the bed, having sold all her possessions to fund a newsletter. Even as her man is swept away on a tide of populism, Ida carries the flameshe sees the plebs rising up to salute his image at the cinema and knows she was there first.</p><p><i>Vincere,</i> an extraordinarily operatic affair, then becomes the ultimate he-never-called-me-back film. (It should have been marketed as an artier <i>Hes Just Not That Into You</i>.) The real-life marriage claim of Ida Dalser remains contested, but its clear that Mussolini returned from the WWI front a changed man, prone to eliminating records and erasing the inconvenient. The movie plays up these reversals of fortune with epic, Italianate sweep, born aloft by Carlo Crivellis juicy wall-to-wall score, a spikier take on Ennio Morricones lushness. Ida cries at the bars of her mental institution while passersby call her Mussolina; Benito Jr., the grown-up love child (also Timi), also goes crazy and starts spouting a spot-on impression of Papa. </p><p>Almost as an afterthought to the ringingly true performancesand Marco Bellocchios unusually approachable directioncomes a deft analysis of fascism, likened to lovesickness, insanity and a gust of orchestral strings. Its all of that and more, not to mention a lousy matchmaker.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Given the months-long hype, whats most bewildering about Sundance sensation Precious is its overall shrug-worthiness. Youd think the litany of horrors that befall Harlem teenager Clareece Precious Jones (Sidibe)illiteracy, rape, domestic abuse, Mariah Careywould register with some piercing and perceptive effect. Instead, they pass by with the glazed-over, lookie-lookie luridness of a <i>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</i> episode. </p><p>And yet, at the films center is a fully lived-in performance by newcomer Gabourey Gabby Sidibe, who will hopefully go on to better things and not be cast aside, <i>Slumdog</i>-style, in the post-awards season. The actor holds her own with such scene-stealers as MoNiquedangling her cigarettes with Oscar-baiting malevolence as Preciouss mom, Maryand navigates the neorealism-lite trappings with brazen, always arresting confidence.</p><p>The films best scenes take place in a literacy class headed by a tough-love educator (Patton). Its here that Precious finds the means to express herself in ways reminiscent of Celie, the uneducated heroine of Alice Walkers novel <i>The Color Purple</i>. Indeed, director Lee Daniels seems to be aping Steven Spielbergs adaptation of <i>Purple</i> (specifically the sequence where Celie discovers a long-hidden pile of letters from her sister) in the moment when the camera circles Precious while video images of Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, et al. are projected around her. The meaning is the samehistory floods the consciousness of both Celie and Precious and powerfully widens their worldviewbut Danielss methods are decidedly cruder. Its hardly surprising that, in another instance, he emphasizes the revulsion of incest by cutting to a pan of sizzling eggs. Even the worst behaviors, he appears to be saying, have to go over easy.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Zoe Kazan doesnt exactly explode hereits more the churning upset of lovesick implosion. (You dont have to be a doctor to realize that her character, Ivy, also coping with epilepsy, has a serious case of boyfriend-attention disorder.) She lolls around Manhattan and Brooklyn during a brief break from college, quietly yielding to the vibrations of her cell and flirting in that infuriatingly blank way perfected by hipsters.</p><p>Yet it would be a mistake to confuse Bradley Rust Grays slender drama for another bit of disposable mumblecore. <i>The Exploding Girl</i> plunges us deep into the wide eyes of its up-and-coming star, who almost certainly wont find a better vehicle for her quiet, cherubic charms. The incidents of the movie are minimal: walks, naps, rooftop hangs. Still, you calibrate to Kazans loping paceas well as that of a potential suitor, Al (Rendall), not quite the lure that we hope for. The movie is inward and vaguely gothy; not for nothing does its title reference a Cure B-side. (If you know the song, consider that a personal invite.) You begin to pick up a feeling for the warm weather and well-judged locations.</p><p>Gray and his filmmaker-producer wife, So Yong Kim (<i>In Between Days</i>), are something of a rising force in indie cinema. There have been arguments about whether their underdramatized moviesincluding last years <i>Treeless Mountain</i>are beneficial or represent settling for less. Heres a corollary opinion: When you have an actor as suggestive as Kazan, swallowing up the lens with allure and complexity, your writer-director becomes superfluous. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Wes Andersons stop-motion-animated Roald Dahl adaptation is one for the auteurist in us all: Newspaper-columnist-cum-chicken-stealer Mr. Fox (Clooney) dresses like his director, drives his family bonkers like Royal Tenenbaum and even has a Steve Zissouesque epiphany courtesy of a Black Power! fist-raising wolf. The overall sensation is of an artist repeating himself, scaling down his obsessions to empty-vessel miniatureat last, Anderson has made a film that is <i>nothing</i> but a succession of autumn-gold shoebox dioramas. </p><p>Its unfortunate that the result is so unaffecting, especially in light of all the things the director does right. Theres plenty here to thrill animation buffs, and Andersons most inspired choice was to record the majority of the actors in scene-appropriate locations (barns, fields, basements), which minimizes the studio-miked disconnect between voices and characters that hampers a good many animated films. Coupled with the often caressingly extreme close-ups of these singular puppet creationsits wonderful how the animals fur quivers slightly in each frametheres never any doubt that were in the presence of a precisely conceived world. And thats the problem. Theres usually a hand-of-God meticulousness to Andersons work, but something inexplicably soulful almost always manages to intrude. Its this aspect that elevates the best of his films, like the section in his underrated India picture, <i>The Darjeeling Limited,</i> in which the brothers stumble upon a drowning village boy and are forced to deal with something horribly outside their comfort zone. Theres no such quality in <i>Fantastic Mr. Fox,</i> which is all hermetically hollow gestures and poses. Thats what I do, says Mr. F. when asked about his trademark whistle-and-tooth-clicking salute. All Anderson does is slavishly further the brand. <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Actor Carey Mulligan is filmed like a goddess in <i>An Education.</i> In looks and demeanor, she seems caught between prim elegance and outlaw modishness, appropriately suggestingin light of the storys period settinga 60s-era Audrey Hepburn. This starlets performance is the best reason to see an otherwise jumbled adaptation of Lynn Barbers memoir, in which Mulligans disaffected British teen, Jenny, has a transformative adolescent experience. </p><p>Jennys life is a predictable succession of prep-school testing, youth orchestra and parental protestations, until the fateful day when a handsome stranger offers her a lift during a downpour. Hes David (Sarsgaard), a man nearly twice her age, who pours on the charm with all the irresistible come-hitherness of a Tex Avery wolf. </p><p>But hes still a wolf: Fancy dinners and impromptu trips to Paris are the norm, yet theres something off about David, a creepiness underlying his seeming perfection. Sarsgaard is expert at implied malevolence, though hes less convincing as a refined man of the world (hes one of the few performers now working who can be both perfectly cast and miscast). </p><p>The bigger problem is the way in which this cautionary coming-of-age tale is told. Lone Scherfig directs it all as if it were a breezy lark, so a third-act tonal shift makes for an incongruous, excessively moralistic fit with everything thats preceded. Most insulting, though, is the way in which the climactic passages miraculously tidy up every frayed edge of Jennys life. Who knew that an Oxford education had the healing power of Lourdes?</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In bringing Perraults three-page folk tale of a murderous old hermit and his steely young bride to the screen as a stripped-back gothic miniature, Breillat has produced what could be one of her most instantly pleasurable films to date. Cheerily narrated by two young sisters as they read the story to one another in a dusty attic, the drama of how newly destitute Marie-Catherine (Creton) accepts the repugnant Bluebeards (Thomas) hand in marriage plays out in a series of sparse, elegantly constructed tableaux which ride on a pair of wonderfully sad-eyed performances from the leads. Some fans of the director may be disheartened to hear that there is no sex or nudity to speak of, though the film still offers a clear-sighted admonishment of patriarchal entitlement along with a stark contemporary relevance.<br />]]></review>

The opening credits have barely rolled and shes already gotten her close-up; sad to say, the film that follows feels comparatively like an afterthought. </p><p>Kim plays the unnamed mother of the title, who runs an apothecary and dotes on her mentally challenged son, Do-joon (Bin). They have a queasy relationship, something Bong emphasizes during an early scene in which Mom is so obsessed with keeping her boy in view that she nearly slices her finger off. Blood runs deep in this family and, if youre familiar with the directors work (<i>Memories of Murder; The Host</i>), you know theres a great likelihood that its somehow going to be spilled. </p><p><i>Mothe</i>r does indeed bear this out, though not before spending a laborious amount of time on a murder plotinvolving Do-joon and a promiscuous schoolgirlwith narrative twists that thud like a two-by-four to the skull. Bong is so concerned with whodunit that his creaky genre mechanics diminish Kims determined performance: Shes often shunted to the side of the action, especially when Do-joons friend (Jin) comes forth to do some teeth-cracking kick-assery that panders to the fanboys.</p><p>And though the film beautifully visualizes Mas last-act plunge into blissful ignorance, Bong fails to give her fate any substantive sense of tragedy. By the time he rounds his way back to the opening scene, the character has lost all emotional pull, and her hysteria rings hollow.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Christopher Isherwoods seminal queer novel deserves a film adaptation that captures both its sense of place and its activist spirit. Cowriter-director Tom Ford settles for the glossy ephemera of a <i>Vanity Fair </i>cover spread. Both Isherwood and Ford follow Brit-expat college professor George (Firth, dully competent despite the film festival plaudits and Oscar buzz) through a single, sun-baked California day at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis. But only in the film is there a hoary motivating factora suicidal death wish stemming from Georges mournful pining for his dead lover Jim (Goode)meant to round off edges that should remain jagged. (The most frayed thing onscreen is, tellingly, an angora sweater.)</p><p>Fords biggest mistake is making George a martyrdom-ready symbol; too many movies subscribe to the regressive notion that queers are unassailable victims of fate and circumstance. One of the most revealing amendments here involves a flashback in which George is informed of Jims death and is refused an invite to the funeral. Theres no such melodramatic manipulation in Isherwoods tome, where George is invited to the funeral and refuses out of a fascinatingly contradictory mix of pride, prejudice and anguish. It deepens his humanity rather than making him allegorically alien. </p><p>Isherwood set out to normalize his gay protagonists experience, showing the many different poses he assumed within a seemingly routine day (in that context, masturbation was as mundane yet significant an occurrence as driving on the freeway). Ford privileges sexual preference over all else. Its the defining trait of his Georgea <i>Camille</i>-esque affliction signaled by a portentous cough and overcome in a sacrificial ending that turns Isherwoods beautifully enigmatic final passages into a poisonous, irony-laced tear-jerk.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Tellingly, one of the codirectors of this deeply humane Arab-Israeli dramaPalestinian filmmaker Scandar Coptialso plays its most empathetic character: Binj, a likeable, long-bearded stoner. True to his name (or at least its sound), he seems to be suffused with the modern possibilities in Israel: dance clubs, cute Jewish girlfriends, recreational drugs. Binj works happily in a kitchen in Jaffa, a subdivision of Tel Aviv and a tense melting pot. Alas, even someone as laid-back as Binj is drawn into the regions endless cycle of violence, which the expertly woven Ajami presents as inexorable.</p><p><i>Ajami</i> is Israels submission to the Oscars, and like the gritty <i>City of God</i> before it, it takes harrowing, tricky circumstances and illuminates them with Scorsesian snap. You might get a little lost in the folds, but the anchors are solid: Along with Binj, we meet a sweet Arab teen, Omar (Kabaha), who unexpectedly becomes a gang target; a younger kid, Malek (Frege), who finds himself on the verge of drug dealing to pay for his mothers bone-marrow transplant; and Dando (Naim), a heavyset Jewish cop and daddy searching for his disappeared brother. Culpability is not ignored in these strands: Everyones a little guilty and the total picture is a vivid one. The combustible movie has had a strangely unifying effect on audiences worldwide; it deserves to find traction where it counts.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Heath Ledgers final onscreen performance, in Terry Gilliams notoriously troubled production, is clearly truncated, despite the semisolution hit upon by the cowriter-director after the actors death. Whenever he ventures into the films amorphous fantasy world, Ledgers charismatic con artist, Tony, is played by Johnny Depp, Jude Law or Colin Farrell. The mechanics of the transformations are sound, but these three last-minute replacements arent able to make the characters journey resonate emotionallythey never fully shake the sense of being <br />stand-ins.</p><p>Fortunately, Tony is more of a supporting player in Gilliams fantasia. The real drama in Parnassus comes from the troupe of sideshow performers, led by a terrifically morbid Christopher Plummer, who bang about modern-day London in a rickety horse-drawn transport that unfolds into an oversize proscenium. Its a film teeming with visual invention (often to the point of exhaustion), yet the big-budget pageantry is always counterbalanced by Gilliams deeply felt and thematically potent sympathy for the downtrodden artistes of the world. And Plummer and Tom Waits (as a bowler-hat-clad Old Scratch) help keep everything on track with their immortals-doing-battle routine, which comes to a deeply affecting head after one of them is reduced to a Lear-like vagrant. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Theres a line from Jurassic Park that echoed hauntingly through this critics head as Avatar unfolded: Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they <i>could</i>, they didnt stop to think if they <i>should</i>. James Cameron is one of those scientists: so in love with the technology, with the possibilities, that he never pauses to reflect upon the practicalities of cinema, of storytelling, of connecting with an audience.<br />That quote is doubly relevant when one considers the cultural similarities between these two blockbusters, both of which justified massive expense by promising a quantum leap forward in visual effects. But where Spielberg utilised technology in the service of a tight, witty script, Cameron is simply out to astound. There are moments when you almost expect Sam Worthingtons moody, ever-present voiceover to be replaced by the self-styled king of the world yelling at his audience: Are you awestruck now? How about now? Now?<br />When his scientist brother is killed a week before shipping out to the distant planet Pandora, wheelchair-bound US Marine Jake Sully (Worthington) is offered the chance to go in his place. On Pandora, Jake meets his avatar, a remote-controlled host body generated from his brothers DNA and designed to blend in among the native Navi, a race of nine-foot blue hunter-gatherers living in peaceful harmony with their homeworld, Native American style.<br />Or rather, Native Californian: Navi civilisation is a mishmash of half-formed Hollywood ideas about the supposed superiority of primitive cultures, tossing around buzzwords like spirit and energy without ever approaching a cohesive set of beliefs. But all this tree-hugging shit, as Jake describes it, is only the most obvious defect in Camerons dire, clich-ridden script. From the bluntly expositional nature of the early scenes to the gung-ho, sub-Aliens banter of Jakes fellow soldiers, this is screenwriting on autopilot, cobbling together unripe ideas without a scrap of originality or emotional resonance. <br />Its hard to fault Avatar as an immersive visual experience. Pandora and its luridly coloured inhabitants are beautifully designed, though none of this ever feels remotely real. But this was  supposed to be the movie that changed the face of filmmaking forever. Ultimately, Camerons signature achievement may have been to prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the oldest of all Hollywood maxims: all the money in the world is no subsitute for fresh ideas and a solid script.]]></review>

Grandchildren assemble around terrible documents; Christiane Kubrick (widow of the famous director and Harlans niece) relates a tale of her Jewish husband feeling like Woody Allen in the propagandists presence. Still a mystery: Harlans own sense of guilt. But theres plenty to go around.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Football fans know that the blind side is the quarterbacks vulnerable spot when hes scouring the field for a pass. Moviegoers attuned to the metaphorical nature of film titles can guess, however, that the phrase applies to more than just grid-irony in John Lee Hancocks based-on-a-true-story parable. Societys blind side, you see, is where impoverished, hulking African-American athlete Big Mike Oher (Aaron) lived until plucky Southern mother Leigh Anne Touhy (Bullock) took him in. (Tough-talking mamas from Tennessee: What <i>cant</i> they fix?) As for the saving glories of the game, youve first got to suffer through an hour of Big Mikes bleached-blond guardian angel dropping saintly Hallmark platitudes. Youve changed his life, one character tells Leigh Anne. No, she says, complete with elongated dramatic pause. Hes changed mine. Garrggh! Just bring on the sports-movie clichs already.</p><p>Its tempting to think that this vanilla take on a stock inspirational tale exists solely to make an expressionistic emotional steamroller like <i>Precious</i> seem even more graceful than it is. Whats worse than its triteness, however, is the way the movie regards this at-risk youth as nothing other than a vehicle for making suburban moms feel better about themselves during the postscreening drive to Costco. Is this some sort of white-guilt thing? a ready-made villain asks rhetorically. Actually, no; its just blinkered middle-class pandering at its most shameless.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Prone to slipping into corny comedy and, worse, confusion over its viewpoint, Michael Hoffmans biopic of Leo Tolstoys final year filters its historical drama through a turgid coming-of-age experience. The authors acolyte Valentin (McAvoy) is commissioned by a literary <br />fanatic (Giamatti) to assist the Russian writer (Plummer) and spy on the households goings-on. At Tolstoys country estate, things become tense thanks to an impending decision to bequeath his work to the public domain and, in doing so, leave his disapproving wifethe Countess Sofya (Mirren)out in the financial cold.</p><p><i>The Last Station </i>never decides if this famous figure is a saint, a loon or merely an infirm old coot being exploited by his followers. Its an indecisiveness that the director extends to his misshapen characterizations of the frequently freaking-out countess and the virginal Valentin, whose education in love is embellished by a drearily cute penchant for sneezing when nervous. Working with uneven material, the illustrious cast is too often stranded in a realm of tony, high-art campnotably a hammy Plummer and Mirren suffering through a foreplay scene that requires the celebrated veteran actors to crazily coo cock-a-doodle-doos to each other. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Its bad enough that Nancy Meyers latest conventional romcom is blessed with a title so bluntly unimaginative as to seem facetious; the rub is that its not even a truthful assessment. Divorced baker Jane (Streep) embarks on an unexpected and ill-advised affair with her former husband, Jake (Baldwin). As this swaggering ex is now married to a hot young psycho (Bell) and Jane <br />is also falling for her dorky architect (Martin), this amorous development supposedly turns circumstances knotty. Yet in Meyerss milquetoast hands, the way the scenario plays out isnt so much tricky as treacly, with sporadic bursts of sitcom goofiness.</p><p>The writer-directors rickety portrait of middle-aged loneliness, regret and self-consciousness is propped up by Streep and Baldwins natural love-hate chemistry and joint refusal to succumb to slapsticky ridiculousness. Nonetheless, a greater focus on off-the-wall humor would have benefited Martin, whos shamefully saddled with being the plots perfunctory third wheel. More mirth and less tear-streaked schmaltz might have alleviated the tales dramedy dawdling, as Meyers goes to such unnecessary lengths to craft allegedly complex protagonists that the comedy soon goes down like lead. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>For those of us who find somber superhero movies faintly ridiculous, <i>Kick-Ass</i> is a one-film justice league. It might be the best recruiting tool the geek squad ever had, puncturing fanboyish obsessions and reinvesting them with passion. Slyly, the movie starts off with a sick jokean awful skyscraper leap by a pretender in a winged costume. (Too bad the title Jackass was already taken.) Only a little later, our self-admittedly bland high-school hero, Dave (the likeable Johnson), buys a turquoise scuba suit and quickly finds himself gut-stabbed by amused thugs. Peter Parker had it easy.</p><p><i>Kick-Ass,</i> briskly adapted by British screenwriter Jane Goldman and director Matthew Vaughn from Mark Millars savage comic, has a lot more on its mind than approximating a live-action Wile E. Coyote sketch. Dave dangerously accrues fame through a cruddy viral video, resulting in plenty of innocent carnage. Meanwhile, real-life criminals get pissed off and the laughs start to hang in your throat. Vaughn (<i>Stardust</i>) knows hes on to more of a giddy-nauseating satire of vigilantism than anything square-jawed; he lunges at ideas of unearned celebrity via a pot-smoking spoiled supervillain called the Red Mist (Mintz-Plasse, seriously upping the ante from <i>Superbad</i>s McLovin). </p><p>By the time we get around to a stunning 11-year-old (Moretz) chopping the legs off goons with amoral glee, its hard to miss the subversive pointthat ass-kicking fantasies make more sense as the ambitions of sugar-addled kids. (Expect gasps.) The emotions, however, are adult-sized: A paternal turn from Nicolas Cage is a hint of what his aborted Superman might have beenan overwrought hoot. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Bridges, for all his glorious achievements, still hasnt been celebrated enough. A technical actor (remember <i>Starman</i>?) who manages to make every gesture a perfect one, hes been paired with difficult material over a meandering career and always succeeded. So if this better-than-average country-singer tale does the trick come Oscar time, heres someone who wont complain. Bad Blake, much like Bridgess immortal Dude, is belly-acting: gutsy and, well, big-gutted. The number of times Blake is seen emerging from a pickup truck with his belt unfastened is almost a running joke. Rambling through a series of Texas bars and vomiting behind them, Blake is haunted by a musical protg whos become a huge star (Farrell). His own glory days are long behind him.</p><p><i>Crazy Heart</i> pairs this fascinating private strummer with a curious journalist (Gyllenhaal), who soon shares with him a bed and the affections of her daddyless young son. For the movies first hour, you perk up at the vibrations of sympathetic emotions, pitched at a quiet frequency not heard since <i>Tender Mercies.</i> (The appearance of Robert Duvall is a bonus.) Upsettingly, though, someones decided that such intimate moments are not enough for a night of entertainment, so a manufactured kid-in-jeopardy climax and Blakes rehab stint blow the mood. Until then, this is great American acting.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>pologies to all of you whove been looking forward to Lewis Carroll getting the Tim Burton treatment. For this loose amalga-daptation of both<i> Alices Adventures in Wonderland </i>and <i>Through the Looking-Glass,</i> Burton is in dispassionate, for-hire mode, which means hes more concerned with computer-generated eyesores than with the character, Alice Kingsley (Wasikowska), whose subconscious theyre meant to represent.</p><p>Alice is no longer a girl, but a woman in her late teens facing an arranged marriage to a snooty stick-in-the-mud. While mulling her situation, our heroine is drawn back to Wonderland by the White Rabbit. Its there that a prophecy is unveiled (damn prophecies!) saying Alice will slay the monstrous Jabberwock, whos been terrorizing the land at the behest of the literally big-headed Red Queen (Carter).</p><p>Save the terrific<i> Sweeney Todd</i>, Burton hasnt convincingly visualized a dreamworld since his mid-90s heyday. The grounding psychology of his fantastical characterslike his two Eds, Wood and Scissorhandshas eluded him since hes gone green screen. Its especially damaging in this case, since the Alice novels are all about a girls inner life made animate. </p><p>Wasikowska certainly looks the part, but we never get the sense that this placeor playth, as Johnny Depps lisping, unmemorable Mad Hatter might sayand its populace spring from her psyche. Shes basically lost on a Burtons Greatest Hits ride at Disney World, where even an ostensibly inventive character like the films toothy, dematerializing Cheshire Cat feels like a weightless derivative of the directors more tangible past creations. And unlike Carrolls perversely idealized protagonist, Burtons Alice is just another anachronistic feminist tearing down Victorian patriarchal norms. Even her[<i>shudder</i>]Avril Lavigneblared theme song is a skin-deep grrrl-power accessory.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Foxs foray into Bollywood examines the fallout of 9/11 on NRIs (Non Resident Indians) in Bushs America. Khan (Shah Rukh Khan), a Muslim man with Aspergers syndrome, travels across the USA in order to meet the President. My Name is Khan; I am not a terrorist is his mantra. Karan Johar, Bollywoods biggest director, admirably addresses a sensitive topical issue within the widest commercial context. He incorporates marital strife, communal conflict, racism, bullying, a mamma subplot, and a catchy soundtrack (frustratingly not subtitled) to convey his progressive agenda. The result is a film of tonal inconsistency which reflects its simplistic good people/bad people view of human nature. Technically accomplished, its always engaging due to the credible performances from its beautiful leads, the charismatic Khan and Kajol. Worthy, but flawed.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Lie to us, we ask on this pinkest of holidays. Tenderize us until were raw and chompable. This is why a director like <i>Pretty Woman</i>s Garry Marshall even has a career to begin with, so woe be to those who enter his manically upbeat ensemble comedy, <i>Valentines Day,</i> with dark clouds overhead. Even the movies designated sad sacks (notably an inexplicably lonely Jessica Biel, who turns in a small miracle of nervousness) have long-telegraphed happy endings in store by the close of the day. A florist (Kutcher) grapples with his engagement rejection while his cute best friend (Garner) bites her lower lip in sympathy. A secret phone-sex worker (Hathaway) is career-outed in front of her uptight boyfriend; will he melt in understanding? (Hint: Hes played by Topher Grace.) As L.A. stories go, were a long way from Robert Altmans <i>Short Cuts.</i></p><p>And still: The surprising thing here is how smoothly this over-iced cake goes down. You know youre getting schmaltz, but as with Britains obvious forebear <i>Love Actually</i> (2003), there are enough tart lines and gestures to elicit a certain admiration. The feisty Shirley MacLaine plays one scene in front of her sylphlike, younger selfprojected behind her on an outdoor movie screenand its todays incarnation that grabs you. Blond awards-magnet Taylor Swift reveals an unexpected gift for self-deprecating sunniness, chattering vacantly in an elevator to a stranger. And even Marshalls megawatt beamer, Julia Roberts, turns in a smart cameo as a returning soldier. But of all of them, Ill take the waiter in a bruised mood, who sullenly declares, Ill come backwhen youre serious. Hell be waiting a while.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Every so often, you get the gift of watching an under-the-radar actor bloom into a critical-mass phenomenon before your bloodshot eyes: Franka Potente in <i>Run Lola Run</i>, or Christoph Waltz in <i>Inglourious Basterds</i>. Add Noomi Rapace to the list; what she does with the title character of this Swedish thriller-cum-pop-lit-adaptation will spawn cults of swooning Rapacephiles stat. Of course, the heroine of Stieg Larssons Scandi-noir best-sellerthe first volume of his megapopular Millennium trilogywas hardwired for instant iconic status, but lets not damn with faint praise. After watching this wispy young woman dig her talons into the goth-garbed, bisexual biker-chick hacker Lisbeth Salander, youll have witnessed a star being brn. <br /></p><p>Lisbeth is just a piece of director Niels Arden Oplevs deep, degenerate puzzle, even if she eclipses everything around her. A disgraced journalist (Nyqvist) is hired to investigate a decades-old mystery; photographs contain clues, biblical passages are codes, and the scribe and his pierced, pixie-ish sidekick race around trying to find out whodunit. Oplev himself speeds through the storys plot twists like hes on deadline, but importantly, the filmmaker nails the books indictment of the sexual-predatory vibes seemingly embedded in Swedens landscape. Vengeance, however, will be Lisbeths; just give this abused hellion a tattoo gun, a camcorder and an actor who can bring her to screaming, sucker-punching life. Mission accomplished. <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Were so used to amped-up white-knucklers that the controlled approach of a filmmaker like Roman Polanski is immediately seductive. The director responsible for such mainstays as <i>Chinatown</i> and <i>Rosemarys Baby</i> (and of course his own real-life news cycle) turns Robert Harriss political potboiler involving a ghostwriter (McGregor), a former British prime minister (Brosnan) and an isolated island home into a slow-burn near-masterpiece. Shot in claustrophobic widescreen, the film showcases Polanskis mastery of even expository scenes: A revealing conversation between McGregors so-called ghost and a shady figure played by Tom Wilkinson is so fraught with tension that you expect those malevolent Cocteau-esque hands from<i> Repulsion</i> to burst out of the wall and drag someone into oblivion. <br />The film stays more grounded than that, though it certainly doesnt lack for perverse Polanski flourishes. Theres a great bit of carnal business with the prime ministers wife (Williams) thats filmed in a deadpan long shot. Eli Wallach pops upfrail-looking though spiritedas an old-timer who stokes the writers paranoia about his employers plans for him. And more than one character has a wry aside on the protagonists heritage (Oh, you Brits!), as if it was both a badge of honor and a reason for condescending suspicion. <br />There are all number of similarly colorful touches (the sick-joke ending alone is worth the price of admission) that help to deepen what one colleague suggested is the greatest airport novel ever filmed. Its true that <i>The Ghost Writer</i> doesnt possess the lingering profundity of the directors best workthe War on Terror window dressing is just that. Yet Polanski has made a genre piece with a verve and vitality thats in sadly short supply. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Not since a Nam-scarred Sly Stallone asked, Do we get to win this time? in <i>Rambo: First Blood Part II </i>has an American action star been deployed to rewrite history so thoroughly. Matt Damon, while only an Army warrant officer in the ridiculous <i>Green Zone,</i> gets pretty mouthy in his futile search for Iraqi WMDs: This intelligence is bullshit! he informs superiors and slower viewers. Going rogue, the character shocks a Judith Miller reporter type (Ryan) into conscience, shouts down a Rumsfeldian Washington worm (Kinnear) and tries to spring a prisoner from an Abu Ghraiblike compound. A CIA fat cat (Gleeson) ogles babes by the pool in the protected zone while the real deal goes down in night vision. Ultimately, a heroic e-mail will be sent to the worlds journalists, certain to publish the truth. Aw, yeah: the power of the presswith backbone!</p><p>Lets not blame Rajiv Chandrasekaran, author of the credited 2006 source account, Imperial Life in the Emerald City (much goosed by inspired screenwriter Brian Helgeland), for the misfire. The real disappointer is director Paul Greengrass, who, with United 93 and his earlier Bloody Sunday, pulled off small miracles of tact. Greengrass is better known for the last two Bourne moviesagain, superior fantasies inspired by modern terror. <i>Green Zone,</i> though, has him fumbling mightily, grabbing for big moments with shockingly dumb dialogue (Dont be naive!) and turning the Iraq War into a Bond film. The director still cuts footage with the deftness of a jazz player, and some might consider this to be his most daring, idealistic movie; its like a big, revisionist do-over. Alas, hes pushed himself into a weightless place where his skills are moot.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Desperation oozes from every frame of <i>Cop Out,</i> which front-loads its best jokean aerial pan from Manhattan to Kings County scored with the Beastie Boys No Sleep Till Brooklynthen spends the rest of its running time endlessly spinning its wheels. Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan are partners in law out to recover a stolen baseball card from some badass Hispanic gangsters. How we arrive at that golden nugget of a plot complication is something for the Robert McKees of the world to illuminate; for the rest of us, this is some soul-sapping dada with which director Kevin Smith is staining his already-dubious rsum.</p><p>The actors constantly indulge in unfocused improv: Morgan is given what feels like a full reel to unleash an unfunny succession of re-created film scenes, each followed by a reaction shot of Willis telling us what said scene is supposed to be (<i>Heat!; The Color Purple!</i>). The camera later fleetingly catches game supporting actor Kevin Pollak doing a spot-on De Niro impersonation, and its like seeing the difference between mastery and cacophony. Nearly all the jokes are spewed as if they were a barrage of bullets. Thats fitting, since this purported comedy is also senselessly violent: Guns are fired with reckless abandon. Blood is carelessly spilled. And amid all the carnage, were supposed to give a damn about whether Morgans wife is cheating on him and if Willis can give his daughter a dream wedding on a cops salary. Then theres the Seann William Scott stoner scenes, but, really, why prolong the torment? <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Taking a page from the <i>Dawn of the Dead </i>04 playbook, this entertainingly shallow remake of George A. Romeros 1973 horror film opens with a clever use of Johnny Cash (crooning the Dr. <i>Strangelove</i>closing ditty, Well Meet Again), then jumps right into the societal breakdown. A man goes nuts at a baseball game. Our hero sheriff (Olyphant) shoots him through the noggin. Seems theres a destructive force, later determined to be a government-engineered virus, working its way through this small Midwest American town.</p><p>Director Breck Eisner (<i>Sahara</i>) has a talent for in-the-moment tension (theres some pretty memorable business with a pitchfork and an autopsy saw), and it often feels like the characters are plunging headlong through a grisly Rube Goldberg gauntlet. All of which is a lot of fun, until the realization sets in that very little is going on beyond the fright-feature anxieties.Unlike Romeros film, whats missing is a trenchant sense of connection to our historical moment. The original <i>Crazies</i> perceptively shuttled back and forth between bureaucratically hampered Army men and a paranoid populace; it had Vietnam firmly on its mind. Here, the goal is clearthe sheriff and his pregnant wife (Mitchell) need to get the fuck out of Dodgebut the world around them is a half-baked hash of antimilitarist sentiment and goosey jump-scares: Operation Iraqi Hodgepodge.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>A far cry from the gritty 70s policiers it conjures with cock-of-the-walk swagger (<i>Serpico, Prince of the City</i>), Antoine Fuquas second-rate retread of his own <i>Training Day</i> is a bloated, multithread drama concerning three burnt-out cops at the end of their seemingly unconnected ropes. Just a week away from receiving his pension, spiritually ruined man-in-blue Eddie (Gere) would rather let crime run rampant than do paperwork; he wakes up each morning to a glass of whiskey and a cocked gun in his mouth. Then theres Officer Tango (Cheadle), whose undercover duty has been so overextended that his loyalties and moral compass have shifted to protect his gangland pal Caz (Snipes). Yes, weve seen that type of hot mess before. And gee, will underpaid narcotics cop Sal (Hawke) ditch his few remaining scruples to make the down payment on a new house for his baby mama, pregnant with twins?</p><p>Across the board, the capable cast of <i>Brooklyns Finest</i> works hard to sell a soulful intensity, which isnt easy considering that each of the leads could proclaim theyre getting too old for this shit at any given moment. Unsubtly scripted by former NYC transit worker Michael C. Martin, the film plays like the inverse of <i>Crash</i>a faux-intricate exercise in crosscutting fatalism that points fingers at its characters rather than the audience. Rock bottom is never as close as it appears and what goes around comes around (and all that noise), but for a character-driven piece digging up old tropes about the strains of humanity buried within corrupted people, the constant threat of violence seems to be its only dramatic momentum.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hollywoods campaign to convince audiences that beefy Scots bulldog Gerard Butler can play the romantic lead gathers pace with this misjudged marital crime caper. Butler plays Milo Boyd, an ex-cop turned bail bondsman assigned to haul in his ex-wife Nicole (Jennifer Aniston), a hotshot reporter in deep with the law. The pursuit takes this pair of bickering exes from New York to Atlantic City and back, via a series of perfunctory car chases, poorly choreographed punch-ups and excruciating romantic entanglements.<br />The trouble is not so much that Butler isnt funny  he isnt, even slightly  but that he sucks the merest hint of humour from the entire enterprise. Even proven performers like Aniston and Christine Baranski as a sexually voracious mother-in-law are reduced to desperate mugging and hysterical arm-waving in an attempt to fill the comic vacuum which their muscular co-star leaves in his wake. To be fair, the script gives them little to work with: there are maybe three decent laughs, interspersed with long stretches of interminable, would-be witty banter and one near-unwatchable comedy torture scene. <br />The score, too, is atrocious: infuriatingly cheeky in the comedy scenes, switching to screeching Bon Jovi-esque AOR whenever things kick off. The Bounty Hunter isnt bad enough to be offensive: its simply lazy, trite, smug, irritating and a colossal waste of time, talent and money. Therell be worse films released in 2010  but not many.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Jay Baruchel is the gentlest of the Apatow geeklings, more a mascot to sweathogs like Seth Rogen than an equal. (His spindly boxer in <i>Million Dollar Baby</i> looked beatable by even Hilary Swank.) So it makes sense that Baruchels first star vehicle, a twitchy, frequently funny affair, emphasizes the scrawn factor: <i>Shes Out of My League</i> casts him as a polite Pittsburgh airport-security worker, Kirk, dwarfed by the epaulets on his uniform and the pushy advice of his man-gang. When a bombshell traveler, Molly (Eve), makes her way through the gate, shes seen as a human being only by Kirk, who returns her iPhone and boggles at the possibility of her being attracted to him.</p><p>You might feasibly expectindeed, hope forthis to play out like a zanier <i>Say Anything </i>(judging from Baruchels rawness, he does, too). But were hardly in that romantic ballpark; the promising material, penned by the writers of the underrated <i>Sex Drive,</i> skews closer to Farrelly brothers slapstick than sweetness. One gag involving a loving act of manscaping by a heterosexual friend will make you want to vomit; you sense that<i> The Hangover</i> loomed large over this production. Still, Eve has a true flair for zingers, and the movies heart survives intact. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Fathers know foolishness best in this culture-clash family comedy, which presides over a cursed union of slushy sentimentality and dim-witted humor. Two lovebirds (Gross, Ferrera) wreak havoc among their clans by announcing their intentions to marry. Such news is upsetting to their respective not-so-proud popsa playboy radio personality (Whitaker) and a clingy car restorer (Mencia)who immediately begin volleying racial and class-based insults at each other.<br /></p><p>Paternal bickering and egomaniacal prejudices soon give way to slapstick fighting, which in turn leads to clichd crises (the couple starts to reconsider their relationship, other relatives find love amid the matrimonial chaos) and Kumbaya reconciliations that are as predictable as the scripts intolerant slurs are tame. A variety of peripheral players fulfill the stereotype quota, with African-Americans represented as party-hearty lotharios and Mexicans cast as traditionalist kooks. Aside from an uncomfortable-looking Carlos Mencia, who seems to actively cower before the camera, the cast is robotically efficientthough thats not the same thing as coming out of this lifeless mess unscathed. Itll take years of yeomans work for Forest Whitaker to repair his onscreen reputation after allowing himself to be humped by a runaway goat hopped up on Viagra.</p>]]></review>

One alpha-male bet with his roommate later, Tylers on a retributive datebut then love begins to bloom. </p><p>Sex is had, past secrets are revealed, but all is not well in Camelot, as director Allen Coulter and writer Will Fetters shamelessly hint via snatches of summer 2001 news broadcasts (its a period piece, see) and a telegraphing glimpse at a certain pair of buildings. I cant say any more beyond telling you that I came out of the screening with an ear-to-ear grin I dont usually get from even great movies.

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Once upon a time, a nebbishy New Yorker could fall for a willowy shiksa goddess and you could call it <i>Annie Hall.</i> No longer. Now, the whole movies got to be set in Los Angeles (not just one Christmas sequence), our love object barely gets a single la-di-da, and forget about naming the film after her. Weve got inner male pain to address.<br /></p><p>That shift, though, is precisely what makes<i> Greenberg,</i> Noah Baumbachs latest comedy-drama, so car-crash-arresting and emblematic of Gen X self-absorption. Baumbach, an expert at skewering urbane pretensions (<i>The Squid and the Whale</i>), has conceived a remarkably sour character in Ben Stillers furious letter writer and fortyish layabout, Roger Greenberg. Once a college-rock musician, he scotched his bands momentum in a fit of principle and now suffers the consequences: occasional work at carpentry and pride-swallowing in the home of his much wealthier brother. A ratty Steve Winwood T-shirt speaks volumes, as does a shelf of meds and a constant stream of bile directed at partygoing kids who scare him with their potential. Rogers just not fun to be around.</p><p>Baumbachs idea here is to find an expiration date on boyishnessits tempting to compare Greenberg to the more-trenchant <i>The Anniversary Party</i> (2001), also a shrewd examination of the limits of youthful decadence (and partly created by the filmmakers wife, Jennifer Jason Leigh, as is this). This movie corrects its wobbly, negative spiral with the romantic development of Florence (Gerwig, spacey as ever), a personal assistant to Rogers sib and perhaps a salvation. Scratch that perhaps: <i>Greenberg</i> only slightly misses the top flight by settling for too weak a foil. (The better option, Rhys Ifanss bruised bandmate, is right there.) But when Stiller indulges in moments of unfulfilled rage, this has real desperation. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For the past year, 3D has been a guarantee of box-office gold, as proven by the runaway success of Avatar. But now, for the first time, a film arrives for which the 3D element may prove to be a commercial hindrance. Its not only that Clash of the Titans will compete with Alice in Wonderland, How to Train Your Dragon and Avatar for the nations 3D screens. More critically than that, the film's conversion to 3D (a decision taken late in the filmmaking process) has rendered this campy, unashamedly old-school but still highly enjoyable blockbuster rather painful to watch.<br />In story terms, Clash of the Titans doesn't stray too far from the beloved 1981 Ray Harryhausen classic which spawned it. The setting is mythical Ancient Greece  an age of Gods, monsters and muscular men in little chainmail skirts. Sam Worthington is Perseus, an orphaned demi-God drawn into the battle between man and the immortals when Hades (Ralph Fiennes), lord of the underworld, threatens to unleash his great sea-beast, the Kraken, on the city of Argos. Accompanied by a ragtag band of warriors, Perseus sets off to learn the secrets of the Kraken and end the reign of the Gods once and for all.<br />Theres no ignoring the fact that Clash of the Titans is a mess: the plot is episodic and rushed, the dialogue blunt and occasionally laughable, and there are far too many characters, few of whom leave much of an impression. Both Worthington and love interest Gemma Arterton look like theyre on a strenuous Aegean package holiday, but luckily theyre surrounded by the likes of Fiennes, Pete Postlethwaite and Liam Neeson as Zeus, whose commanding, armour-clad presence seems, at times, to be the only thing holding this crumbling edifice together.<br />Other notable names dont fare so well: Danny Huston gets a mighty fake beard but just one line as sea-God Poseidon, Mads Mikkelsen does little more than bare his teeth as burly swordsman Draco and, most egregiously, Jason Flemyng gets a terrific backstory and some superb melting-face makeup as ruined ruler Calibos  and that's it. It's is a recurring problem throughout the film: with dialogue and character motivation cut back to the bare minimum, theres no way for anyone to express themselves except through action.<br />But, luckily, this is where Clash of the Titans succeeds. Whatever the flaws in the script, theres no faulting director Louis Leterriers visual ambition: this is a film of mighty vistas, beautifully designed beasts and intense, well-structured combat sequences, all rendered in eye-popping, though still rather fake-looking, CGI. Taking the lessons of The Lord of the Rings to heart, Leterrier goes all-out for excess: his computer-generated camera soars above sprawling cities, endless deserts and blasted underworld hellscapes, lending the film a dizzying, epic scale.<br />A shame, then, that the addition of 3D has rendered much of this grandeur all but unwatchable, blurring the image to a headache-inducing degree and adding absolutely nothing to a film which was obviously shot in two dimensions and should have stayed that way. As an experiment in high-Hollywood style over substance, Clash of the Titans is a very entertaining ride. But take our advice: sidestep the 3D and see it the old fashioned way. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Wasnt it only yesterday that Dakota Fanning shrieked her way into your splitting headache in <i>War of the Worlds</i>? She was just 11 back then, and in this fast-and-loose dramatization of the flameout of the 1970s proto-grrrl group, shes all of 15. Fannings costar, vamp bait Kristen Stewart, isnt that much more experienced (she can vote). The two make for an uncomfortably tarted-up frontline as, respectively, blond yowler Cherie Currie and future-bad-reputation-disregarder Joan Jett. Its exactly as it should be; the bands story is a cautionary one. So if you feel yourself getting protective, the movie is doing its job.</p><p>The two underage characters meet, naturally, in a bar over drinks, shoved together by creepy L.A. entrepreneur Kim Fowley (<i>Revolutionary Road</i>s Shannon, the only truly anarchic presence in the whole film). Soon enough, theyre crammed into a motor home with the rest of the band, working on chord ch-ch-changes and sliding inexorably toward drugs, soft-core lesbian sex and Japanese fame. As styled by video director Floria Sigismondi, the film mainly glances on these surfacesits more giggly goofy than coke-in-the-bathroom naughty. (Only vinyl collectors will insist that a serious legacy has been sullied; the plot is as contrived as the group itself.)So you dont blink an eye when the prefab wheels run off the railstheres very little pathos here for something presumably informed by Curries 1989 memoir. Still, you do get a sense of the moment when glam was being fought out in American high schools, and teen sex was barely contained in tight pants. Theres lots of volume in these tunesthe soundtrack is killerand at least everyone gets their rocks off. <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Who would think that a sleepy seaside snippet of the Bronx could foster a Faulkner novels worth of family skeletons? Vince Rizzo (Garcia) is a prison warden guarding two big secrets from his family: a moonlighting stint as an aspiring actor, and Tony (Strait), a grown son from a past fling who shows up as an inmate. Our guilt-ridden everyman takes probationary custody of his close-relations convict, setting off a chain of mishaps: Tony proceeds to make eyes at both Vinces wife (Margulies) and his teen daughterwhos secretly stripping to pay for collegewhile urging Vinces teen son to indulge his online fetish for obese women.</p><p>Somehow, writer-director Raymond De Felitta pulls off these proceedings way better than anyone has a right to, thanks to his light touch with potentially lurid plot developments and his generosity in letting actors flesh out their sitcom setups. Strait, a heartthrob in the making, almost steals the film from Garcia, who channels outer-borough local affably, if a bit thickly. Theres an inevitable clusterfuck climax of accumulated secrets that explode into histrionics, but what precedes the heavily accented sturm und drang is handled with delightful deft.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Well concede the point: This collection of testimonials from North Korean escapees is no Sunday-afternoon stroll, but it is a horrifying-fascinating peek into a hermit kingdom thats a bigger mystery than life on other planets. Kim Jong Ils dictatorship and its prison camps are sketched in a portrait of communist tailspin that evokes the most medieval moments of the 20th century. Obviously, this is not a tough case for a filmmaker to make, especially with geopolitics off the table and other aspects of the totalitarian country having already been explored in other docs (e.g.,<i> The Red Chapel</i>). But the first-person accounts here are vividthe terrors of starvation, slavery and midnight flight. One mans escape was inspired by a smuggled copy of <i>The Count of Monte Cristo;</i> a typical story begins, The first time I ate a mouse"</p><p>Director N.C. Heikin sympathetically wraps things in piano music and dance sequences that suggest bodily freedom; its not an entirely successful gambit, and gives the movie an unpolished insistence. But the filmmaker strikes gold in her varied selection of defectors, especially the military man fed up with the myopic chain of command. Nutty propaganda reels are here too, naturally, but even that glorious-leader kitsch screams prison camp more than camp.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its a time-honoured tradition among ageing rock stars with dwindling audiences to go back to the time that made them famous: nostalgia sells.<br /><br />Now John Cusack is applying the same shtick to movies: having tried his luck as both action hero and romantic lead, with Hot Tub Time Machine, Cusack returns to the slapdash, high concept 80s comedies that made him famous. And concepts dont come much higher than this: following a mysterious incident with an outdoor Jacuzzi and a can of nuclear-powered Russian energy drink, Adam (Cusack) and his three friends find themselves rocketed into the past, forced to relive the craziest night of their teenage lives before they can find a way back to the good old twenty-first century.<br />Hot Tub Time Machine conforms a little too closely to the post-The Hangover comedy template of a gang of drunk middle-aged losers with loud voices, bad attitudes and dubious ideas about women. But where this film scores over The Hangover is in the script, which replaces brash overconfidence with a looser narrative structure and a shaggier, more playful sense of humour.<br />It also does a great job of recreating the style and content of the 80s comedies it so lovingly pastiches, namely girls with big hair, pounding synth music and skisuit-wearing preppy douchebag villains. Giving his most charming performance in years, Cusack keeps the film sweet-natured when his more outrageous co-star Rob Corddry threatens to go overboard. No masterpiece, perhaps, but Hot Tub Time Machine is post-pub perfection.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The 3D bandwagon keeps rolling with this smart, muscular, animated adventure. On a remote North Atlantic island, the Viking population is suffering harassment from swarms of marauding dragons, until geeky son-of-a-chief Hiccup finds an injured dragon in the woods and suspects this constant state of warfare may be unnecessary.<br />Rejecting the comic whimsy of Cressida Cowells source novel, How to Train Your Dragon is a surprisingly robust affair, backing its juggernaut narrative with a well-judged and timely political subtext which urges young viewers to question received wisdom and make up their own minds, especially when it comes to matters of life and death. The voices can be jarring  the burly adult Vikings are all Scots, while their offspring are whiny Yanks  and the characterisation remains disappointingly old fashioned and unoriginal. But the visuals are striking, the script sharp and well paced and it all wraps up with a breathtaking aerial battle sequence.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[So whos playing the Emilio Estevez role? Jude Law? Forget it  this nasty non-thriller shares nothing but a similar title with Alex Coxs nutty 1984 head trip through LA, and mores the pity. Here, were in that gone-to-pot near-future so beloved of filmmakers, where Law and Whitaker (pictured) are pals and colleagues working in a debt-recovery department with a difference: they recover human organs. The film pitches friend against friend as Law ends up with a new ticker and darts about town with fellow post-op target Alice Braga in tow. Ideas, excitement and logic are ditched in favour of blood and gore  and theres no fun to be had watching operations and knife fights. Law and Whitaker are disastrous in the lead roles. Its a dreary and violent film that betrays its three years spent on the shelf.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of Dear John comes another Nicholas Sparks weepie. You know the drill: boy meets girl, while we wonder whos going to die. But while Dear John had capable, charismatic leads, The Last Song stars a guy from Neighbours (Liam Hemsworth) and Hannah Montana (aka Miley Cyrus). Hemsworth is not so bad, but Cyrus doesnt convince, believing a toothy pout is a catch-all for any emotion but happiness. And her character pouts a lot: teenage Ronnie is sulking with her father (Greg Kinnear) while spending a summer at his beachhouse. Her parents have split, so shes wearing a lot of black, but she starts brushing her hair when local hunk Will (Hemsworth) comes on the scene. As a chaste romance ensues, things are enlivened by 13-year-old Bobby Coleman as Ronnies brother: a cute, characterful kid, hes the one wholl get you laughing and blubbing. Anyone but Cyrus fans will find this one of the more inferior Sparks adaptations  and yes, that includes Nights in Rodanthe.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The epitome of Frances early-80s <i>cinma du look,</i> Jean-Jacques Beineixs thriller was a flipped bird to those who thought the country produced only artsy-fartsy ruminations on angst. Why, no! cried the young director. We can also make Euroslick eye candy, and heres exhibit A.</p><p></p><p>Though the storyinvolving an obsessive opera fan (Andri), a prima donna (Fernandez), corrupt cops, music pirates and the ol incriminating-tape-slipped-in-a-bag chestnutis somehow both convoluted and wafer-thin, <i>Diva</i> has other things working in its favor. Only a blind man would argue that cinematographer Philippe Rousselots visuals dont wow on a primitive level, especially once the sleek-chic shadows start dominating the screen and the geometric neon fashions nudge the movie toward Nagel territory. Youd also have to be a serious killjoy to shrug off the films extraordinary chase scene through the Metro or deny that Dominique Pinons performance as a diminutive punk henchman is damned near iconic.</p><p></p><p>But lets say youd like something out of <i>Diva</i> other than bright lights and big aesthetics borrowed from Hollywoods playbook. We wish you luck. Admirers can counter that the films style is its substance <i>[Yawn],</i> yet that still doesnt make this anything more than an elaborate, subtitled exercise in blowing hot air. Time hasnt changed that one bit.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Set in a pregentrified Park Slope, Hal Ashbys provocative Me Decade dramedy isnt as clueless as its protagonist is about cultural clashes. It may, however, be just as conflicted about color and class. Audiences are immediately invited to ridicule Elgar Enders (a baby-faced Bridges), who purchases a tenement in Brooklyn on a larkespecially once the Caucasian casually announces that the current African-American occupants must vacate.</p><p>Before we can properly affix our sneers of superiority, however, we meet Elgars superficial family (the scene becomes even more squirm-inducing when Bridges decries their racismby dumping soup on a <i>black</i> manservant) and watch the community were supposed to sympathize with demonstrate a painfully righteous hostility. His relationship with a woman (Bey) of mixed race, laced with genuine tenderness, and another sexual liaison that echoes earlier plantation owner accusations only muddy the waters further. Then Lee Grant and Pearl Bailey bond over ham hocks and hooch. Dont get me started on Robert Klein with burnt cork smeared all over his mug.</p><p>An elder spokesman of New Hollywoods vanguard, former editor Hal Ashbys debut film keeps veering away from expectations and easy answers: Sharp satire might suddenly segue into Norman Lear sitcom territory, while social problems remain unsolved when the credits roll. The movies too flawed to be a true neglected masterpiece or a satisfying time capsule for a hood whose boutiques-and-brownstones makeover speaks volumes. Yet <i>The Landlord</i>s view on the racial divide remains anything but black and white, and its knotty, nuanced take on where the twain cant meet deserves a reassessment.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>If theres anything less funny than suicide, its the notion that the afterlife is a simulacrum of ones pre-offed existence in which everything is a little bit worse (for instance, there are no stars and no one smiles). But Goran Dukics shaggy yet assured <i>Wristcutters </i>manages to draw humor and warmth from just such a premise, while finding pathos in what couldve been a vapid, high-concept lark.</p><p>Based on a 1998 short story by Israeli writer Etgar Keret, the film concerns Zia (Fugit), a stroppy twentysomething whos bumming around the suspiciously L.A.-like purgatory when he discovers that his beloved ex-girlfriend has also done herself in. He embarks on a quest to find her, along with devoted Russian sleazeball Eugene (Whigham) and a beguiling hitchhiker (Sossamon) who may be in limbo by accident. The trio ultimately arrives at a camp run by a crusty sage (Waits), at which point the sly jokes begin to give way to twee magical realism. <i>Wristcutters</i> is redeemed throughout, however, by Croatian-born Dukics darkly absurdist sensibility and bittersweet understanding that despair is tragically, hilariously portable. Fittingly, it ends with a pair of hard-earned, heart-melting smiles</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Connoisseurs of cinematic quirk are bound to find something worth liking in Shira Geffen and Etgar Kerets everything-that-plummets-must-converge concoction. Feel like some magical realism? Photographs spring to life and mute girls walk out of the sea. How about those always-reliable deadpan digs at bad art? Submitted for your disapproval, heres a ridiculous, avant-garde version of <i>Hamlet,</i> complete with soft-shoe routines and repetitive chanting (For I must hold my tongue/Tongue, tongue, tongue!). What about overlapping story lines, in which odd coincidences and chance meetings result in healing epiphanies? Oh, youll feel like youve died and gone to Heaven.</p><p>An Israeli writer known for his wry short stories, Keret (along with Geffen, his partner in both crime and life) imbues <i>Jellyfish</i>s parallel narratives with a signature fabulist sensibility. Its a given that the lives of the disaffected waitress (Adler), the broken-footed bride (Knoller) and the homesick Filipina caregiver (De Latorre) will intersect. Whimsy will occasionally be mistaken for profundity, and there will be hugs. Along the way, the films burps up enough emotional moments pitched between funny-ha-ha and funny-tragic to underwrite the movies Camera dOr win at Cannes last year. But the offbeat path is now a well-beaten one; perhaps its time to try something truly different.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It begins in the aftermath of battle. Lone survivor General Pang (Jet Li) staggers from the wreckage a changed man, vowing to conquer China and end centuries of bloodshed and infighting. For Western audiences, the popular rebirth of Eastern cinema has been eye-opening. This represents another peak in that development, taking a familiar lust-for-glory narrative and investing it with boundless energy and drive.<br /><br />Side-stepping the cold-steel visual perfection of Hero and the fairytale detachment of Crouching Tiger, the film hews closer to Spartacus, revelling in gloriously directed slash-and-burn battle sequences as Pang and his bandit brothers cut a gory swathe across the continent. But the film becomes more pensive and emotionally rewarding in the final act, shedding the mythic trappings and becoming a tragedy, as our broken heroes learn the corrupting influence of power.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Initially, the stop-motion animated feature $9.99 resembles one of those foulmouthed <i>Davey and Goliath</i> parodies from <i>Mad TV.</i> Yet as the first sequence makes abundantly clear, director Tatia Rosenthal and screenwriter Etgar Keret arent poking funtheyre deadly serious. A semiabsurdist dialogue between white-collar worker Jim Peck (LaPaglia) and a bearded homeless man (Rush) builds to a blood-splattering punch line that decisively sets the films melancholic tone. Animation is so often used for frivolous flights of fancy that its something of a shock to see it employed in the service of a tale that emphasizes human foible and mortality. </p><p>Thats not to say <i>$9.99</i> lacks for bizarre sights: The homeless man sprouts angel wings; a pot-addled slacker converses with three Lilliputian drunkards; a muscled repo man reinvents himself as a hairless blob to please his model girlfriend. These world-weary characters, all of whom live in or around the same apartment building, may be grounded in earthly problems and pursuits, but the fantastic always intrudes. The films title is the price of a self-help book, purchased by Jims neer-do-well son, Dave (Johnson), which promises to reveal the meaning of life. Happiness, or at least a happy ending, would seem to be the ultimate goal for everyone involved. Yet Rosenthal and Keret consistently play on audience expectations, especially in the recurring image of a piggy bank with an endearing yet horrifyingly fixed facial expression. Its cute beyond belief, but we keep waiting for the damn thing to spring to life and bare a sharp set of teeth. Theres a fine line, it would seem, between uplift and insanity.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This dumb and mostly fun fish-out-of-water comedy would be more dumb and much less fun if it wasnt for some amusing casting and a punchy running time that acknowledges the limits of its script. Tina Fey and Steve Carell are Claire and Phil Foster, a married New Jersey couple with a damp sex life and a damper social diary who decide that a date night away from the kids is well overdue. But when Phil, in a moment of unusual boldness, steals the reservation of the mysterious Triplehorns in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, they find themselves the unlikely target of gangsters headed by a self-mocking Ray Liotta. The script is lowest-common-denominator stuff  mistaken identity, car chases, strip clubs, boat rides  but the rapport between Carell and Fey is easy to warm to and an episode involving a shirtless Mark Wahlberg as an old friend of Claires who challenges Phils uneasy masculinity provokes genuine laughs. Fey and Carell are better than this, but when the other options in the action-romcom territory include such efforts as The Bounty Hunter, whos complaining?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Less an evenings entertainment than a glittering bear trap, Stephen Sondheims subversive 1979 Broadway triumph bristled with the composers spikiest dissonances. By the end of the first half, a vengeful serial killer was happily twirling with the woman who baked his victims into meat pies. By curtain, all of London seemed charred by apocalyptic fire: sick with amorality and, its safe to say, indigestion.</p><p>Much of that musical is heresmartly condensed, if slightly less sooty, under the pop-gothic glare of Tim Burton. For that unlikely outcome alone, <i>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</i> merits a nod, and not just from the <i>Saw</i> crowd. (Brace yourself for multiple neck slashings.) As is his want, Burton has cast Johnny Depp, and per the actors usual resourcefulness, Depp has turned Todd into a seething, spitting Hammer horror, more punk than prog. Whereas in <i>Ed Wood,</i> it felt like both collaborators were finally revealing something under the makeup, Todd, with his Sontag shock-stripe, is the peak of their stylized menace. Hes a scream.</p><p>Given the towering stature of the musical, one cant help but wince at errant nicks. Helena Bonham Carter is porcelain and lovely as always, but hardly the brassy presence needed to persuasively draw this monster out of his cage; you dont have to know the classic stage turn by Angela Lansbury to feel somethings slightly out of whack. Sacha Baron Cohen owns his brief comic role as Todds faux-Italian competitor, but where is baddie Alan Rickmans customary fire? Still, Burton does more than just deliver, and even if you wish hed sharpened his instruments a little longer, the shave is bracing.</p><p></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Click here to read our interview with the director of 'Mid-August Lunch'</p><p>Its no secret that many Italian men stay at home with mamma until they get married, or at least until mamma finally kicks them out into the big, bad world. But this low-key Italian charmer, which is more of a touching, humorous short story than a fully fleshed novel, takes that idea to extreme lengths. Writer-director Gianni Di Gregorio (one of the writers on last years Gomorrah, but dont expect any guns here) plays Gianni, a placid Roman in his fifties who lives with his elderly mum Valeria (Valeria De Franciscis), a refined 80 year old who always looks like shes dressed for dinner at the Ritz back in 1963.<br /><br />This loving pair live in a comfortable city-centre apartment, surrounded by good furniture and knickknacks accumulated over many years, but we know they have little cash as the manager of their building comes knocking, wondering when theyre going to pay their service charges. In place of a cheque, Gianni agrees to look after the managers mother for the weekend. However, when the mother, Grazia, turns up, she has another relative, Maria, in tow. Within hours, Gianni has also agreed to take care of Marina, his doctors mother, which means hell be spending the mid-August holiday (ferragosto) in the company of four women with a combined age of around 350.<br /><br />Its a bit of a stretch to call this a comedy, even though it puts a warm grin on your face from beginning to end. The real beauty of the film lies in how Di Gregorio quietly realises the relationships between Gianni and the four women. These ladies might need a bit of looking after, but they still like to talk about boys, eat good food and even, in one case, wander off in the middle of the night for a furtive drink.<br /><br />Underlying this amiable, thoughtful film is an assumption that age should bring with it respect  and however exasperated he gets, Gianni abides by this code completely. Oddly, the film reminded me a little of Curb Your Enthusiasm, partly because Gianni, with his silly domestic horse-trading, comes across as a much kinder incarnation of Larry David and partly because it shares a freewheeling concern for the absurdity of the everyday, such as when Gianni has to buy food from a local fisherman to feed his unexpected guests. But this is very much a real and warm enterprise, not least because Di Gregorio extracts such lovely performances from his elderly cast. A treat.</p><p>Click here to read our interview with the director of 'Mid-August Lunch' <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Grafting crude, borderline-cruel 21st-century humor onto a comedy of manners that pointedly evokes the first decade of the last century is a novel way of getting laughs, so the drug-deranged gay dwarf and profanity-spewing senior citizen in this Frank Oz Britcom have a certain peculiar integrity. The sniveling prat who gets sprayed with the old guys shit, maybe not so much.</p><p>Trashy trappings aside, <i>Death at a Funeral</i> is a pleasant if staid account of a bourgie clan burying one of its own. The funeral party gathers at the home of the deceased, where his feuding adult sons (MacFadyen and Graves), devoted niece (Donovan) and her inadvertently doped fianc (the scene-stealing, frequently naked Alan Tudyk), along with various hangers-onincluding the aforementioned acid casualty (Peter Dinklage) and be-fecesed friend of the family (Andy Nyman)pop the cork on their long-simmering resentments. This makes for pretty thin broth, and most of the films fun is reserved for its final third. But Oz does a decent job of building up to <i>Death</i>s big laughsand even when things go all gooey for the sentimental finale, theres a final gross-out gag pitched to the cheap seats.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Americans take it for granted that, assuming we know four chords (and the truth), we could plausibly become rock stars. The struggling Springsteens and Strokes fanatics in Bahman Ghobadis look at Tehrans termitelike music scene dont have it as easy; the authorities treat anyone with a Stratocaster like a criminal suspect. If youre as lucky as the young singer-songwriter duo Negar (Shaghaghi) and Ashkan (Koshanejad) and get a gig in London, youll have to jump through a series of bureaucratic hoops to play abroad. (That Ashkan is female only adds to the red-tape pileup.) A fast-talking hustler (Behdad) takes them under his wing, introducing them to fellow revolutionaries and helping them buy black-market passports. Meanwhile, the creative suppression continues: We sing underground, laments one Jay-Z wanna-be, [and] the sound wont go past the floor. </p><p>Having previously favored the poetic pastoralism of most modern Iranian cinema (see<i> A Time for Drunken Horses</i>), Ghobadi opts for a funky-urban feel here, allowing viewers a glimpse of the citys regional interpretations of blues, rap, metal and Pitchfork-approved indie rock. The sheer ecstasy of expression in these performances gives the movie a pulse, though the directors abuse of MTV aestheticsquick cuts, skewed angles, generic shots of city lifeturns what should be lyrical interludes into karaoke background videos. These artists are risking everything by playing Western-influenced music; that Ghobadi cheapens and cheeses up their subversion with Hollywood tricks makes for a seriously bitter irony</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An RTE-BBC co-production, this peculiar, often beautiful documentary presents the racing year through the big, brown eyes of three horses  Ardalan, Joncol and Cuan Na Grai  at one of Irelands top stables. Filmmaker Liz Mermins approach is a sort of inversion of March of the Penguins-style anthropomorphism: rather than frame animals behaviour as if they were people, she seeks to portray the horses personalities and experiences on their own terms, with secondary attention to the team of humans who attend them. Its an interesting idea that works to a limited extent but is hobbled by the fact that horses are just not that interesting as subjects  and where they are, its impossible to get more than a superficial appreciation of their thought-world. Cuan Na Grai, for instance, seems to have some kind of mood disorder but while jarring, arrhythmic music might complement his enervated movements, it gets nowhere near unpacking them. Call me anthropocentric, but its the people in this film who make the strongest impression, and their words: one contender, were told, ran like a hairy goat.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Inspired by Mozarts <i>Requiem</i> and commissioned as part of a series of films commemorating the composers 250th birthday, this elegy for an old Kurdish musician determined to perform one last time in his homeland is equal parts road-trip slapstick and human-rights screed, with a dollop of haunting mysticism. Bahman Ghobadis previous work has been similarly eclectic with mixed results, although his eye for imagery is undeniably arresting. The visual poetry works; the comic relief and political harangue, not so much.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Banksy has a weird relationship with fame. Lets call it the reverse Jordan: hes famous for not being famous. He breeds celebrity then rejects it. Just last year he was the subject of an odd film made by the ICAs ex-chairman Ivan Massow called Banksys Coming to Dinner, in which an actor duped Joan Collins into believing she was hosting a dinner party for the street artist. All signs suggest Collins was party to the gag. But was Banksy also in on it? Probably not. But still it fed his notoriety. His anonymity is a handy tease  a tool which allows him to draw attention to himself while at the same time deflecting it.<br />This is the spirit of Exit Through the Gift Shop, a new documentary brought to us by Banksy but not directed by him (the film has no such credit). It profiles Banksy and prods at issues raised by his success, from originality to commercialisation. But its a wonky, sideways profile in that the film pretends not to be about Banksy. He  or whoever made the film  employs a fall guy to make himself look good. Call it passive self-promotion. Some even call it a hoax. But thats missing the point: even if the final section of the film doesnt feel as honest as the earlier parts, theres nothing to suggest that the whole thing is made up (which is different from savvy editing and presentation). Part of the problem is that we expect a Banksy project to be a joke on us. Whatever the film is, its sparky and funny and invigorating to watch.<br />The fall guy  lets call him Banksys mirror  is Thierry Guetta, a hipster French exile in Los Angeles introduced to us from the beginning as obsessed with video cameras and looking for an outlet for a creeping early middle-aged ennui. Essentially the film has two narrators: Rhys Ifans, buoying the story along in voiceover, and Banksy, who pops up occasionally in silhouette to offer commentary. Both lend their voice to a mass of archive footage, much of it shot by Guetta, who, were told, started filming his cousin Invader (the French bloke who plasters mosaics everywhere) in the late 90s and moved on to other artists, including Shepard Fairey and Banksy.<br />Were told that after many years of filming these artists on roofs, at night or in their studios, Guetta edited his footage into a mess called Life Remote Control. Which is where Banksy decided to take over and turn the archive into something watchable. Which is where we join the party.<br />The cheeky twist in the tale is that Guetta, encouraged by Banksy, then becomes an artist too. He exhibits and sells work at a hyped-up Los Angeles show, and all the signs are that Banksy is closer to this late creative flowering than he admits. Most of Guettas works look like D-grade Banksy rip-offs and theres a sense that theres a smart mind behind this bad work, which includes a giant aerosol can labelled with branding for Campbells Tomato Spray.<br />So, whether Guettas burgeoning art career is under the patronage or direction of Banksy  or both  is the question you must take away. Whatever the answer, the film is a rousing tribute to street art, a crafty autobiography and a cheeky comment on the bravado of artists, talented or otherwise, and the gullibility of their punters  us included.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Liam Neeson goes from releasing krakens in <i>Clash of the Titans</i>
to wearing medical Crocs in this semisuccessful horror flick, which
casts the towering performer as Eliot Deacon, a soft-spoken mortician
with the ability to talk to the recently deceased. Its never entirely
confirmed if his very particular set of skills is genuine or the
elaborate cover of a serial killer; suffice it to say that when
schoolteacher Anna Taylor (a necrolicious Christina Ricci) crosses his slab,
theres a lot of impassioned hemming and hawing about whether shes
dead or alive.</p><p>Deacon cleverly talks around the facts of her case
with the kind of mock-philosophical misdirection (Only I can see you
as you really are.) befitting the Saw films Jigsaw. Yet this bogeyman
is different: Neeson clearly relishes the role, but he never plays to
the cheap seats by going whole-hog psychotic. The characters
motivations remain tantalizingly opaque from first frame to last.</p><p>Would
that writer-director Wojtowicz-Vosloo brought the same sense of
tightrope-traversing rigor (minus mortis) to the rest of the film.
Ricci is certainly game, baring body and soul in her scenes with
Neeson. But two subplotsone involving Annas bereaved boyfriend, Paul
(Justin Long), the other one of her death-obsessed studentsact as damaging
narrative deadweight. This is one case where theres more life in the
morgue than out.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The X-Men, Spider-Man and Batman movies have proven that the second instalment is where a comic-book blockbuster series finds its feet: with all those pesky origin details out of the way, the filmmakers can focus on raising the stakes, deepening the characters and ramping up the action. <br />And for the first 45 minutes or so, this is where Iron Man 2 looks to be heading. Director Jon Favreau sets the stage for a titanic three-way conflagration as Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is under investigation by the US government following the public revelation of his superhero persona, while his arch rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) is scrambling after his technology and mysterious, musclebound Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) is up to unspecified no-good.<br />The dialogue crackles, the special effects pop and the onscreen action never flags, climaxing with an astonishing multi-car pileup at the Monaco Grand Prix, where Iron Man meets his nemesis Vanko, aka Whiplash, for the first time. So far, so excellent: Favreau builds on the solid foundations of the first movie, and success looks guaranteed. But slowly, imperceptibly, it all starts to fall apart during the remaining hour or so.<br />A major problem is the number of characters: Downey, Rockwell and Rourke are obviously all enjoying themselves enormously, but the same cant be said for Don Cheadle as Starks redundant buddy-cum-sidekick Rhodes. Nor do the others seem to be having much fun: Gwyneth Paltrow is underused as Stark's assistant-cum-love interest Pepper Potts, while Scarlett Johanssens Natalie is slinky but pointless. The less said about a perfunctory appearance from Samuel L Jackson as some sort of shady inter-agency bigwig the better.<br />As the film plays out, it starts to look likely that all the rumours of reshoots and recuts werent just online rabble-rousing. Characters appear and vanish. Seemingly important plot details surface and are swept away. And this feels increasingly like a film which got lost in the edit. Whereas in the first act we jetted from Siberia to Washington to Monaco, the second half is mostly confined to a series of boardrooms, army bases and laboratories. A flat, studio-bound final showdown takes an age to arrive and is over in minutes.<br />Iron Man 2 is a lot of fun: its shiny, likeable and never boring. But its also wildly uneven and unnecessarily convoluted, leaving the viewer unsatisfied and hungry for something more substantial. Lets hope a promised third instalment can fulfil the series undeniable potential.<br />]]></review>

thats essentially what we have hereafter a laughably amateurish intro
set in the 1920s, when the dice and cards are unearthed (in Turkey).
The friends that assemble on a modern-day Maine island to try it out
are uniformly obnoxious, and only the twin babysitters from Robert
Rodriguezs <i>Planet Terror</i> are recognizable. Soon enough, out
come the black, full-eye contact lenses and rental costumes. The
hi-def-video production looks made by people who havent seen <i>The Room</i>.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The doors of perception are further cleansed in director Tom DiCillos tribute to
the Doors, fronted by the late Jim Morrison. Yet nothing appears
particularly infinite: DiCillo adeptly skewered Indiewood in the
moviemaking satire <i>Living in Oblivion</i> (1995), but his
documentary skills are rudimentary and crude, shaped mostly by his
shallow fandom for the group. The worst dialogue of the year so far
comes from Johnny Depps smarmy narration track: But you cant burn
out, he says of Morrison, if you were never on fire. Stop the
presses, Bill Blake!</p><p>Of course, such pseudo-profundity suits the
Doors. Taken out of context, those lines about lizard kings and monks
buying lunch seem even more like masturbatory grabs at enlightenment;
the bands genius came from the ways Morrison, Ray Manzarek, Robby
Krieger and John Densmore enveloped the words within their own
inimitable sound. They reflected the zeitgeist even as they reached
beyond it. </p><p>The doc is good for illuminating some of the groups
methods (the lack of a bass player was a liberating bit of
happenstance), as well as for showcasing a wide swath of previously
unseen footage from concerts and recording sessions. Morrison
inevitably takes center stage, since his drug-addled personahalf
shaman, half sex addictis the easiest to view with uncritical awe.
Like so many Doors chroniclers, DiCillo cant help but fall under the
singers spell; its understandable, but frustrating.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A disjointed and dreamy evocation of the predominantly antisocial inhabitants of a small Swedish suburb which takes its visual and narrative cues from films like Harmony Korines Gummo and David Gordon Greens George Washington while managing to surpass neither in the interest or originality stakes. The three key characters include a destructive young lad who seems strangely detached from his family and peers, a dim-witted father whose lack of parenting prowess means that he changes his young sons nappy in the middle of a busy car park and old man who quietly fishes using a stick with nails attached to the end. The haunting male-voice choir soundtrack and crisp Steadicam photography lend it a technical cohesion, but as drama it never really takes shape. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>There seems to be an unwritten rule that family films are
mind-numbingly predictable; they traffic in plots and characters so
elemental it would make Joseph Campbell blush. So it goes with <i>A Shine of Rainbows</i>.
Awkward, stuttering lad Tomás (John Bell) is whisked away from a grim
orphanage by smiling, warm-hearted Maire (Connie Nielsen), who takes him to
her rural home on a remote island.</p><p>Alas for Tomás, Maire’s
husband, Alec (Aidan Quinn), isn’t as keen on the adoption. As the film makes
very clear with repeated shots of the unsigned adoption papers, Tomás
has to win over Alec or it’s back to the orphanage.</p><p>We’re not
giving away much by saying Alec isn’t as gruff as he first appears. Nor
is it hard to guess what will happen when Tomás finds an orphaned seal
on the shore.</p><p>Bell should steer clear of roles that involve
stuttering, but once he gets to the crying scenes you can see why he
was cast. And we’ll just warn you that there is plenty of crying. Director Vic Sarin
offers up magical whimsy and weepy moments in equal measure, with Irish
piping for every occasion laid out liberally on the soundtrack. This is
about as subtle as a St. Patrick’s Day parade, but we’ll grant that as
kids’ films go, it’s pretty good.</p>]]></review>

News footage, Internet clippings and interviews with like-minded pundits are all melded together in order to map out corruption in New Jerseys public education system, before the whole shebang arrives at a startlingly simple solution: charter schools. Right! Veteran TV anchor Bob Bowdons feature debut has all the intricate nuance of an evening newscast; its analysis is heavy on diagnosis but simplistic when it comes to the cure, as well as woefully ignorant of racial and fiscal complications.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Youd never guess, until perhaps the final, magnificent trial scene, that Powell and Pressburgers post-war film grew out of the Ministry of Informations desire for a film celebrating British-American relations. RAF pilot Peter Carter (David Niven, below) falls in love with Boston-born radio operator June (Kim Carter) at an unfortunate moment: just as hes plunging to the ground in a burning plane. Its after he hits the ground that the conceit kicks in: colour disappears and were in a black-and-white heaven, where clerks are waiting for Peter  only he got lost in typically English fog and has met up with June and fallen in love. What to do? Especially when a village doctor is prepared to fight Peters case at the highest levels of justice. When the camera pulls back from the celestial court towards the end to reveal an audience of thousands  most of them combatants  Powell and Pressburger apply the weight of six years of war to this loopy love story.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Call it <i>Brokeback Talmud</i>not just for its taboo-busting depiction of a gay affair between Orthodox Israelis, but because it adopts Ang Lees slow-burn seriousness almost to a fault. To his credit, first-time director Tabakman displays more explicit sensuality than Lees cowboys, with perhaps the sexiest scenes ever filmed with Hasidic Jews. But thats strictly between repressed butcher Aaron (Shtrauss, resembling a yarmulked Jake Gyllenhaal) and his wanton apprentice, Ezri (Danker); when Aaron gets home to Rivka (Tinkerbell), the mother of his three kids, their bedroom action has all the excitement of navel lint-picking.</p><p>The film strains under a similar perfunctoriness, leaning on a cheerless, Euro-fest mode of long takes and a moody electronic score. But the low-key observational approach does yield payoffs, like when Aaron gets to know Ezris nature through his vaguely erotic sketches of men from yeshiva school. Theres a terrific sequence in which Aarons peers enlist him to rough up a non-Orthodox man dating an Orthodox girl, as an indirect warning that theyre on to his secret. <i>Eyes Wide Open</i> finally delivers a knockout visual: the lovers meeting seemingly alone, only for a passing cars window to reveal a dozen men monitoring them. The dramas moments of inspiration vindicate its desultory proceedings. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>As consumers become hyperaware ofand more immune toadvertisings effects, the stealth-marketing industry has developed some truly sinister ways to control how we spend our hard-earned wages. Thats the thesis of cowriter-director Derrick Bortes depressing satire, which tracks the titular clan that demands to be kept up with after moving into a McMansion community. The setup is brilliant, even if it doesnt play out so cleverly: The Joneses arent an actual family, but a sleeper cell of ambitious marketeers hired by a mysterious corporationthe golf nut dad (Duchovny) being the most recent recruit. All of the family members are silver-tongued Type As: the fake high-schooler daughter (Heard) imploring her peers to buy the latest cosmetics and diet pills; the son (Ben Hollingsworth) hawking tech gadgets and video games; and Mom (Moore) working her housewife ripple-effect integration at the salon.</p><p>The spot-on cast almost holds the movie together, but whatever potential this timely premise has is wasted on reworking the same gag about overconsumption. Once romance gets in the way of business and one of the conniving Joneses suddenly finds their humanity, its only a matter of time before everything implodes. More discomforting is that real Audis and Dell computers show up among the fake luxuries, which means the jokes really on us: Product placement strikes again! </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ordinary-looking, middle-aged Krister (Olle Sarri) wakes on the bathroom floor, spattered with blood. He washes, dresses and goes to work. Hes irritable, out of sorts, yelling at his clients. The world around him is vague but intrusive  the lights too bright, the noise too loud. He goes to the gym, then drives home. The living room looks like a slaughterhouse.<br /><br />Jesper Ganslandts third feature is a work of psychological observation in the most literal sense: all we can do is watch. Theres no commentary, no judgment and precious little insight, so what were left with is a simple, near-real-time portrait of a taciturn, unreadable man trying to deal with the extremity of his existence. Sarri is phenomenal as Krister, an icy, utterly unpredictable blank canvas. Ganslandt directs with tremendous precision, creating a mood of brooding, implacable threat. But his refusal to dig any deeper into his character results in a compelling but finally (and perhaps intentionally) rather shallow portrait of human behaviour.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her fashion-conscious gal pals are back, and theyre taking the girl-power hi-jinks to a whole new level. First things first, though: the gay, gay, gay wedding of bestest friends Anthony Marantino (Mario Cantone) and Stanford Blatch (Willie Garson), where chorus boys sing Sunrise, Sunset, swans frolic among the guests, and Liza Minnelli officiates. Watching that queerest of queer icons risk her umpteenth hip replacement by performing Beyoncs Single Ladies (dance moves and all!) is as suspenseful as a Hitchcock set-piece, and a difficult act to top.<br />So writer-director Michael Patrick King doesnt even try. Instead, after this camp overture, were plunged headfirst into Carrie and friends familiar mock-troubled paradise: Ms Bradshaws relationship with the debonair Mr Big (Chris Noth) is moving further toward stifling domesticity. Neurotic mother Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is worried her braless live-in nanny has the hots for her hubby. Lawyer Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) quits her job after too many put-downs from her chauvinist boss. And Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is, well, horny as fuck. What a great time to take an all-expenses-paid trip to Abu Dhabi!<br />Taken in hand by this formidable foursome, the big, bad Middle East becomes a menopausal Westerners delight. One wrongheaded jaw-dropper follows another, from Samanthas description of a gay manservant as Paula Abdul to a comic climax in which the ladies escape an angry male mob by wearing hijabs and abayas given to them by like-minded Muslim women. And the featherbrained feminism the franchise specialises in reaches its apex when Carrie files her latest book, I Do. Do I?, beside Susan Sontags Against Interpretation. How do you say, In your dreams, girlfriend in Arabic? <br />]]></review>

In this try-hard New York romcom she plays Zoe, a pet-shop-owner-from-the-block, pushing 40, clock ticking. With not the whiff of a man in sight, she activates plan B: artificial insemination. Then, what do you know, she meets Mr Right (Alex OLoughlin) on her way home from the clinic. Its raining and they jump into the same taxi  it happens all the time in the movies, phoney contrived ones at least.<br />This screams J-Lo comeback vehicle  as you can tell from the casting of Mr Right. Alex who? Apparently hes an Australian actor who has been on the telly (a back-up for John Cusack?). Its a sparkless match. He is meant to be a farmer, which involves a lot of standing around looking hot at a produce market. All the usual rom-com accessories come as standard: sassy BF, calamitous first date, cutesy pet dog (for double-cuteness this one is wheelchair bound).<br /> Actually, the dog is crucial to one of the films best gags: a dog-ate-my-pregnancy-test set- up. Otherwise its money for old rope: gynaecology  speculums, legs akimbo  and pregnancy gags, plus a circa-1976 stereotype of a dippy single-mothers support group. If this is a comeback, lets hope J-Los got something else up her sleeve. Id love to see her ditching the nice-nicey routine and sinking her teeth into a juicy super-bitch.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The latest comic book to get a Hollywood going-over, The Losers, is a growling, paranoid graphic novel about a renegade military unit transformed into a 12-certificate bro-out. And it isnt half bad: unmemorable but fast and flashy, and less bloated than the kind of action number that keeps John Travolta in Lear jets. Plugging into the zeitgeist for films about dark forces pulling strings in government, it opens with the unit  still kosher  carrying out covert black ops. Theyre in Bolivia to do the CIAs (presumably illegal) bidding, taking out a drugs baron.<br /> Only when they arrive, the baron is using children as mules. Their handler, Max  the puppet master  orders them to strike regardless. Refusing, they come under attack from their own side, and presumed dead, disappear off into hiding promising payback. All the usual soldierly suspects are here: motormouth geek, family man, taciturn shooter, the really hard one  played perfectly decently by Chris Evans, Columbus Short, Oscar Jaenada and Idris Elba, with Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the colonel. Theres even a hot chick, Zo Saldana, who handles weapons like a trooper, sometimes in her knickers.<br />The Losers never stretches any of these stereotypes or hazards anything that might confound its audience. When the plot turns  as it inevitably must  to Max amassing a nuclear arsenal, were told he purchased them from the multinational-maker-of-everything. Funny, but its a reminder theres nothing new going on here. All of which might leave fans of the comic hankering for its foul-mouthed fatalism  when the prospect of going after the CIA gave one soldier the squirrelly shits. Here, its more like dude, wheres my AK?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Winner of the 2010 Best Foreign Film Oscar, this decade-hopping, tone-shifting mystery-thriller-romance from Argentina is about as deep as a kiddie pool, which isnt to say its an unpleasant frolic. Separated by time and circumstance, retired criminal-court employee Benjamn Esposito (Darn) and his former-superior-cum-unrequited-love, Irene (Villamil), revisit an unresolved case from years before. Its a lurid little tale of a beautiful woman raped and murdered, a doting husband (Rago) who wanted revenge and a killer (Godino) who went free thanks to the countrys tumultuous political climate. </p><p>Director Juan Jos Campanellawho recently put a butchtastic Kathy Griffin through her paces on <i>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</i>does yeomans work, save for a faux single-take in a packed sports stadium thats clearly devised to impress. The camera swoops in from above, settles among the crowd, and switches points of view with look, Ma, no hands! effortlessness as Esposito chases down a suspect. But its so enamored with its own brilliance that the people get lost in the swirl.</p><p>Not that theres much to these characters to begin with, since they bow to the story mechanics rather than drive them. Everyone is more or less defined by their hairor lack of it. (There are fake baldpates in this film that would make Telly Savalas sue for defamation.) Darn and Villamil make for an attractive couple, no matter what age-aiding prosthetics the makeup department throws at them. And the resolution of the murder plotpart O. Henry, part EC Comicsis an ironic lip-smacker that concludes the mostly rote proceedings on a giddy high note.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Give James Ivory a long-lauded novel (<i>A Room with a View, The Bostonians</i>)or a decent book by a great author (<i>Howards End</i>)and he can deliver an adaptation attuned to period-piece nuances and intricate social codes. Hand this filmmaker a piece of fiction set in the here and now, however, and Ivory seems lost; its as if he needs decades of distance and a canonized voice to bring out his best work. So its no surprise that, even with longtime screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala watching his back, the director never finds his groove with Peter Camerons tale about an academic (Metwally) who encounters problems while writing a biography of a late literary celebrity. The loved ones wont consent; after this would-be Boswell treks down to the family compound in Uruguay, he gets caught up in the lives of the authors wife (Linney), mistress (Gainsbourg) and brother (Hopkins).</p><p>The impeccably photographed landscapes and highbrow talk of the filmmakers tony dramas are here. (You probably just read criticism, barks Hopkins, the Ivory equivalent of an Oh, snap!) But the emotional pull of his classic screen translations is completely MIA, and not even Linney and Hopkins engaging in a thespian-off livens things up. Finality, schminality; its like being stuck in a remote way station, awaiting better things.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Never mind how inconceivable it is that busy Rainer Werner Fassbinder took time between his two crowning provocations, <i>The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant </i>(1972) and <i>Ali: Fear Eats the Soul </i>(1974), to make a three-and-a-half-hour sci-fi sizzler for German TV. (He also wrote several episodes of a blue-collar labor drama and directed an Ibsen play.) Let’s just be thankful he did. World on a Wire is the discovery of the season, rarely screened in America but very much a key chapter in Fassbinder’s story—a step toward bigger budgets and slicker production values, yet clarifying of his core artistic legacy.</p><p>Fashionable nerds will compare the knotty tale—essentially about a supercomputer that creates a virtual reality—to <i>Avatar,</i> but the vibe here is closer to those cryptic, blue-ish mysteries that David Cronenberg used to make in Canada with people running around in lab coats. (Yes, that equals awesome.) A scientist (Löwitsch) hopes to get to the bottom of it, tugging dangerously at the fraying edge of what he thinks is reality. Fassbinder, adapting freely from Daniel F. Galouye’s deeply influential 1964 novel <i>Simulacron-3, </i>finds his usual themes in the genre material, notably social and sexual exploitation. But a chase or two certainly don’t hurt.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Aiming to both approximate and steadily subvert 70s backslapping guys films like John Cassavetess <i>Husbands,</i> director Bette Gordons coming-out tale casts rugged-mug character actor Jamey Sheridan as Harry, a poker-faced electrician whos forced to reckon with his past. After an old Navy buddy (Buscemi) begs for atonement from his death bed, Harry reaches out to other bygone pals, hoping to make sense of an act of homophobic violence perpetrated more than 30 years ago. Who cast the first stone at their gay comrade? And who, pray tell, <i>actually</i> dropped the soap? </p><p>Gordon (<i>Variety</i>) and screenwriter Nicholas Proferes couch their gender studies in forced aggression and slangy guy talk: being male means constantly calling each other pussies, self-medicating with saloon shots and punctuating conversations with punches to the face. We became men together, one character says. It must count for something. Unfortunately, Gordon asks that notion to count for everything without adding much to the conversation. Harrys haunted by his own identity crisis, but that breakdown translates into nothing but smeary, slo-mo flashbacks. Forget about insight into the macho mind-set; such shorthand tricks are only there to manufacture a false sense of suspenseand help avoid the real drama of what happens after the truth comes out.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Although based on the real-life tale of nine underage underdogs from Monterrey, Mexico who swept the 1957 Little League World Series, this Cinderella sports story rings false from first pitch to last. Boys cant just be boys herethey need to be pint-size saints, keeping the faith and crusading against racism. With God fully on <i>our</i> sidethe Christian sermonizing leans heavily on vague, theologically dubious suggestions of divine baseball providencetheres not even a swing-and-a-miss threat to the preordained outcome.</p><p> Recently fired MLB janitor Cesar (Collins) retreats south of the border to booze, scowl and don a wife-beater, until a kid named Angel (!) strong-arms him into coaching the towns fledgling ball team. Along with the local priest (Marin), Cesar shepherds them to the promised landsotherwise known as Texas and Kentuckyand then to the championship, where the film belabors its namesake. Director William Dear, apparent king of baseball devotionals (<i>Angels in the Outfield, The Sandlot 3</i>), betrays no understanding or respect for how the game is actually played: He harps on home-run money shots in which balls limply fly as if they were being controlled by string, remote control or the ghost of Ed Wood. <i>The Perfect Game</i> courts its target demos like a leg-humping hound, but sports fans, believers, Latinos and even young wanna-be Willie Mayses can find fellowship elsewhere.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Pornography: A Thriller </i>may have a few interesting things to say about porn. But thrills? Not so much. What begins as an ambitious, segmented meditation on a missing gay-porn star (Grey) and the journey of one writer (Montgomery) into a violent, voyeuristic heart of darkness eventually devolves into a routine Lynchian head trip. The long, strange trip of another stud-for-hire (Scherer) experiencing haunted dreams completes the narrative three-way. Taken independently, these chapters probe the thorny porn starviewer exchange, but Kittredge cant connect the dots into a worthy climax. In other words: all foreplay, no full release.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its a sign of the bankability and confidence of Far Eastern cinema that directors such as Kim Jee-Woon and Takashi Miike, having excelled in homegrown genres, have begun to expand into traditionally Western areas: musicals, melodramas, satire.<br />For his third film, Kim has taken this literally, fashioning a film which corrals all the motifs of the spaghetti western  horses, pistols, train robberies, sweat and betrayal  and uproots them to early twentieth-century Manchuria.<br />Its a rewarding strategy. As the title suggests, the film borrows liberally from Sergio Leones masterpiece, as the eponymous mismatched bandits attempt to outwit one another  not to mention the Japanese army and the bloodthirsty Ghost Market Gang  and gain possession of a legendary treasure map. Hardly the most groundbreaking setup, but its in fusing western clich with Eastern style that Kim triumphs: this is a film where the cowboys wear silk-embroidered jackets and practice kung fu, where the soundtrack spins Morricone to an electro beat.<br />A certain superficiality is perhaps unavoidable: despite some nice character touches and a striking political denouement, Kim lacks Leones understanding and his sense of historical scale. But what he lacks in empathy Kim makes up for in cinematic sophistication, in fluid, dizzying camera moves and judicious CGI, ravishing set design and exhilarating action. This is filmmaking as rodeo ride: bruising and ultimately pointless, but thrilling as hell while it lasts.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Its a no-brainer why this crowd-pleasing romantic thriller, the latest example of suicide-bomber cinema, was nominated for seven Israeli Academy Awards. It allows audiences to congratulate themselves for acknowledging deep-seated complexities without the burden of actually grappling with them. </p><p>Driven to Tel Aviv and armed with a vest full of dynamite, Tarek (Jabarin), a young Palestinian Arab has explicit orders to martyr himself in the Carmel Market. But when the bustling Saturday morning arrives, his trigger button malfunctions. His antsy handlers can remotely spark him up via cell phone, but Tarek convinces them to hold off while he gets one of his enemiesa kindly old electrician named Katz (Vishinsky)to unwittingly repair his detonator. Running the kiosk across the street is Keren (Yalon), an Orthodox-raised beauty who is ostracized for her dyed hair and tight clothing. Suddenly, theres a love connection, while the clock silently ticks down. Oh, the tragic irony of it all.</p><p>Too on-the-nose to resonate past the end credits, this slickly produced film still deserves praise for being progressive-minded, as Tarek isnt a hateful man but a product of his circumstances who is only trying to help his family. Its frustrating to see such a humane movie suffer from oversimplification.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A clever satire on Londons art scene? What a treat. But no  what we get with this slick, shallow and flesh-adoring adaptation of Danny Moynihans NYC-set novel, transposed to London, is a limp series of caricatures, hysterical scenes and an overloaded plot that suggest its makers cared more about packing the frame with names than getting the characters and comedy just right. And what names: Danny Huston, Gillian Anderson, Heather Graham, Alan Cumming, Christopher Lee, Amanda Seyfried, Stellan Skarsgrd, Jaime Winstone and Simon McBurney all appear. Its a giggle at times. Huston is louche as a Jay Jopling-like art dealer trying to get his hands on a Mondrian; Anderson amuses as a scene-obsessed collector; and Cumming is shrill as a wannabe curator-manager rejected by a self-obsessed video artist (Winstone) once she finds success. But well-connected, first-time feature director Duncan Ward (his wife is a top curator) throws too much mud too fondly for any to stick. Art world aficionados will have a jolly time identifying the characters and tut-tutting. Others will just tut-tut.]]></review>

As before, the setting is a deceased family patriarchs services, which are spearheaded by the dutiful oldest son (Rock) and his hotshot-author younger brother (Lawrence); all manner of romantic, sibling-rivalry and cross-generational wackiness ensues, mostly of the strained <i>Threes Company</i> variety.</p><p>Nude, hallucinogen-fueled jaunts on rooftops, revelations about same-sex relationshipswith a little person, no lessand individuals covered in feces are all executed with verve by the typically misanthropic Neil LaBute. Its his formidable cast (which also includes Luke Wilson, Peter Dinklage, James Marsden and Danny Glover) that really keep things moving, though their ability to generate postmortem yuks by brute comedic force never quite compensates for the middling slapstick nature of the high jinks and an over-reliance on easy poop and gay-panic gags. Still, this Death laps the original, laugh-wise, and is LaButes second-funniest film to date, trailing only his unintentionally amusing, WTF cover-version of <i>The Wicker Man.</i></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>One is tempted to throw away any semblance of persuasion and simply <i>demand</i> that you go see this movie. Without <i>His Girl Friday</i>, there is no sexy, Tarantino-esque banter (maybe no banter, period; speed limits are flagrantly violated). On a more personal note, this is a movie that makes journalism seem like the most exciting profession in the world: a job that involves daily flirtations, card playing, smoking, phoning it in (both figuratively and literally) and the strong possibility of hooking up with either Svengali editor Cary Grant or ace reporter and former doll-faced hick Rosalind Russell.</p><p>Never were two wits so perfectly entwined, and lets tip a fedora to screenwriter Charles Lederers sparkling bons mots, adapted from the 1928 stage play <i>The Front Page.</i> But the real genius here is director Howard Hawks, who, with the casual insouciance he became known for, liked the way cocky Hildy Johnson sounded when the part came out of his female secretarys mouthso he made the role for a woman. We have to be careful not to ascribe any further politics to the man. But out of such decisions, careers have been born. Its a film that makes you want to sharpen your barbs and sling sass with the adults.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Following on the heels of his impressive, more recent war movie, Assembly, this dazzlingly designed, mega-budget, period costumer offers further proof of Fengs increasing versatility, expansive vision and bravura technique. But, although it isnt derivative exactly  unless you count its plots magpie borrowings from Shakespeares tragedies, notably Hamlet  it does seem to weaken and enervate itself within its individually impressive but collectively suffocating sequences of high art, balletic pageant, classically inspired performances and flying, CGI-assisted daggers.<br />Its right, too, that it has been given a family audience-denying certificate; not just, it must be said, for swishing scenes of head-severing, blood-spurting, ritualised violence, which alternate rhythmically with the sloth-slow court intrigue: theyre stylised out of all meaningful offence or shock. Rather, younger viewers may have been bemused by the air of suppressed eroticism that suffuses its episodes of poisonous romantic intrigue. Emperor knows how to pleasure a woman, says Ziyi Zhangs porcelain beauty, the widowed Tang dynasty empress being massaged by her brother-in-law, the new emperor and her ex-husbands assassin. <br />Daniel Wu injects a more dynamic thrust as the returned prince, the new empresss supposed true love and fellow swordmaster, and brings relief with him as the movie mutates into a more orthodox, martial arts-inflected, revenge tragedy played out finally at the elaborate banquet organised for the 100th day of the emperors reign. But overall The Banquet is too drawn-out, lacking the originality and sprightliness those such as Zhang Yimou and Ang Lee brought to similar fare, and overly conspicuous in its designs on the approval of the international art movie audience.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p><i>Killing Kasztner</i> is a case when a films basic material may
be too intractable and thorny to make a satisfying feature-length
documentary. The subject is Rezso (a.k.a. Rudolf) Kasztner, a Hungarian
Jewish lawyer who at the beginning of the Nazi occupation of Budapest
managed to arrange negotiations with Adolf Eichmannsaving nearly 1,700
Jews by paying by the head. This was either heroism or an unspeakable
act of collaborationKasztners detractors suggest that he failed to
warn the Jews he left behindand director Gaylen Ross lays out the matters lasting
political implications in Israel, where Kasztner settled after the war
and where his name is still regarded mostly with suspicion. He was
assassinated in 1957 by a right-wing extremist group.</p><p>Delving into everything from Israeli government documents to Kasztners representation in Holocaust museums, <i>Killing Kasztner</i>
is pitched at wildly varied levels of detail, and it somehow plays as
simultaneously thorough and diffuse. Its clear Rosss sympathies lie
with Kasztners daughter and her children, who have been forced into
defending a man the film argues was essentially the Jewish Schindler.
Rosss biggest coup is to arrange a meeting between Kasztners family
and his convicted assassin, who implies from his first scene that he
wont be a completely reliable witness. The alternation of sentiment
and dry testimony results in a frustrating and scattered film, but its
hard to imagine how <i>Killing Kasztner</i> could have been anything else.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In Wes Cravens 1984 original, Nancy warned her boyfriend Glen, a young Johnny Depp: Whatever happens, dont fall asleep. Heed this warning if you see this tedious reimagining of Cravens seminal slasher movie, because youll be struggling to stay awake. Inheriting Freddy Kruegers iconic fedora and striped sweater from Robert Englund, former child star Jackie Earle Haley makes what he can of a hand-me-down role, slicing his way into the dreams of suburban teenagers. That said, Haleys CGI-enhanced make-up makes more of an impression than his weak presence, scary voice or lame one-liners.<br /><br />After their friend is killed by an invisible attacker, emo girl Nancy (Rooney Mara) and misfit Quentin (Kyle Gallner) are convinced that her death is connected to a nightmare theyve all been having and a dark Freddy Krueger-related secret their parents have kept from them  a secret the kids have all, in a convenient act of collective amnesia, repressed since nursery school. Now Freddy is back, invading their dreams and threatening to kill them in their sleep.<br /><br />The makers clearly couldnt decide between a prequel or remake, so they and first-time director Samuel Bayer have jammed both together. Heather Langenkamps wimpy portrayal of Nancy was the originals weak point, and here Maras Nancy slips between the somnambulant and the catatonic. This is the worst yet from Michael Bays horror production company Platinum Dunes, which also brought you rubbish re-makes of Halloween and Friday the 13th.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Three has always been a magic number for South Koreas Hong Sang-soo: This is a director who loves, loves, <i>loves</i> an emotionally messy mnage  trois. So its no surprise to see another romantic trio forming at the beginning of Hongs latest, or that this bitter comedy is located squarely in his thematic comfort zone. Anyone lucky enough to have caught any of Hongs previous work knows that Director Kim (Kim Seung-woo), a filmmaker, will make a play for the attractive girlfriend (Ko) of his underling (Kim Tae-woo). Per usual, psychological pole-positioning takes place over socially awkward, alcohol-fueled dinners, and the male of the speciesself-centered, oversexed and borderline infantilegets soundly skewered. But there are some good ones out there, right? asks Kim after his conquest declares that Korean guys are the pits. Her sad smile speaks volumes.</p><p>Newcomers intoxicated by Hongs amorous pileups and power plays will hopefully treat the movie as the gateway to an incredible back catalog. But by the time the protagonist introduces another female into the mix, <i>Woman on the Beach</i> will elicit a Havent we seen this before? from the converted. The familiarity of the proceedings doesnt necessarily breed contempt, as the directors ability to nail narcissistic immaturity still yields rewards. When a potential third love triangle turns into a false alarm at the end, however, the broken cycle signals that one battered romantic is ready to move on. Its a lesson the director may want to take to heart. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The extraordinarily dextrous woodland creatures in this live actioner are not about to sit back while Brendan Frasers real-estate developer Dan Sanders bulldozes their habitat into obliteration, so they set out to make his life hell. Dan brushes off his first altercation with a poorly rendered CGI raccoon as a weird coincidence, but when his nights are disturbed by a magpie tapping on his display homes window and his car is zapped by skunks, he begins to suspect the animals have it in for him. And so it continues, until he snaps, war is waged and eco-conscious repentance and reconciliation beckon.<br />Fuzzy elements of Chuck Joness unruly style are evident in some of the more amusing scenes and Frasers not overly incompetent as the butt of so much schadenfreude. But, strewth, did they have to pad it out with so many repeated pratfalls and inconsequential guff? It should play well enough with the under tens, mind.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>This doc profiles 90-year-old dance artist (and Winnetka native)
Anna Halprin after a wave of renewed interest in her work that began in
Europe about five years ago. While this isnt exactly a hagiography,
numerous cuts point to friction in her creative partnershipsmost
notably with John Graham and A. A. Leathwithout following up. The end
result is a standard-issue dance film that suggests drama only to demur
on grounds of maintaining the sanctity of its subject. (Halprins
daughter Daria remembers longing to be like the so-called normal kids
in 1960 while we see Graham prancing around with the then-ten-year-old
high over his head. She recalls discomfort with the riskiness of the
performance but, tellingly, her mother doesnt comment, and Anna and
Daria never appear in the same frame.)</p><p>Director Ruedi Gerber offsets his
timidity with a treasure trove of archival material. Merce Cunningham
is captured on film during a West Coast homecoming, and a montage of
clips from <i>Ceremony of UsRight On!</i> (1968) offers a
fascinating close-up on experimental community healing in the wake of
the Watts riots. Halprins conflicted relationship with the dance world
is increasingly pushed to the foreground, as it apparently has been in
life; the earthbound story of Bay Area modern dance that ran
perpendicular to New York formalism is the true subject here, and
Halprin is, more than anyone else, its author.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Undeterred by the lacklustre Shrek the Third, the series returns for a fourth film  and this time, its gone sci-fi. Shrek ends up in a parallel universe after tiring of the monotony of both fatherhood and local celebrity. In his current life, no one is scared of him, and busloads of tourists peer at the swamp home he shares with wife Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and their cute green babies. So Shrek goes awol and bumps into a wandering little guy called Rumpelstiltstkin.<br />As fairy-tale fans will know, Rumpelstiltskin specialises in tricksy contracts. So when Shrek drunkenly signs an agreement to be a real ogre for a day in return for just one day of his life, he doesnt realise the catch. Suddenly, Shrek is thrown into a world in which ogres are hated, but Rumpel rules the kingdom, hosting all-day raves with black-clad witches and routinely scamming the quivering inhabitants of a depleted Far Far Away.<br />All very Back to the Future II, and its a fun twist that allows for a fresh perspective on familiar characters. Fiona is now a warrior princess, Donkey is a slave to the witches, and Puss? Well, lets just say hes been living the good life. The plots initially involving  and if its too complex for toddlers, it compensates with humour, visual invention and a 3D wow factor. This cant match the originals laugh count, though, and the story wears thin. Still, with warmth and charm, Shrek Forever After is an entertaining conclusion to the franchise  one that parents should happily endure. But lets hope thats all, folks.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>A wise man once proclaimed that love means never having to say youre sorry. Had this sage ever seen Max Ophlss work, he would have recanted that nugget of bumper-sticker wisdom immediately. A filmmaker whose entire oeuvre treated lamour as one bitter, looped apology, Ophls made romantic movies for closet cynics. Viewers can become so enthralled with his rich, cluttered compositions and graceful tracking shots that they almost miss the hearts that inevitably shatter before their eyes. BAM is devoting three weeks of programming to the German-born directors thrillers and tearjerkers; thats assuming, naturally, that folks can regain their composure enough to return after seeing his 1948 melodrama, which has been known to turn grown men into human puddles.</p><p>The crowning achievement of Ophlss tenure in America, <i>Letter from an Unknown Woman</i> is as close to perfection as Hollywood weepies have ever come; in terms of the filmmakers own personal best, its only a hairs breadth behind <i>The Earrings of Madame de</i> (1953). Were it not for him, this love triangle between an obsessed young woman (Fontaine), a callow musician (Jourdan) and the cruel hand of fate might have been just another elegant period piece shuffled off the Dream Factorys assembly line. But Ophls understands irony enough to show how temporarily requited passion makes everything seem magical, yet true happiness is as illusory as an amusement park coach ride. You never forget that youre in the hands of a master: Every moment is measured, every step is counted and every heartstring is plucked with the utmost care.</p>]]></review>

So its a sweet surprise that this long-awaited Hollywood version has lightness in mind.</p><p>Paced swiftly by ex-<i>Swinger </i>Jon Favreau, the movie is blessed by motormouthed Robert Downey Jr. as billionaire tech genius Tony Stark, an apolitical man with stripper poles on his private plane. Much was made of this risky casting, but it pays off beautifully. Downey, already a walking comic strip, imparts crucial verve to Favreaus static compositions; his glib Stark, launching smart bombs between sips of Scotch and busting out of Afghan terrorist captivity with a half-amused shrug, is dangerously appealing in a P.J. ORourke way.</p><p>Of course, <i>Iron Man </i>becomes about Starks reawakening: Struck by conscience, he closes his arms factoryand for a giddy moment, you wonder if a studio movie might be taking on the whole of the military-industrial complex. (The overgrown MIT geek then weaponizes his body in a sequence of tests as fun as anything in <i>RoboCop.</i>) But here, actually, is the sole problem with the film: Suddenly, its too conventional. It doesnt take a rocket scientist to correctly identify Jeff Bridgess bald coexec as the Halliburtonian antagonist-to-be.</p><p>But <i>Iron Man </i>is one blockbuster that cant end with a typical mano a mano slugfest, no matter how roboticized and <i>Transformers-</i>like. We want planes, tanks, enraged Congressional speeches. Such is the promise of the character that you feel like the franchise will get there. (Many hints are planted.)

      <review><![CDATA[I ended up feeling a bit sorry for Michael Caine by the time this hateful vigilante flick set in modern-day London came to a close. Did the old boy know what he was getting into? The funny thing is that Harry Brown, bar a violent prologue, begins fairly soberly, even reflectively, as if the makers were thinking more of All or Nothing than Death Wish. Harry (Caine, below) is a widower who shuffles around a crumbling housing estate with only fellow army vet Leonard (David Bradley) for company. But life changes when Leonard falls prey to the hoodies who linger in the local underpass. When distraught Harry gets short shrift from the police (badly written, and poorly played by Emily Mortimer and Charlie Creed-Miles), he decides to take the law into his own hands and drives this already wobbly wagon straight into hysterical genre territory. By now, all you can do is sigh, laugh and try not to get upset at the stupidity of it all.<br />Although it takes a while before Harry Brown shows its true colours, therea a vulgar whiff from the off: in the first seconds of this debut from director Daniel Barber (who, technically, shows a fair amount of talent) we watch grainy mobile footage of a kid on a scooter as he confronts a young mum and shoots her dead before he comes a cropper himself on the road. Its horrible stuff, but there must be a good reason for it, surely?<br />As it turns out, this scene is a random first glimpse of a warped portrait of our city thats straight out of the Daily Mail  a place where your granny might get shot, stabbed or battered at every turn. Its also the first hint of the sick ideology of the film, in which ill-informed pessimism is bolstered by childish ideas of revenge. Theres always a punishment around the corner, not only to avenge bad behaviour but also to give the makers sneaky licence to indulge in violence. As narrative  and moral  maths go, this is a cooking of the books that sidesteps any smart commentary on real life.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>To really know what the ocean is, you have to see it for yourself,
intones Pierce Brosnan at the beginning of Disneys latest nature doc.
Taking in the films light-dappled deep-sea footage may be the next
best thing, even if the ex-Bond-smans ponderous narration hardly
facilitates a closer understanding of the life aquatic. Still, the
films rigorous commitment to probing the undersea kingdoms oddities
separates it from the usual tepid Discovery Channel fare, and those
looking for marine exotica and savagery will thrill to a sea slug that
shimmies like a flamenco dancer and an orgiastic feeding frenzy
involving dolphins, sharks and a school of sardines.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>It should go without saying that when Jean-Louis Trintignant props a large steel bazooka between himself and Romy Schneider, theres more than one rocket hes thinking of launching. Yet when this image comes early in <i>Le combat dans lle, </i>it feels surprisingly chaste, flaccid and bloodless, a middlebrow symbol of transgression that fits in with the worst tendencies of this rediscovered films producer, Louis Malle. </p><p>Malle reportedly took on <i>Le combat</i>with his former assistant, Alain Cavalier, directingas a rebuke to the mostly right-wing <i>Cahiers du cinma</i> crowd (Godard, Rohmer et al.), specifically their support of the French occupation of Algeria. Yet this early 60s love triangle between an intense political extremist (Trintignant), his stir-crazy wife (Schneider) and a hunky pacifist printer (Serre) is less a potent work of dissidence than a childish schoolyard rivalry heavy on the Nanny nanny poo poo!</p><p><i>Le combat</i> remains a watchable curio due to the three leads and the nouvelle vague gloss given to it by expert cinematographer Pierre Lhomme, but this only heightens the sense of disappointment when it becomes apparent that a wide gulf separates the genre machinations from the larger meanings. Ah, well. It sure looks purty. <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Since Bergmans death in July, New York has mounted several touching tributes to the great Swede, including a revival of <i>Monika</i> and screenings of <i>Persona</i> (introduced by none other than Bibi Andersson) and <i>Shame.</i> The IFC Centers premiere of the five-hour version of <i>Fanny and Alexander</i> (which the director far preferred to the three-hour cut released in theaters) may be the most moving homage yet.</p><p>The saga of the Ekdahl family, spanning approximately 19071908, famously contains several Bergman biographical elements (a severe patriarch) and a summation of lifelong themes (the struggle to believe in God). What will strike both Bergman acolytes and neophytes most in this almost-farewell to cinema (2003s <i>Saraband</i> would be his coda) is the incredibly detailed, compassionate view of childhood. Children had rarely figured into Bergmans oeuvre prior to <i>Fanny and Alexander,</i> functioning primarily, if at all, as portents of the bizarre: One thinks of the sickly, bespectacled boy in <i>Persona</i> and the odd lad who meets the dwarves in <i>The Silence.</i></p><p>This film might be considered the year of magical thinking for ten-year-old Alexander (the amazing, spindly-limbed Guve). Clearly the directors surrogate, Alexander, the son of actors, is first seen playing with a toy theater, whose motto reads Not for pleasure alone. He, along with his younger sister (Allwin), will soon be thrust from the never-ending delights of a warm extended family into the horrors of an unbearably severe second home. Our young protagonist will be obsessed with death and see ghosts everywhere. Never has the prison of childhood seemed so inescapable.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Give <i>Sleep Dealer,</i> Alex Riveras indie sci-fi parable, the credit it deserves. A limited budget appears to have been spent on fleshing out serious ideas, not shiny suits. Subcutaneous nodes (yuck) allow impoverished Mexicans to port into a different realitythe kind that works them to the bone operating robots in remote high-tech factories. One such exploited soul is Memo (Pea), who begins the film as an amateur hacker working in a scrub-surrounded shed, then sees his home bombed by drone attack planes (and memorialized on the Cops-like TV hit <i>Drones</i>). Soon, he meets a femme fatale (Varela) on the way to Tijuana, who takes him to the next level.</p><p>Its all chewy stuff, and the occasional flash of humor (a militarily guarded water supply that sucks up $20 bills at the access point) is redemptive. But when your lead actor makes The <i>Matrix</i>s Keanu Reeves seem animated, certain synapses arent firing. Economics are, indeed, the proper purview of science fiction, from <i>Metropolis</i>s class-stratified cities on. But gripey dystopian concepts do not a complete movie make. Riveras film won the same award at Sundance that Shane Carruths heady Primer did in 2004a cash prize that honors technological concepts. Hopefully, both directors will use the money to take some drama courses. </p>]]></review>

coo awww, a baby when a stroller passes by with a cute infant in tow?
If so, run, dont walk, to this documentary. If not, you might be bored
stiff. That being said, this film, which follows four infantsin
Mongolia, San Francisco, Namibia and Tokyofrom first breath to first
steps, is so darn adorable it has a lulling effect that will mellow
even the most vehement baby haters. </p><p>The movie is the brainchild
of Alain Chabat, but its French director Thomas Balmes who soars,
manipulating his footage in such a way that both the universal and the
culturally specific elements of these babies upbringings are keenly
felt. Though youll feel a range of emotionshock when the camera zooms
in on a live birth scene, laughter when one infant tries to escape a
hippie, eco-baby class, pounding on the doors to get outsadness is not
in this documentarys vocabulary. All the babies plod along to the
soundtrack of Sufjan Stevenss The Perpetual Self, all giggles,
adorableness and discovery. Its infectious; youll walk out of the
theater feeling happy to be human, wishing you could go out and buy a
baby, or at least borrow one for a little while. Then youll look at
your watch and not believe you spent the past 79 minutes watching
babies crawl aroundand didnt mind at all.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The Manchurian Candidate raises the same red flags today as it did in the early 1960s, when its story of political intrigue and assassination became all too relevant following the death of JFK, causing the films abrupt disappearance from screens. Re-released to coincide with the current election campaign, it remains a nightmarish tale of high-level subterfuge, mental manipulation and the futility of one mans rebellion against an ingrained social system. <br />In one of his last roles as a genuine actor before he was swallowed by shallow fame, Frank Sinatra stars as disturbed Korean war veteran Bennett Marco, who uncovers a plot to murder a presidential frontrunner. One of the first films to voice the growing belief that the American system of power and privilege was corrupt, it prefigures not just the Kennedy and King murders, but Vietnam, Watergate and the entire 70s conspiracy boom. More importantly, its a sensational piece of genre filmmaking: pacy, compelling, witty and cynical, it depicts, in unflinching detail, the beginning of the end for post-war American optimism.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>For his first English-language film, Icelander Dagur Kri appears to be
under the spell of Jim Jarmusch and Charles Bukowski, with tips on
elevated diction from Damon Runyon. Irascible crank Jacques (Brian Cox) owns
the dingiest dive bar you've ever seen, where an eccentric crew of
regulars (a florist, a garbage-truck driver, a would-be novelist)
huddle and shoot the shit when Jacques isn't berating them in florid
language or temporarily banning them from the premises.</p><p>But
Jacques has a bad heart condition (symbolic title alert!) and worries
about passing on his legacy. So he takes in suicidal, homeless Lucas
(Paul Dano), who is such a blank slate that he wouldnt register at all if
it werent for Danos aggressive use of awkward postures to convey
character. (Honestly, at times it looks as if hes going to pull a
muscle from acting so hard.) Cox, meanwhile, is going for shabby
grandiloquent misanthropy, and plays every curmudgeonly grimace to the
balcony seats. Jacques tries to remake Lucas in his own bitter image,
but a flight attendant with a fear of flying (Isild Le Besco) disrupts their
equilibrium. </p><p>Quirk and sentimentality battle for supremacy, and
all thats missing to make this a perfect throwback to the worst
indulgences of early 90s indie cinema is a theremin in the score.
Instead we get tinny piano and some cellos. Close enough.</p>]]></review>

Shot on poor-quality Camcorder tape (complete with on-screen icons), Korine shoots himself, his wife and a couple of pals, all of them unrecognisable in face masks (probably the films greatest expense) which make them look like elderly folk, as they run amok, mostly at night, in the grotty backstreets and houses of a grim-looking American suburb. They hump trees and bins, meet weird locals and get involved in disturbing rituals. By the end, I admired its daring and its relentlessness  but was also running for the door.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Documentaries can be the victims of bad timing, and thats to some extent the case with <i>Floored</i>,
which chronicles the plight of veteran Chicago futures traders as they
struggle to adapt to new, fast-paced computer technologies. Smith has
had the interesting idea to examine a sliver of the financial sector
thats struggling with obsolescence (as opposed to whining about
slightly less oversized bonuses), and the interviewees range from fat
cats to burnouts. But of course floor trading is essentially gambling
for a living, and every other industry on earth is in crisis too. At
times this myopic, incomplete-feeling portraitwhich ends in September
2008plays like special pleading.</p><p>Its not fun unless you can
die, recalls former trader Mike Walsh, remembering the time he was
rhino hunting in Africa. That sort of bluster makes many of these
subjects less than sympathetic, but the movie takes pains to counteract
perceived audience antipathy: It notes that several of the traders
dont even have college backgrounds, and it repeatedly emphasizes the
integrity of Chicagos pit, ostensibly the last exchange floor on
earth where traders are man enough to shove and spit at each other.
Like much of the economy itself, those shows of pride were illusory.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>This film almost demands our highest rating on sheer stature alone. But theres an important realization to make about Fritz Lang: His movies only get better after <i>Metropolis</i>. Four years later, he would release <i>M</i>, the beginning of the modern serial-killer film and still a procedural with no equal. Fleeing to America in 1934, Lang managed to smuggle cynicism into Hollywood while somehow retaining his signature grandeur (and prickly on-set demeanor). <i>Fury</i>, his 1936 U.S. debut, is a shocking indictment of mob rule, with Spencer Tracys best performance. <i>The Big Heat</i> is the noir to end all noirs, even outwilding Wilder with its sudden-death coolness.</p><p> </p><p>So back we go to these bustling future cityscapes and Brigitte Helms sexy robot, knowing that without them, there is no <i>Blade Runner</i>. Lang at his best, however, is about more than the wow factor, and this movies crude class warfare (workers tend to the machines underground; rulers live in high towers) is hardly profound. <i>Metropolis</i> is superspectacle, essential to understanding how movies can function primarily on craft and atmosphere. (In this sense, it shares a lot with Tod Brownings mythical megaproduction <i>Dracula</i>, from 1931.) The design is impeccable and still a touchstone of steamy modernism; newbies will recognize not only Madonnas Express Yourself video but also <i>300</i>s Spartans in these graphic hordes of charging men. The visionary Tower of Babel sequence remains a high point: a perfect minimovie in the larger context and a hint of Langs deeper mistrust of humankind. His greater provocations were yet to come; heres a textbook example of how to set yourself up for the bigger dare.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>From very early in <i>The Square</i>, its clear that things are
not going to go well for Raymond (David Roberts), a building contractor whos
carrying on an affair with Carla (Claire van der Boom), a younger woman who
lives across a shark-infested bay. Its just simple plot economy; you
dont make reference to shark-infested bays without said sharks getting
to dine. Without spoiling things, well note that screenwriters Joel
Edgerton (the directors brother) and Matthew Dabner know the rules,
and know how to tweak them a bit. That makes <i>The Square</i> an enjoyable take on very familiar film-noir ideas.</p><p>When
Carla learns her husband, Greg (Anthony Hayes), is hiding a big bag of money
(definitely of the ill-gotten variety) in the house, she persuades
Raymond to steal the money, burn down the house to cover the crime and
run away together. Even without a <i>Double Indemnity</i>style
voiceover, you know this plan is going to go wrong, but its still fun
trying to figure out precisely how things will go wrong. Filmmaker Nash Edgerton
plays things straight and simple, without any fancy directorial
flourishes or attempts to pay homage to other films. Hes built a
simple mousetrap, not some baroque twisty contraption, but its a
clever mousetrap, and it suffices to catch the mouse.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[By now, youll know that Ken Loachs new film stars Eric Cantona as the imaginary mentor of a Manchester postman who suffers panic attacks and cant cope with his two mouthy stepsons. Its a playful but never gimmicky set-up that turns hero worship on its head, as the cool-headed Cantona appears in the life of scruffy Eric Bishop (Steve Evets) to tell him in that familiar sagely mumble to pull himself together and reconnect with his pals. Oh, and Cantona takes him for a jog, shares Bishops spliffs and shows off his own, limited, trumpeting skills.<br />The pair swap tips on how to cope with the dark times and reminisce over Cantonas goals, cueing several stirring montages of balls hitting the back of the net. Eric might tire a little of the Frenchmans gnomic advice (Im still getting over the seagulls one!), but an amusing, touching friendship emerges that slowly nudges a suicidal man back towards the solidarity of the workplace and the terraces  a fading solidarity that the film both celebrates and laments.<br />But there are two, not one, intimate, winning relationships at the heart of this film  one imagined, the other real. Theres the rapport between postie and ex-footballer, and theres the softly-softly reconciliation of Eric Bishop and his ex-wife Lily (Stephanie Bishop), a woman he hasnt seen for 20 years after their youthful marriage turned sour. They meet cautiously, initially for practical reasons as they share the childcare of their granddaughter, but later they begin to inquire into each others lives and try to work out what went wrong many years before. Their scenes together are the films highlights, and both Evets and Bishop  neither of whom have had such demanding acting roles before  give honest and warm performances.<br />The beauty of Loachs film is that both these relationships feel equally relevant to Erics life and Loachs examination of it. The winning power of Looking for Eric lies in this meeting of the magic and the mundane. Its mainly a film about men  men who fail themselves, like Eric, and men who fail society, like the hoodlums we see tempting Erics sons into crime in the films less successful climactic storyline, which involves angry dogs, kidnapping, YouTube and gunplay, and feels a little out of place after the films quiet tte--tte. But then Loach and his writer Paul Laverty are nostalgists for lost causes, and this is their chance to grieve again for the changing world of work. <br />Their last film, Its a Free World, mourned a more moral approach to employment; here they mourn the lack of opportunities for Erics sons. But Looking for Eric is more of a cheerful wake than a funeral. Football might be corporate, Eric might be going gaga, teenage boys might be all adrift, but what win out are humour, love, friendship and the support of your mates. Its a Loach film all right  with added optimism and laughs.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Too often during artist Shirin Neshats first film for cinema  co-directed by fellow artist Shoja Azari, also born in Iran and resident in America  I felt I was looking at and admiring it rather than engaging with it on the level of emotions or ideas. Neshat draws on Shahrnush Parsipurs novel of the same name to tell the experience of four women  prostitute Zarin (Orsi Toth), middle-aged bourgeoise Fakhri (Arita Shahrzad), single 30 year old Munis (Shabnam Tolouei, pictured) and her friend Faezeh (Pegah Ferydoni)  during the 1953, CIA-backed coup which overthrew the democratic government and returned the Shah to power. Its a beautiful package, not least because of astounding photography by Martin Gschlecht (Lourdes), but it feels like a triumph of art direction and lighting over its attempt to reflect the experience of Iranian women during the time its set and, by implication, today. The mixture of realism and poetry, the literary and the visual, is awkward and the only character whose experience resonates is Zarin, mainly because of Toths possessed performance.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[From the director of "Gladiator"! scream the posters, and youd be forgiven for expecting a straight rerun of that Oscar-winning hit - a film that swaps togas and short swords for Lincoln green and feathered arrows. But this Robin Hood is a more unpredictable beast: while the shakycam action sequences, effete young villain and moody presence of Russell Crowe hark back to the earlier film, this is far closer to Scotts ambitious but unloved Kingdom of Heaven in its depiction of a world ruled by brute force and striving for moral direction.<br />The opening act could even work as a sequel to that film: fighting his way back from the Crusades in the army of Richard the Lionheart, archer Robin Longstride decides to head for home when the King gets an arrow in the neck. By a series of unbelievable coincidences, Robin finds himself posing as deceased nobleman Robert Locksley, charged with taking news of the Lionhearts death back to his troublesome brother, the new King John (Oscar Isaac).<br />This kickstarts the long series of subterfuges, political dirty deals and full-scale treachery that constitute the films wildly convoluted story. It's plots aplenty: King John plots against his former Chancellor, Marshall (a stately William Hurt); traitor Godfrey (Mark Strong) plots against John, Robin and the entire English nation in concert with the devious King Philip of France; while Maid Marian (Cate Blanchett) and her ailing father-in-law (Max von Sydow) plot to keep Robin in Nottingham in the guise of the former Lord Locksley.<br />Confused? You will be. Anyone expecting a straightforward woodland beat-em-up will be bemused and most likely dismayed by the intricacies of the narrative, particularly when it becomes clear that Scott has been forced to trim back the action to fit in all these dastardly goings-on. Add a complete absence of characterisation, some laughable accents (Crowe sounds like hes auditioning for Coronation Street) and a sense of history that would make Simon Schama scream, and youve got the makings of what should be a tedious, overblown disaster.<br />But for all his faults, Scott knows what hes doing. The film looks terrific: the English landscape hasnt looked so lush and magical for a long time, particularly in a clutch of gorgeous moonlit night scenes. Aesthetically it's convincing, which goes a long way towards offsetting the more nutty convolutions in the plot. And while characterisation has been cut to the bone, Crowe, Blanchett, Strong and especially Von Sydow remain eminently watchable, with strong, likeable support from the likes of Mark Addy as Friar Tuck and Matthew MacFadyen as a marvellously greasy Sheriff of Nottingham.<br />Best of all, the film just feels huge: genuinely epic in a way few movies have since Lord of the Rings. The endless plot twists may be perplexing, but they work to make the movie feel eventful and involving: after 140 minutes, audiences will feel like theyve been somewhere, lived through something. And so, while this Robin Hood is a long way from perfect, it remains a satisfyingly immense and old fashioned grand-canvas experience.]]></review>

The chief problem is the story's utter predictability, although the score and choreography (with the single exception of 'Something's Got to Give') are also uninspired. Shot to no apparent advantage in 'Scope, this is Hollywood escapism at its most mediocre.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Proof that not all films derived from Stephen King's books need be intellectually banal and cinematically dull. Romero's movie centres on Thad Beaumont (Hutton), a small-town author and creative-writing tutor, who, threatened with exposure, decides to kill off his literary doppelgnger, crime novelist George Stark. Soon afterwards, Thad's friends and colleagues start meeting violent deaths, apparently at the hands of the late Stark. Thad's wife Liz (Madigan) is frightened for the children, but although the local lawman (Rooker) is sympathetic, he refuses to believe that Thad's fictional alter ego is the razor wielding culprit. It's a strong conceit, but precisely how it's linked to a feather-brained subplot about the black-outs and aural hallucinations Thad suffered as a child remains obscure. This one-paced psychological horror movie delivers its share of visual shocks, but relies mainly on a controlled build-up of tension.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It might be more interesting to watch this Tarantino/Rodriguez film without knowing what's in store, in which case, skip this review and take your chances. But don't come running back to me if double-barrelled schizophrenic gun-crazy gut-shot evangelical sleaze, incendiary, popcorn-blowing macho mayhem, slinky, soul-searching zombie strippers, and vampiric cult-infested cinemania don't light your pipe. Tarantino and Clooney are the Gecko brothers, sick and ruthless killers, respectively. They commandeer the motor home of the Rev Fuller (Keitel) to evade the cops en route to a midnight rendezvous at the Titty Twister, hottest whorehouse in all Mexico. Along for the ride are Fuller's teen kids, and the Reverend himself, who has most definitely picked the wrong day to lose his faith. Written by Tarantino in 1990 on a commission from a special effects company, the film is aimed squarely at (male) horror movie fans who appreciate the nuances of impalement by pool cue, pencil and table leg. Rodriguez has a lot of fun dreaming up cool ways to kill people (he's making this his life's work), but he also gets something resembling a performance from Tarantino and transforms Clooney into a full-fledged movie star. Bikers, head-bangers and film geeks will rave to the grave.]]></review>

Quite what Jean Renoir made of his regular art director's switch to monster-movie auteur (<i>The Colossus of New York</i>, <i>The Giant Behemoth</i> and <i>Gorgo </i>followed) isn't recorded, but Louri was merely one of a long line of designers to turn sci-fi director, alongside the likes of Harry Horner (<i>Red Planet Mars</i>), Nathan Juran (<i>Attack of the 50 Foot Woman</i>), and William Cameron Menzies (<i>Invaders from Mars</i>).

This musical avoids sensitive issues like the clap, settling for stock tarts-with-hearts, loyal regulars, virginal jocks, and an outraged clean-up-the-state prude (DeLuise) of monstrously miscamped proportions. Clumsy chorus-lining, a penchant for ostrich plumes, and a tinny musical sameness betray the film's stage origins. One good number: Durning's Governor tripping a neat political 'Sidestep'.

This is a typically eccentric, slow moving comedy of manners with the director himself as (again) an erudite, lecherous sophist, here given to taking leisurely bus rides around Lisbon and interviewing young lovelies about coming to clean his flat. It all gets even weirder as the film proceeds to an unexpectedly moving final hour - but be warned: Monteiro's not for those who like their movies lucid.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA['I waanntt myy caaakkkeee!' gurgles the decaying birthday revenant of the first segment of this well-dressed and frequently beautifully framed tribute to the graveyard hoots of Bill Gaines's EC horror comics, complete with links in the original cartoon style. Sadly, the combined talents of King and Romero fail to sustain the opener's deft mesh of blood-letting and black humour. King himself is excellent as a bumpkin with fungus-from-space problems, but the other stories - a watery re-run of <i>Cask of Amontillado</i>, EG Marshall as a Howard Hughes type overrun by cockroaches during a power failure, etc - are simply too long for anybody's comfort. The old Amicus movies used EC originals to better effect and with more brevity, for all their cardboard sets.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Before he fell victim to the debilitating Hollywood law that demands comedy star vehicles be written by committee, Zieff showed in <i>Slither</i> and <i>Hollywood Cowboy</i> a real flair for enhancing off-the-wall fun material. But <i>Private Benjamin</i>, concocted by no less than three scribes from a collective semi-consciousness bounded by re-runs of <i>MASH</i> and <i>No Time for Sergeants</i>, lodges gracelessly alongside <i>House Calls</i> and <i>The Main Event</i> as an anonymous chore for its director. Another depressing example of the big-screen gag-string sitcom, it turns exclusively on a plot that grew from a concept that developed from an idea that somebody should never have had - Goldie Hawn joins the army.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Moving away from the apocalyptic horror of his 'Living Dead' trilogy, Romero reaffirms his equal aptitude for controlled chills, previously evident in <i>Martin</i>. Paralysed in a road accident, Allan Mann (Beghe) is provided with a trained Capuchin monkey, Ella, as home help. A research specimen before training, Ella had been injected with human brain tissue by Allan's mad scientist pal (Pankow) in the hope of increasing her learning ability. Now, as a result of a mysterious mind-meld, Ella responds to Allan's moods, violently enacting his frustrated rage against his bossy nurse (Forrest), fussing mother (Van Patten) and ex-fiance (Turner), in nocturnal rampages which he experiences as hallucinatory nightmares seen through the monkey's eyes. Things build to a nasty climax when Allan falls in love with Ella's trainer Melanie (McNeil), triggering a violently jealous reaction from Ella. What sets this apart from most modern horror movies, besides a sparing use of special effects, is Romero's careful development of a credible emotional context for the pyromaniac madness and razor-wielding terror. Romero's is a formidable talent which others can only hope to ape.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Why did the fans turn late-nite screenings of this cult favourite into an elaborate ritual of dressing-up, singing along, throwing rice and waving cigarette lighters? Well, for one thing, the material inspires affection, given its knowing pastiche of everything from Universal horrors to '50s grade-Z sci-fi, and a shamelessly hedonistic, fiercely independent sensibility that must have seemed a welcome relief from the mainstream bombast of other '70s musicals (not exactly <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i>, is it?). However, dare we suggest that the whole participation angle evolved to boost a movie that is something of an enthusiastic shambles, and collapses altogether in the final reel? Fresh-faced Sarandon and Bostwick are the all-American honeymooners who wind up in the tender care of Tim Curry's camper-than-thou Transylvanian transvestite, O'Brien's hunchback butler and sundry kinky cronies. A string of hummable songs gives it momentum, Gray's admirably straight-faced narrator holds it together, and a run on black lingerie takes care of almost everything else.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An experience so vacuous it's almost frightening. Built around a threadbare Hollywood fairytale which has Newton-John (on roller-skates) playing a muse despatched by Zeus to help mortals realise their fantasies, it turns out in fact to be an unashamed show-case for Livvy's multifarious 'talents'. Alas, as the film grinds from one epic production routine to another, it becomes painfully clear that she can't deliver a line (the script, full of gnomic punchlines, is admittedly abysmal), hold a note (the Jeff Lynne/John Farrar songs are lowest common denominator), or step a pas de deux (despite the helping hand of Gene Kelly, who can still cut it on the dance floor). Not even Michael Beck, fresh out of <i>The Warriors</i>, can salvage the disaster.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Nail your TV to the floor and lock up your daughters: the message here - run away from home, live in a derelict warehouse, and you too can become a cult heroine - is an appealingly romantic one, and there's a fair sprinkling of magic dust to help the fairytale along. Streetwise Nicky (Johnson), elder of two runaways, metamorphoses from scruffy, disturbed urchin to punk-chic Jagger clone, venting her anger as lead singer of the Blondells. Sheltered Pamela (Alvarado), rich and introverted, breaks out and forces an overbearing parent to see her as she is, not as he wants her to be. It's a world where a black plastic bag is a fashion garment, where a TV-smashing campaign is a serious social statement, where teenage runaways in New York do not fall prey to pushers and pimps, where a jaded disc jockey (Curry) promotes their cause. Socially irresponsible and refreshingly optimistic: a <i>Wizard of Oz</i> for the '80s.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Alcoholic scriptwriter Ben (Cage) is blowing his options. Our first glimpse sees his beyond-niceties collaring of an agent friend in a smart restaurant to demand drink money, a symptomatic preamble to what's staring him in the face: a 'sadly, we have to let you go' dismissal from his studio job. Figgis sets the crap game running here: the pay-off finances a one-way ticket to oblivion or, to give hell its name, Las Vegas, city of permanent after-hours. Cash the cheque, burn the past, take the freeway - we're in the booze movie, that most fascinatingly flawed form of the modern urban tragedy. This modestly budget masterpiece pools the Vegas streets with reflected neon and watches Ben drown. Shue is good as the young hooker he falls for, but Cage is extraordinary, producing an Oscar-winning performance of edgy, utterly convincing suicidal auto-destruct. In fact, Figgis makes of him something of an existential saint, a man for whom terminal self-knowledge leads to a kind of grace. If the film lacks the depth and structural sophistication of, say,<i> The Lost Weekend </i>(it was shot fast, with Declan Quinn's saturated Super-16 photography blown up, which may explain its kinetic buzz), it certainly has the courage of its convictions.]]></review>

agrees to wed the studio's irritatingly ditsy secretary (Preston), who's not 
savvy enough to realize that the speedy marriage is a hoax. When Guy starts 
working in a dumbed-down screen adaptation of a novel about labor unions, the 
book's author, socially conscious beefcake Rick Foster (Greer), becomes an 
unlikely love interest for the superficial cad. Richard Day's McCarthy-era 
satire clumsily alternates between campy frivolity and weighty subtext.

      <review><![CDATA[Hands up who ever thought theyd see the director of Four Weddings and a Funeral making a Jerry Bruckheimer movie  and a video game adaptation to boot? As with his instalment in the Harry Potter saga, Mike Newell was clearly brought in to add a touch of dramatic gravitas to this flimsiest of summer blockbusters. Its a strategy which pays off  but only just.<br />The plot feels cobbled together from myriad sources: a pinch of The Thief of Baghdad, a smattering of The Mummy and a hefty dollop of The Thousand and One Nights. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Dastan, a one-time street urchin (natch) elevated to Persian Princeling by the generosity of good King Sharaman. But when Dastan goes against his two brothers and their scheming uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley, whose moustache is just too short to twirl malevolently), hes framed for the kings murder and flees into the desert with only his camel and a bad-tempered princess (Gemma Arterton) for company. <br />As this synopsis suggests, Newell and his screenwriters leave no historical fantasy clich unmolested, and thats before we get to the mystical dagger, the supernatural assassins and Alfred Molina as a jolly, morally dubious gambler. The story does feel overfamiliar and suffers from a lack of dramatic tension as a consequence. Matters arent helped by shoddy CGI and some seriously silly last-act developments.<br />But Newell keeps things moving at a lick, barely allowing his actors a pause for breath between bouts of knockabout banter before chucking them into another athletic action scene. And Gyllenhaal is good value, his natural vulnerability working to offset some slightly alarming action-hero abs. Prince of Persia wont linger long in the memory  but then it probably wasnt meant to.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[After Hot Shots!, Austin Powers and Team America, is there still mileage in the slapstick action-movie pastiche? Based on a recurring Saturday Night Live sketch  itself inspired by 80s cheeseball spy show MacGyver  MacGruber sees SNL stalwart Will Fortes titular secret agent rousted from a jungle retreat and pressed into CIA service in an effort to track down Val Kilmers nuclear-warhead-wielding terrorist, Dieter von Cunth. That name typifies the kind of humour on offer: amusing enough the first time, but increasingly unfunny on the thirty-third. There are a handful of quality gags  most of them at the expense of mullet-man MacGrubers Clarksonesque fashion sense  and Forte surrounds himself with solid performers, notably Kilmer as the preening psychopath and Powers Boothe as a grouchy CIA bigwig. <br />But it all feels terribly routine, and as the script attempts to paper over the gaps between good gags with graphic sex, extreme violence and pratfalls, it becomes clear that this particular well has run bone dry.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Out of the shadows of Mamma Mia! creeps this hysterically silly, sun-soaked yarn of love lost and found in Italy with a story that feels like its been scribbled on the side of a jar of Ragu and an approach to filming Italy thats been nicked from an old Cornetto ad. Sophie (Amanda Seyfried; yes, this wants to be Mamma Mia! without songs) is a lowly fact-checker at The New Yorker who takes a pre-wedding trip to Verona with her restaurateur boyfriend Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal, smiling and waving his hands about like a nutter). But, once in Europe, Gael is off snouting for truffles and Sophie is left to discover a cadre of writers who ritually reply to notes left at the citys shrine to Shakespeares Juliet. Soon, Sophie is penning one such note herself to Claire (Vanessa Redgrave, distinguished amid the nonsense), an elderly Brit whose letter to an Italian sweetheart has been sitting behind a brick for decades. And what do you know? Claire turns up to search the Italian countryside with Sophie for her long-lost Lorenzo  along with her grumpy hunk of a grandson, Charlie (Christopher Egan, actually Australian, which explains why he acts like a surfboard).<br />Is there any point wondering why some of these actors ignored the script and agreed to spend several weeks working in the glorious Italian countryside? But thank heavens for small mercies: someone must have realised in the edit that they might have a kitsch classic on their hands as theres at least a knowing sense of camp alongside the dire performances and corny plotting.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Writer/director Nicole Holofceners sharp talky comedies can seem neither fish nor fowl: too Woody Allen for chick flick, too earthy for arthouse. Its true of her latest, Please Give, which has Catherine Keener as retro furniture dealer Kate, who sells mid-twentieth-century classics out of her Manhattan shop. We buy it from the children of dead people, says her husband (Oliver Platt) sarcastically. Theyve also just bought the flat next door from neighbour Andra (Ann Morgan Guilbert), a cantankerous nonagenarian, with the proviso that she stays put until she dies. Rebecca Hall plays Andras grandaughter, a mammogram technician, and the film opens with a bouncy montage of boobs being slapped down on her X-ray machine.<br />Kate is a character recognisable from Holofceners previous films (Lovely &amp; Amazing, Friends with Money): shes wracked with the frustrations only money and a New Yorker subscription can buy. She feels like a vulture circling Andra waiting for her to die and shes guilty about the extortionate mark-ups in her shop. So she dishes out $20 notes to homeless men and in some ruthlessly hilarious scenes takes up volunteering  a group of kids with Downs syndrome playing basketball reduce her to a pathetic flood of tears.<br />With smug neediness on this scale, Holofceners biggest ally against nauseating self-pity is Keener, her screen alter ego  shes appeared in all four of her films. Keener does messy contradictions like no other actress; she is also, of course, the 50 year old every woman wants to grow up to be. Holofceners writing is unnervingly observant. When it looks like Kates husband is chasing after Andras other grandaughter (Amanda Peet), another writer would play him as a sleaze or her as a man-eater. Here its more banal, a shoddy affair of convenience; realistic, just like those X-rayed boobs.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Having cut his fangs on tween revenger ‘Hard Candy’ and inventive bloodsucker ‘30 Days of Night’, could director David Slade kick off a ‘Harry Potter’-like reinvigoration of the ‘Twilight’ series? Well, sort of: ‘Eclipse’ is a step up from the painfully anaemic ‘New Moon’, and it’s clearly the work of a filmmaker keen to put his own stamp on the series. But Slade is constrained at every turn by the sheer, crushing lifelessness of author Stephenie Meyer’s material.<br />‘Eclipse’ barely advances the story at all: we’re still stuck in the town of Forks, where moody heroine Bella  (Kristen Stewart) is forced to choose between undead love-of-her-life Edward (Robert Pattinson) and musclebound werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner). There are lots of other characters – silly names are dropped with dizzying regularity – but none of them actually seem to do very much.<br />Slade directs with  flair: his action sequences, though small in scale, have real drive, and a series of surprisingly grim Civil War flashbacks enable him to utilise a different visual palette from the usual drab greens and greys.<br /><br />But he can’t disguise the massive flaws inherent in the screenplay: the slipshod plotting, whiny, self-serious tone and excruciating abstinence-first subplot. The biggest problem remains the characters: neither Slade nor Stewart are capable of turning manipulative whinger Bella  into anything more than a joyless black hole sucking the life from every scene, while the only performer capable of giving her part any spark, Anna Kendrick, is completely sidelined this time around. Strictly for Twihards.]]></review>

There's a simple story about lovers from different tribes, and Welch grunts beautifully clad only in a few bits of bunny fur, but the real stars are Ray Harryhausen's superbly animated dinosaurs. It was Hammer's biggest box-office hit and inaugurated a cycle, but the more cheaply made sequels were no match for the ferocious reptile fights on display here.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Haneke's adaptation of a novel by Elfriede Jelinek may be shot, edited and performed rather more conventionally than most of his work, but in many ways it's no less confrontational or transgressive than, say, <i>The Seventh Continent</i> or <i>Funny Games</i>. If the latter was a chaste but provocative variation on the violent thriller, this puts the porn movie through much the same paces, refusing to provide explicit titillation even as it explores the psychopathology of a professor of music, touching 40 but still so oppressed by her tyrannical mother, with whom she still lives, and by the disciplines of her vocation, that her only acquaintance with emotion and eroticism comes from watching porn. Then, into her sad life comes a young student, who falls for her. No conventional redemption ensues, as the pair slide slowly but inexorably into a relationship so painfully twisted it would be implausible, were it not for Haneke's rigorous intelligence and Huppert's controlled and courageous performance. Ambitious, profoundly articulate, and despite its avoidance of sentimentality and sermonising, very compassionate.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An analytical account of the State of the (Soviet) Union at a crucial transitional stage, this is one of the most seminal and therefore controversial films in the history of cinema. Vertov's exhilarating and often hilarious exploration of the relations between cinema, actuality and history opened up all the issues Godard, the avant-gardes, and political film-makers have been wrestling with ever since. The film cannot easily be slotted into any single tradition, because it poses all the questions about the status of representation which dominant cinema represses. A truly radical and liberating work.]]></review>

As always, it is the performances that dominate, with their sensitively-felt, naturalistic speech patterns and gestures; and for all its optimism, the film is still centred around a core of loneliness, while Cassavetes also contrasts the difficulties of real life with the idealised glamour purveyed by Hollywood (an attack on the system that could barely accommodate him?). The result is an understated and intimate view of two unexceptional people that is only sentimental when the characters themselves are sentimental.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
Heir to the throne of Hindustan, Prince Salim (Dilip Kumar) has matured from a decadent only child into a victorious warrior who writes poetry in his own blood. When he falls for beautiful court dancer Anarkali (Madhubala), it provokes the ire of his father, Mogul emperor Akbar (Prithviraj Kapoor), and a conflict of family loyalties escalates into full-blown battle. The story is introduced and concluded by a booming voice-over representing Hindustan itself: a land divulging its legends. Theatrical production design extravagantly offsets scenes of swashbuckling and genuinely sensual courtship. Meanwhile, the characters' dialogue is deeply florid throughout. The film was shot mainly in b/w, but at two points suddenly shifts into a bejewelled colour that adds a dreamlike charm to the lithe choreography and Naushad's magnificent classical score. At over three hours, and an alleged 17 years in the making, this is an undeniably heavy-going concoction - but the feast of intricate sounds and visuals make it one to savour.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Although not quite as prominent a cycle race as the Tour de France, the Paris-Roubaix is, nevertheless, no less gruelling. The final stage is especially arduous: a narrow, cobbled roadway more suited to mountain bikes than highly tuned racers. Not for nothing has this section been dubbed 'L'Enfer du Nord' (Hell of the North). This documentary on the 1976 event is especially fascinating as it focuses on the tussle between three of the greatest road racers of the period: Eddie Merckx, the Miguel Indurain of his day; his chief rival and three-times winner, Roger de Vlaeminck; and Freddy Maertens, the predominant rider at that time. There's no comfort zone here: in the wet, it's muddy and miserable; in the dry, as in this particularly drought-ridden year, the bikes and support vehicles kick up huge clouds of lung-filling dust. Despite a few lagging moments, the film is most notable for its honest, home-movie structure and its informative, old-fashioned commentary.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Avant-garde filmmaker and Anthology Film Archives founder Jonas Mekas has spent his career chronicling the potent bits of life that he calls the concentrate, compiling decades worth of such debris that hes shot on 16mm and, more recently, on video. This visual diary from the early 1970s is one of his greatest efforts, capturing the directors first trip back to his rural hometown of Semeniskiai, Lithuania, after a quarter century in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.<br />While not consistent, Mekas elevates banal smiles and quotidian gesticulations into a singular poignancy. Craftsmanship plays no small part, as the filmmaker knows how to use strobelike in-camera editing, wild sound, pensive narration and emotional music cues for maximum effect. Some moments seem pretentious (he literally and figuratively drinks deep from the hometown well) and too obscure or self-indulgent (long montages of unidentified or barely mentioned friends and family). </p><p>Yet epiphanies still encapsulate his alienation as a displaced person, an immigrant in his new country with no place in the Old World. Seen from todays vantage, everything from this vintage home movie seems especially elegiac; the octogenarian mother he captured almost 40 years ago has now been surpassed in age by her son. Reality TV is junk food in comparison to this nourishing feast of human experience.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The Rock, of course, is Alcatraz, prison-turned-tourist site, which is seized by disgruntled, decorated-to-hell General Harris with his elite corps (psycho captain, loyal colonel); they take 83 hostages and aim four VX-gas missiles at San Francisco; the rockets will be fired unless pensions are provided for the families of dead, 'deniable' Special Forces. The twist here is getting Navy SEALS <i>into</i> the rock to take the bastards <i>out. </i>Step forward as team-leaders reluctant heroes Cage, a Beatles-lovin' FBI boffin with chemical-weapons badges, and ex-SAS officer Sean Connery, the only man to escape from Alcatraz, and presently serving 30-odd years for obtaining US government secrets. Director Michael Bay (with only <i>Bad Boys</i> to his name) propels this brew of combat war-movie, <i>Die Hard</i>-style actioner and <i>Indiana Jones</i> adventure on enough octane to leave objections to the clichd dialogue and implausible of the plot in the slipstream. Fake countdown and knowing reactionary tone, but the best SF car chase to date.]]></review>

His job is to hunt the fugitives, but one day outside the bubble he discovers 'new' emotions with Jenny Agutter. The lavish production has some good effects sequences, but its plot is as corny as the dreadful lurex drape costumes and Jerry Goldsmith's slushy score. Fundamentally, this is just further proof of Hollywood's untiring ability to reduce all science fiction to its most feeble stereotypes.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A collection of puckish, improvised vignettes, this experimental film works best 
as an obliquely satirical window on Beat counterculture, embodied by the 
loose-limbed Mead wandering through smoky clubs and lofts in his cloak of ironic 
whimsy. Some of his friends' rants make it onto the cruddy-sounding audio track 
("Peruvian civilization on coca...America on Coca-Cola!"). Other skits bound 
into slapstick, without the rigor that the casual viewer might require. For the 
historically curious, however, Mead's feature-length riff captures a 
freewheeling moment in full.

      <review><![CDATA[Unlike its cockney equivalent, the Irish gangster movie  however hackneyed its storyline  can usually be relied upon to deliver a modicum of wit and flair. Perriers Bounty is a prime example: it marries a predictable plot  Cillian Murphy owes money to some bad fellas, complications ensue  with a goodly portion of smart banter, off-kilter characterisation and knockabout violence.<br />The film is flawlessly cast, with Murphys put-upon hero ably backed by Jim Broadbent as his world-weary Pa and Jodie Whitaker as the emotionally compromised woman in his life, while a monstrous, towering Brendan Gleeson lords over proceedings as the titular crime bigwig. They bring a sense of playfulness and pathos to the project that probably wasnt there in the busy, amateurish script, stuffed as it is with twists, switchbacks and gangland clichs. Ian Fitzgibbons direction is a little flat and uninspiring and the urban photography is unnecessarily gritty and downbeat. But despite these setbacks, Perriers Bounty is still a pleasure to watch: not exactly memorable, but packed with enough intellect, incident and strong performances to justify the investment.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
These were the days when Allen was still a comedian who happened to make films, rather than the comic film-maker he became. (Don't believe it? Then read film editor Ralph Rosenblum's account of the film's chaotic creation in the cutting-room, in his book <i>When the Shooting Stops</i>). The movie is therefore little more than a series of shrewd but disjointed anecdotes dealing with Allen's usual self-obsessive hang-ups and fashionable metropolitan pastimes: existential dread, masturbation, coke-sniffing, movie-going, psychoanalysis, etc. The one-liners are razor-sharp, the observations of Manhattanite manners as keen as mustard, and some of the romantic stuff even quite touching. If you can forgive the fact that it's a ragbag of half-digested intellectual ideas dressed up with trendy intellectual references, you should have a good laugh.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A surprise summer hit in the States, this is another film-making-by-numbers exercise in teenage wish-fulfilment. A Jewish divorce moves to California from New Jersey, and her son, a male Carrie called Daniel, has terrible trouble fitting in with West Coast ways. His first incipient romance runs foul of the girl's ex, a blond thug who trains at the local karate dojo run by a deranged Vietnam veteran. Fortunately his E.T. comes along in the form of an elderly Okinawan karate master, who not only becomes his special, secret friend but also handily teaches him persistence, inner strength, moral values and karate - which lead him into an apotheosis worthy of <i>Rocky</i>. This is actually director Avildsen's first hit since <i>Rocky</i>, and it has the same mixture of calculation and apparent navet. It borrows its formula from both East and West with good humour, and is completely free of intelligence, discrimination and originality. No wonder it was a hit.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Despite the fancy of-the-moment talk about genetic manipulation, cloning and whatnot, theres a strangely retro vibe to <i>Splice</i>.
With unidentifiable urban and rural locations (a.k.a. Canada), moments
of sexual perversity and the mad scientists play God and get their
comeuppance plot, its like a flashback to early David Cronenberg,
only done by a lesser director who doesnt quite know how to pull off
the creepy effects hes striving for.</p><p>As husband-and-wife
geneticists Clive and Elsa, Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley seem equally unsure what
to do with their roles. Theyve been creating new creatures using
manipulated animal DNA in hopes of harvesting miracle drugs. When a big
show-and-tell for the stockholders goes horribly awry, it looks as if
theyll lose funding. Elsa, a modern-day Eve luring Clive into
temptation, persuades him to continue their experiments in secret using
human DNA. What could go wrong?</p><p>The resulting creature, Dren (Abigail Chu and later Delphine Chanac), matures and learns at an alarming rate, and pretty soon its like <i>The Day of the Dolphin</i> crossed with <i>Its Alive</i>,
only with a twisted sexual vibe. And, as this relies more and more
heavily on conventional horror moves, everyone is forced to act like
the dumb slasher-movie teenagers who wander into the woods to have sex.
There are some really creepy moments, but director Vincenzo Natali doesnt push the
perversity hard enough to take it into the deep twistedness that
Cronenberg exploits so effectively.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Like Ricky Gervais before him, Russell Brand is in his Hollywood honeymoon period: the man can just turn up, be himself and the camera will love him. The question of what happens if  like Ricky  it turns out he can only play one increasingly tiresome role is irrelevant: for now, we can all just rejoice in the fact that one of Londons most divisive, idiosyncratic oddballs has scaled the heights of Tinseltown superstardom  reserving, of course, the right to point and jeer at him on the way back down.<br />A British audiences enjoyment of Get Him to the Greek will depend entirely on their Brand tolerance: those already sick of his incessant self-love and florid Victorian dandyisms should steer clear. Although Jonah Hill as the long-suffering record exec tasked with delivering Russells rock legend to the titular LA theatre may be the putative frontman, this is Brands movie all the way: hes the one snorting the drugs, throwing the tantrums and getting the lions share of the laughs.<br />And the laughs are big: coupling the preening Britrock clichs of Spinal Tap with the edgy darkness of yuppie nightmare movies like Scorseses After Hours, the film has a manic, propulsive intensity that culminates in a series of excessive and hilarious comic setpieces. That it also has a big soft heart will come as no surprise to followers of the modern American man-com, though Get Him to the Greek delivers a surprisingly raw, thoughtful and gender-sensitive take on the obligatory aw-shucks ending. For now, Russells rep seems secure.]]></review>

Perry doesn't help, with his credit sequence tease withholding our first glimpse of the stellar visage, and his determination to pose 'Joan' in geometrical symmetry with the lines of her spotless deco domestic mausoleum. Really no dafter, perhaps, than some of Joanie's own Warner Bros melodramas; the trouble is, it thinks it's Art.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The real progenitor of this musical celebrating the rock'n'roll '50s, had it not fudged some of the less adequate dance numbers by shooting above the knees, would be <i>West Side Story</i>. Otherwise, the film aspires to some of the pretensions of <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i>, from which it borrows liberally while saddled with the liabilities of its dumb stage musical script. Its flashy opportunism (nostalgia pitched squarely at an audience too young to even recall the era) quickly becomes very irritating. Allusions to french letters and high school pregnancies, and double entendres allowed by the hindsight of this more 'permissive' society, scarcely conceal the fact that <i>Grease</i> is even more simplistic (and finally reactionary) than the beach blanket movies of the era. Lots of colour, movement, surface glitter, only one decent song (the title track sung by Frankie Valli).]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A homage to Hollywood screwball comedy that by and large gets its pace and cartoon/slapstick timings right, this began life with a call from Bogdanovich (hot from the Hawksian <i>Last Picture Show</i>) to screenwriting team Robert Benton and David Newman (even hotter from <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i>): 'I've got a deal with Streisand and O'Neal, and no script. I want to do a remake of <i>Bringing Up Baby</i>, and we can do it just like that'. A remake it's not, but the spirit of Hawks (and of Preston Sturges and Frank Tashlin) survived two rapid drafts from Benton &amp; Newman and a polish from Buck Henry, to infuse the misalliance of absent-minded musicologist O'Neal and all-purpose kook Streisand with about the right amount of madcap frenzy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A frantic, scattershot satire on '50s morals, advertising, sex and television. The not inconsiderable charms of Jayne Mansfield are much to the fore, but it's Randall's performance as timid advertising executive Rockwell Hunter that holds the whole thing together. While trying to persuade Mansfield to employ her oh-so-kissable lips in a commercial for Stay-Put lipstick, Randall finds himself inadvertently promoted as the world's hottest lover - much to the chagrin of his fiance (Drake). Not in the same league as the wonderful <i>Girl Can't Help It,</i> but possessed of the same comic strip vitality and frenzied humour.]]></review>

Totally irreverent towards patriotism, religion (a song proclaims 'We Got Guns, They Got Guns, All God's Chillun Got Guns'), diplomacy, courtroom justice, and anything even vaguely respectable, it also includes what is perhaps the Brothers' funniest scene ever: an immaculately timed and performed sequence with a broken mirror in which Groucho, Chico and Harpo look absolutely identical.

In between, accepted notions of beauty get flipped over on their bum as the sublime Divine sails through her various guises (loving mother, mugger, model and mass murderer), taking time out to double as her own deflowerer.

      <review><![CDATA[An amazingly sprightly account of a day in the life of a car wash, demonstrating that work is a four-letter word (especially if you happen to be black or underprivileged), and concerned partly with the variety of excretory messes that have to be dealt with, partly with the flights of ribald fancy indulged in by the employees in an effort to while away the hours till closing time. The remarkable thing is the way characters, jokes and meaning are dovetailed into a single rhythmic flow that makes the film look like TV's <i>Laugh-In</i> redesigned as a Minnelli musical. Highly enjoyable.]]></review>

There are in addition three classic sequences: one in which Harold becomes glued to the girl he's wooing; another when he visits the LA publishers to whom he's submitted his book and is mobbed by the hysterical typing pool; and finally the climactic rescue chase, to prevent the marriage of the girl to a mustachioed bigamist, with its glorious string of knife-edge stunts.]]></review>

From there on, Blake Edwards flexes his Jacques Tati muscles, spinning an elaborate garland of gags around one rather drawn-out situation as Sellers - seconded by a drunken waiter and a baby elephant - innocently reduces the party by degrees to an apocalyptic shambles and his hosts to gibbering wrecks. Quite a few very funny moments, but one doesn't laugh so much as admire the ingenuity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Based on a real-life murder case that scandalised New Zealand in the '50s, Peter Jackson's movie marks a welcome change from the splatter of <i>Bad Taste</i> and <i>Braindead</i>. Rather than focus on the final act of violence, the film explores the overheated encounter between two teenagers: clever, cocky Juliet (Winslet), from a well-to-do English family, and pudgy, initially more introspective Pauline (Lynskey), a working-class girl. The pair's obsession with books, Mario Lanza, the fearsome Orson Welles and other 'saints' leads them to create their own 'Fourth World', a medieval fantasy involving royal romance and bloody intrigue; but when their parents decide that the friendship is 'wayward' and 'unhealthy', the girls' terror at the prospect of separation impels daydreams to invade reality, with deadly results. Jackson's film is distinguished by the intensity of the girls' secretive relationship. If the busy camera movements used to convey the heady exhilaration of their early encounters are irritating, the sense of claustrophobic immersion in private mysteries is palpable. Acted with conviction, and directed and written with febrile vibrancy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Dedicated to Dennis Potter, this borrows his idea of having characters burst into lip synched song to express the feelings they cannot voice in ordinary conversation. This doesn't work quite the same way with French <i>chansons</i> as it did with Anglo-American standards (although there is a delicious moment when Jane Birkin, doing a cameo, 'sings' a snatch of one of her own songs), but the real problem is that Resnais remains fixated on the toothless bourgeois satire which has dominated his work since <i>Mlo</i>. The characters here - an unhappy salesman who writes radio plays on the side, a tourist guide, a ruthless property developer - are simply too banal for their romantic longings and mis-understandings to matter to most viewers. And that fatally weakens Resnais' point that clichd passions simmer beneath the blandest exteriors.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Silver Streak</i>, the train which travels from LA to Chicago and houses a murder, dawdles rather than streaks. Characters and plot ramble at will, and no matter how high Colin Higgins' script flies, Arthur Hiller's direction remains with feet and hands firmly on the ground. Wilder, who witnesses the foul deed, keys his performance to the right pitch of muted madness ('You like my new shoes?' he asks, stretched out on the heroine's bed). Clayburgh is a real sweetie, and Pryor isn't too far behind as a black dude thief. On the debit side, the fooling occasionally gets too boisterous for its own good; but it's rare enough to find a film designed to provide fun on a spectacular scale that succeeds even part of the time.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Robert Bloch (<i>Psycho</i>) scripted this <i>What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?</i> rip-off which unleashes Crawford for another bout of unrestrained self-parody. She's an axemurderer, who's released after 20 years in an asylum and returns to daughter Baker, whereupon the old girl's hallucinations recur and (surprise!) the slayings begin again. Basically terrible, and there's another mask-ripping scene at the end, but Joan's fans will not be disappointed.

      <review><![CDATA[America's rediscovery of lame-brain comedy brought this starring debut for Steve Martin. Behind the stoned humour, it's basically a Depression romance about a sucker in the big city, boosted and updated by some pleasingly irreverent twists like his black plantation home (a foundling, he reluctantly has to accept the awful truth that he's white). The trouble with retard comedy is that it rapidly degenerates into banana-skin jokes; but at its best, <i>The Jerk </i>manages to move its central character away from the merely moronic to a truly hysterical Pollyannaism, as when he becomes ecstatic at seeing his name in the phone-book, or jumps for joy at the sight of his new home (a men's toilet: 'Like it? I love it!'). The comedy runs out of steam when the jerk makes good, but laugh for laugh it's probably a better investment than <i>10.</i>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In a French provincial town, Henri Menard (Bacri) runs the old family restaurant where the clan convenes every Friday night. This Friday, everyone's ego is in for a bruising. A subtle, breezy comedy of manners, Klapisch's follow-up to <i>When the Cat's Away...</i> may not have quite the novelty and charm of that work, but otherwise it's a fresh and unassuming treat. Based on Bacri and Jaoui's award-winning play, the film avoids staginess, less through studied adjustment, than by naturalistic observation, delicately turned characterisation and confident performances. Pity, however, about the 'silent' dreamy flashbacks.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Joseph Kesselring's black comedy about two quaint spinsters with the murderous capabilities of Venus Flycatchers comes across as dusty but gentle entertainment. As transferred to the screen by Capra, it's dusty but ferocious, with rampant overacting and little sense of comic timing. Cary Grant, doing enough double-takes to dislocate his eyeballs for life, gives a particularly horrible performance. Best value is given by Massey and Lorre (playing two wandering criminals), who don't struggle to get laughs and just act macabre. It's all weird, but not wonderful.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Agns Jaouis marvellous movie is nominally centred on Lolita Cassard (Marilou Berry), a 20-year-old classical singer happy neither with her looks nor her relationship with her successful but self-centred writer father Etienne (Jean-Pierre Bacri); but it actually gives just as much room to her music teacher Sylvia (Jaoui), the womans struggling-novelist hubby Pierre (Laurent Grevill) and sundry other characters. All are caught up in an absurd, horribly familiar (from life, rather than cinema) dance of attraction and repulsion, ambition and disappointment, loyalty and betrayal. To reveal more would diminish the many pleasures to be had from what was one of the most warmly received films in Cannes last May; quite simply, its an enormously witty, touching, wondrously perceptive roundelay that examines contemporary manners and attitudes to family, friendship, physical appearance, celebrity, sex, age, art, class and the whole damn thing.<br />Some, I suppose, might bemoan the focus on arty bourgeois Parisians, but given that thats exactly the milieu Jaoui and Bacri are coming from, the account of their pretensions and often egotistical behaviour is beautifully barbed, unsentimental and credible; the couples writing is razor-sharp, the performances deft, carefully nuanced and rounded. (Even a character one might initially dismiss as a bimbo stereotype is allowed her moment of truth.) Are the articulate dialogue, humanist concerns and fascination with the relationship between life and art a bit old-fashioned? Who cares? This is exemplary cinema in the classical tradition, as lucid, subtle and pertinent in its social and philosophical implications as it is entertaining in its storytelling. Bravo!</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Cheech and Chong's first movie is the epitome of the serious doper's heaven and hell. Heaven: they drive around in a van made entirely from 100% 'Fibreweed'. Hell: they don't know it. Heaven: they find a whole plateful of coke in the aftermath of a party. Hell: they also find a lady with a nose like the Blackwall tunnel and sniffing power equal to any Jet-vac. Covering the gamut of a laid-back, laid-out LA dope bum's world - dumb cops, 'Nam, being busted, the eternal search for a 'lid' - the movie eventually gets too out of it, and tails off into easy visual gags rather than maintaining the spaced-out repartee that made Cheech and Chong so memorable. As the most fun comes not from watching the movie but from recalling great lines later, it would seem that the audio success of C &amp; C has not translated too well into visuals.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Survivors of Crispin Glovers appalling debut as a writer-director, <i>What Is It?</i>with its predominantly Down-syndromeafflicted cast and inexplicable malice toward snailswill be familiar with Steven C. Stewart; he was the man with cerebral palsy lying in the clamshell, enjoying a hand job from the woman in the monkey mask. Stewart (who died in 2001) wrote and stars in this long-nurtured, unrelated sequel, which is as surprising for its visual boldnessit looks like Lovelace-era porn as staged by David Lynchas it is for its sincerity. It suggests, at the very least, that Stewarts fantasies are preferable to Glovers.</p><p>Stewarts fever-dream alter ego is Paul, whoin the great Fassbinder traditionjust wants to be loved. Fittingly, the first woman to oblige is Petra von Kant herself, Margit Carstensen, here a divorced parent who solicits Pauls companionship but wont marry a cripple. Pauls brutal backlash is echoed in affairs with her jailbait daughter (Szlasa) and other women, all drawn to his innocence. With a set design at once primitive and garish<i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</i> is an obvious touchstone<i>It Is Fine! Everything Is Fine.</i> feels genuinely sui generis; Glover has said its the best film of his career. Whatever, McFly. But hes not far off.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This slippery fish of a docu-essay, packed to the gills with stimulating archive footage, is at once fun and deadly serious. It uses the 1960s films and TV shows of Alfred Hitchcock as a starting point to explore the relationship between the Cold War and the big and small screens, between reality and fear, especially relating to American identity in the 1960s but with some nods to the present. The theme of doubles runs throughout: we meet a current Hitch lookalike and watch as Khrushchev squares up to Nixon. Theres also humour, not least in the chauvinist coffee ads which Grimonperez quotes, which helps to soften the rapid blow of ideas, some of which are clearer on a first viewing than others.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Gathering his marbles (and any other weather-damaged, spring-loaded knick-knacks that may be in the vicinity) after the sepia-hued slushfest of A Very Long Engagement (2004), Frances master craftsman, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, returns with a comic potshot at the arms industry that makes for a hearty, if modest, return to form. <br />Firmly cleaving to his instantly distinguishable ersatz style in which cogs, pulleys and levers are tossed at the screen whenever possible, his story follows a band of oddballs as they administer a convoluted course of revenge on the tyrannical directors (Nicolas Mari and Andr Dussollier) of two rival weapons manufacturers. The catalyst for all this is the plight of body-popping video-store assistant Bazil (Dany Boon), whose father, we learn, is killed by a French-made landmine. To add injury to insult, Bazil is caught in the crossfire of a gun battle and gets a locally produced bullet lodged in his brain.<br />While its admirable that Jeunet has attempted to channel the mirth into a serious, unequivocally political statement, he does little to allow us to take his gestures seriously: its as if, say, Jacques Tati had chosen to make a film about the Rwandan genocide and insisted on keeping the silly hat. The point at which were supposed to see the funny side of extraordinary rendition is the glib gibe that pushes it over the edge. Yet, the film has its pleasures, namely the nimble, assured camera work and a script (written with regular Jeunet collaborator Guillaume Laurant) that constantly evokes the droll spirit of his hero, Jacques Prvert. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Alejandro Amenbar, the Spanish director of The Others and The Sea Inside, puts on his sword and sandals  and thinking cap  for this sweeping, ancient-historical drama of ideas. Current debates over religious extremism and scientific rationalism hover subtly over this fictionalisation of events surrounding the sacking of the library at Alexandria in 391 in the face of rising tension between pagans, Christians and Jews. As well as recreating the city with impressive realism and scale, Amenbar develops a compelling sense of volatility and impending violence. At the centre of it all is scientist and teacher Hypatia (a relaxed Rachel Weisz), whose musings on the place of the Earth in the universe run counter to religious dogma.<br /><br />Other characters, such as Hypatias former slave Davus (Max Minghella) and her pupil-turned-Roman prefect Orestes (Oscar Isaac) are only interesting as representatives of change  and not as romantic foils. The build-up of emnity is more absorbing than its explosion and the story wanders later on, but the films portrayal of how religious fervour can interrupt the progress of secular knowledge is acute and welcome.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[More relaxed - sloppy, even - than any of Coppola's usual busy films, this explores that universal fantasy of getting a second chance at your youth: a 40-year-old Turner faints at her high school reunion, and wakes 20 years earlier in 1960 during her last schooldays. The crux of her return is to sort out what later became a less-than-successful marriage to her feckless husband (Cage in endearingly dopey form). The movie is unfortunately bound to be compared with the much slicker <i>Back to the Future</i>. Ignore the ridiculous happy ending of this film, and you have a much more fatalistic exercise in which Coppola eschews easy laughs in favour of the exposure of feeling and the fact that these people's lives, however empty, matter to them. Turner is in the Oscar class. CPea.]]></review>

It starts off with some marvellously cruel moments, and Scott's performance towers over the proceedings throughout. But Hiller's direction is pretty shoddy, while the script eventually loses its way and begins to look increasingly hysterical, at the same time shamelessly trivialising Scott's crisis (sex cures all ills).]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The gore is toned down and the psychology played up in this darkly humorous adaptation of Stephen King's novel. Paul Sheldon (Caan) is a successful author of romantic fiction, but public demand for his heroine Misery Chastain has stifled his creativity; so after killing her off in a forthcoming final adventure, he writes a long-neglected personal novel. When a blizzard sends his car off the road on the drive home from his mountain retreat, his life is saved by nurse Annie Wilkes (Bates), who soon has the invalid tucked up in her home. It's a bonus that as his number one fan she's extremely attentive; and a definite minus that she's a psychopath who's looking forward to his next 'Misery' novel... William Goldman's intelligent script operates both as psycho-thriller and as sly comment on the sort of attitude towards celebrity which can enshrine and - in this case, literally - imprison the object of devotion. The casting is inspired: Caan oozes frustration at his physical disability, while Bates brings authority and an eerie naturalness to her demented character, her homespun expressions ('oogie', 'dirty birdy') providing a bizarre counterpoint to her increasingly cruel actions. Reiner captures <i>just</i> the right level of physical tension, but for the most part wisely emphasises the mental duels. Terrific.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[If you go to this adaptation of Stephen King's novel expecting to see a horror movie, you'll be disappointed. From the start, Kubrick undercuts potential tension builders by a process of anti-climax; eerie aerial shots accompanied by ponderous music prove to be nothing more than that; the setting is promising enough - an empty, isolated hotel in dead-of-winter Colorado - but Kubrick makes it warm, well-lit and devoid of threat. Granted, John Alcott's cinematography is impressive, and occasionally produces a 'look behind you' panic; but to hang the movie's psychological tension on the leers and grimaces of Nicholson's face (suited though it is to demoniacal expressions), while refusing to develop any sense of the man, is asking for trouble. Similarly, the narrative is too often disregarded in favour of crude and confusing visual shocks. Kubrick's unbalanced approach (over-emphasis on production values) results in soulless cardboard cutouts who can do little to generate audience empathy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Some targets are as easy to hit as holding a gun to the head of a newborn lamb, and sadly Richard Linklaters uneasy digestion and messy excretion of Eric Schlossers book plays to a sympathetic gallery with no attempt to transcend its liberal fanbase. The films characters and stories are numerous and coincidental: Don (Greg Kinnear) is a marketing exec for Mickeys, a national burger chain, who travels to Cody, a small town in Colorado and home to a meat-processing plant, to investigate claims of shit in the meat.<br /><br />We watch as Mexicans, including Sylvia (Catalina Sandino Moreno) and her boyfriend, Raul (Wilmer Valderrama) cross the US border and take jobs at the same, dangerous meat factory, while Amber (Ashley Johnson) works at the local Mickeys branch despite strong protests from her trendy uncle, Pete (Ethan Hawke) and the debates between local students, Paco (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Alice (Avril Lavigne).<br />Theres little in the films choppy narrative and unexceptional mise-en-scne thats equal to the books discomforting barrage of facts, figures and case studies, largely because Linklater and Schlossers script is a half-cocked and overloaded affair that aims condescendingly for a younger, less intelligent audience and fails to carve compelling or credible drama from its subject. Brief anti-corporate speeches from Hawke and Kris Kristofferson (as a local farmer) sound stuffy rather than tempting, and the messages are muddled: are we being told to hate both automation and meat? Why, too, does the trip across the Mexican border look like a walk in the park? There might be crap in the burgers, but theres no grit in the movie; It, kinda, doesnt feel real, stumbles Amber when, finally awakened, she quits the burger trade. Too right: best stick to the book.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It was the death of Humbert Balsan, the original producer of young French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Lves first film, Tout Est Pardone, that inspired the character of Grgoire Canvel (Louis-Do de Lencquesaing), a handsome and cultured Parisian film producer with a beautiful wife (Chiara Caselli), three young children, an apartment in the city and a house in the country. <br />The superficial order and enviable comfort of Grgoires home life contrasts with the chaos of his film company, Moon Films, a struggling and passionate outfit where theres not enough money in the bank or time in the day to satisfy the interests of both the arthouse filmmakers they produce and a growing list of creditors.<br />Theres a sadness at the core of Hansen-Lves impressive and moving second film, but it feels wrong to call it a tragedy, so gentle is her humanism and so light is her touch as a storyteller, both of which recall Eric Rohmers non-period films. The story involves a number of surprising, emotional twists (some too important to reveal), but the 29-year-old directors brisk and breezy style is to avoid the melodramatic and move on, while planting feelings in our minds to consider at our leisure. <br />Its a method familiar from her first film, in which she moved freely between characters in one family and was interested in their secrets and the bonds between a teenage girl and her parents. Here, her insistence on giving as much attention to the filmmaking process as emotions feels awkward at points, but the essence of the film is a welcome compassion and curiosity about inner lives.]]></review>

A chronicle of the indie arts-and-politics journal<i> Heresies,</i> which was published from 1977 to 1992 in NYC, the film profiles the collective of womyn behind it, including the director. Its an unnecessarily quirky affair, with collages, archival footage and interviews in extreme close-up, whichperhaps intentionallymake it seem like an experimental 70s throwback. Still, considering we have yet to see a female President or pass the ERA, its message feels crucialeven if we gals would like to think weve bridged the gender gap. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Harvey Weinstein released cut versions of foreign films in America in the 90s; he called it art. Brett Ratner (Rush Hour series, X Men: The Last Stand) terms his Bollywood delve a remix. Confused? You will be on seeing this half an hour shorter version of the Hindi language is no barrier to love original. Ratners edited reboot is rather pointless given the fact that the slightly longer version is an accessible, engaging if unmemorable watch. Minor scenes which flesh out the characters and relationships and the unobstrusive songs on the soundtrack get the chop. Some cheesy English dialogue, a coy semi-nude encounter and noirish-type music are the replacement. The result is uncomplicated soft-core corn reflective of Ratners MTV style. Notable, but only for its novelty value. ]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
Apart from its sheer poignancy, the main achievement of Murnau's classic silent weepie is how it puts pep into pap. Its folksy fable is distinctly unusual: a love triangle dissolving into an attempted murder is only the start; two thirds of the movie is actually about a couple making up. The tension is allowed to drop in a glorious jazz-age city sequence, and then twisted into breaking-point as a journey of murderous rage is repeated. But its dreamlike realism is also to be enjoyed: when lovers appear to walk across a crowded city street, into (superimposed) fields, and back to kiss in a traffic jam, you have an example of True Love styled to cinema perfection. Simple, and intense images of unequalled beauty. DMacp.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Great athletes are often compared to artists, though only a handful truly deserve that lofty compliment. But footballer Zindine Zidane is one of them; seeing this fleet French-Algerian midfielder snake through defenders is like watching soccers Baryshnikov. Douglas Gordon and Philippe Parreno have taken the notion a step further: The duo have made an art doc that focuses solely on Zidane during a complete 2005 Real Madrid match. The players the thing, and sports fans yearning for bigger-picture highlights may tear their hair out. Structuralist-film aficionados, however, will be in heaven.</p><p>Zidane struts and frets in real time while Mogwais moody post-rock drones on. When the athlete does finally spring into action, youre taken aback by his fluidity; even the close-ups of Zidane coolly observing the pitch are hypnotic. (The filmmakers decision to recall the days global events during halftime, however, is anything but mesmerizing.) He remains a Sphinx-like character, even after one ecstatic smile and a red-card ejection(which takes on weight, considering how his head-butting of an Italian opponent during 2006s World Cup tarnished his legacy). Yet to see everything boiled down to one mans stillness and movement is a transcendentalist high, a concentrated dose of poetry in motion.</p>]]></review>

Like Sylvain Chomet (2003s <i>The Triplets of Belleville</i>) and Hayao Miyazaki, French animator Michel Ocelotbest known for 1998s <i>Kirikou and the Sorceress</i>has developed a sui generis style thats both of its time (hes not against using the latest CGI techniques) and somewhat out of it (there are no references to contemporary pop culture).</p><p>After a prologue set in medieval Europe, <i>Azur &amp; Asmar</i> moves to an unspecified North African land where the title characters (Kyman, Pilkington) embark on a journey to free the Djinn Fairy. Framing his film as the type of quest frequently found in tales from the Middle Ages (both in Europe and the Arab world), Ocelot gently underscores the silliness of superstitions and comments on the preposterousness of prejudiceincluding the gender-based kindwith a remarkably subtle touch.</p><p>Not only that, but <i>Azur &amp; Asmar </i>is absolutely gorgeous, as the director integrates visual elements and techniques drawn from medieval illuminations and Arabic art, including painstakingly rendered mosaics and architectural details. As the film foreshadows how religious fundamentalism crushed both this art and scientific research, Ocelot honors both light and enlightenment.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Straying perilously close to TV-movie territory, this latest from Italian veteran Comencini manages to inject what sounds like an MOR textbook weepie, about the emotional toil of premature birth, with a serious dose of integrity and pathos. This is chiefly down to a very affecting and discreet performance from Buy as self-assured middle aged teacher Maria who is unable to hold down a relationship. Her life takes a turn for the existentially harrowing as another fleeting lover waves her goodbye and she finds herself alone and carrying child. After a needlessly baggy preamble, the focus sharpens in the second half as Maria is forced to take stock of her life and her future as her daughter spends a crucial two months inside an incubator. A little soapy, for sure, but it wont take much for you to succumb to the films life-affirming charms. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Nicolas Cage is the main attraction in this redux-in-name-only of Abel Ferraras 1992 Manhattan morality tale, especially as he appears to be channeling the ghost of director Werner Herzogs legendary muse, Klaus Kinski. Playing corrupt New Orleans cop Terence McDonagh, the actor lurches with a Kinski-esque gait (bug-eyed and slope-shouldered, frequently twisting his body into the frame like a haughty zombie) and holsters a .44 Magnum awkwardly above his crotch as if hes both brandishing an appendage and tempting fate.</p><p>Cage is not quite Aguirre or Fitzcarraldo in the Big Easy. But his performance hits all the right mythopoetic beats, rising above the thin script and late-night-cable aesthetic. Theres plenty here for another of those <i>Wicker Man</i> YouTube compilationsonly Cage could find the perfect inflections for a line like, Im gonna kill all of youto the break of dawn!though the sense that were watching a highlight reel first and a movie second is pretty pervasive. </p><p>This doesnt apply to just the films star. Herzogs clearly on ecstatic truth autopilot, lazily gazing at the city around him, and coming fully alive only when he diverges from the post-Katrina noir shadings. The end credit Iguana/Alligator Footage by Werner Herzog hints at what he does best: making the commonplace ineffably strange. When he introduces one of those scaly reptiles into a shoot-out between McDonagh and some gangstersa scene that also features a guys soul break-dancing and a reprise of the chicken-dance theme from Stroszekthe effect is sublime. Ditto the reportedly improvised climactic passages, which grow out of a brilliant non sequitur: Do fish have dreams? asks a drug-addled McDonagh. Herzog always dreams, even when hes sleepwalking through a second-tier effort.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[I predicted in a review of The Bounty Hunter that, while that was bad, there would be worse in 2010. Well, make way for Number One. Although the two films are similar  both are built on marital strife, knockabout violence and shouting  Bounty Hunter at least had the comic charisma of Jennifer Aniston to paper over the cracks. With Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher in the leads, charm is not an option.<br />Its a shame, because theres a half-decent premise to Killers. Kutcher plays Spencer, a CIA hitman who turns in his gun when he falls for Heigls meek daddys girl. So it comes as a surprise to her when, three years into their marriage, it turns out all their suburban neighbours are also hired killers, paid to keep Spencer in line. Director Robert Luketics grasp of action is almost as ham-fisted as his understanding of character, and Kutcher and Heigl are unable to bring any warmth to what is at heart a bitter, cynical script. Just awful.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>For more than four decades, Romero has used the tropes of the zombie movie to reflect on American society: As many have noted, <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> allegorized the social tensions of the 60s, <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> embodied Me Decade consumerism, <i>Day of the Dead</i> found its horrors in a hyper-Reaganite world without government, and <i>Land of the Dead</i> and <i>Diary of the Dead</i>, in their own ways, reflected on the Iraq War. But <i>Survival of the Dead</i>
is the first living-dead installment that feels as if it was made
on-demand, without a compelling target. Romero seems invested in
finding new weapons for zombie killsflare gun, barbecue forkbut
although he takes on the (for him) marginal challenge of making a
zombie Western, he seems uninterested in the actors, the hideous
digital videography or the story.</p><p><i>Survival</i> mostly takes
place on an island off the coast of Delaware where for some reason
everyone speaks with an overwrought Irish brogue. Theres a feud
between the OFlynns and the Muldoons, ysee, who argue over whether to
kill their zombie friends or keep them alive in chains as reminders of
the past. Our stake in this debate is minimal, which may be the point.
At the movies Toronto premiere last year, a programmer suggested that
the two clans were meant to represent Republicans and Democrats. Romero
felt his message was broader, and that it was basically a movie about
war. What zombie picture isnt? This series shouldnt end with such a
putrefying corpse.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An eccentric thriller meandering an uneasy route between jet-set melodrama - Kinski quits small town college to become top model - and terrorist activities, with Keitel not really at his most convincing as terrorism's Paris kingpin. Toback's earlier <i>Fingers</i> won some critical support, and his script here is not without philosophical moments concerning the ambiguities of the 'look' and the 'self'; but <i>Exposed </i>does not entirely have the courage of its frequently heady high art absurdities, despite moments like the one in which Nureyev (cast as a renowned violinist) literally attempts to play Kinski's body like a violin. For this kind of material the temperature must not be allowed to drop, but it frequently does.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The kind of film (made in six days, almost entirely in a Poverty Row studio, its extensive road scenes shot with back projection) that would be impossible to make today, even as a TV movie. Now it would require 100% locations (the 'art' of studio shooting having been discredited and thus lost), and the minimal narrative would never justify a go-ahead (pianist Neal is bumming from New York to rejoin his girl in California until tripped by hostile fate and the literally amazing femme fatale Savage). Neither pure thriller nor pure melodrama (though it has its true complement of doomed lovers, dead bodies, and a cruel sexual undertow), on an emotional level it most resembles the wonderful purple-pulp fiction of David Goodis. Passion joins with folly to produce termite art par excellence.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of the sly, Spanish provocateurs greatest popular successes, Belle de Jour  revived in a new print as centrepiece of a two-month NFT Buuel retrospective  is a mischievously deadpan and classically cool 1967 adaptation of Joseph Kessels cheap fictionalised tale of a Parisian doctors wife who secretly volunteers for the two-till-five shift at an upmarket brothel. It opens with French cinemas prim, fair Miss Frigidaire, Catherine Deneuve, being roughly trussed and stripped by her husband, before the little whore is whipped and distainfully left for the carnal satisfaction of his two coachmen. As Buuel and his scriptwriter Jean-Claude Carrire make clear, this is a mere fantasy in the head of their masochistic heroine. Nevertheless, it was received as a confrontational liberationist shock at the time. If, for us jaded children and grandchildren of the 60s, 40 years of bombardment by explicit sexual imagery has made that impact unrecoverable, the undiminished power of the film resides more in the mesmeric audacity of Buuels method. The productive friction  be it between the salacious material and the chaste formality of how its observed; the ersatz elegance of the salon and the perverse etiquettes of the Yves Saint Laurent-clothed, cigarette-chewing prostitutes and their clients; or the hallucinatory melding of fantasy and reality  still generates heat like a nuclear reactor.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[After <i>Tom Jones</i>, Tony Richardson launched into a series of extremely ambitious films (<i>The Loved One</i>, <i>The Sailor from Gibraltar</i> and <i>Mademoiselle</i>) which were all lambasted by the critics for their pretentiousness. This one boasts a script by Jean Genet which was partially rewritten by no less than four writers (David Rudkin, Michel Cournot, Oscar Lewenstein, and Richardson himself), and the results were understandably mixed, though not nearly as awful as <i>The Sailor from Gibraltar</i>, which deserves its reputation as the most meaningless movie of the '60s. Here, Jeanne Moreau plays a strung-up French schoolteacher who is driven by her lust for a woodcutter to commit a series of atrocities, but the whole thing suffers from Richardson's terrible addiction to artistic overstatement (not to mention the difficulty of making an intimate drama with an international cast speaking several languages).]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Neil Jordan has fallen into a regular pattern of late, following every trip to Hollywood with a more personal Irish indie. You can feel the loving care in every frame of Ondine, but that only serves to make this saccharine, crudely plotted romance feel even more misguided. <br />Colin Farrell plays Syracuse, a trawlerman and recovering alcoholic who pulls a mysterious, scantily clad woman (Alicja Bachleda) from the sea in his net. Bringing her to the mainland, Syracuse and his disabled daughter (the terrific Alison Barry) become convinced that the stranger, who calls herself Ondine, is in fact a mythical selkie: part woman, part seal. <br />These unabashed fairy-tale elements fit uncomfortably with the more earthbound elements of Jordans script, not to mention his habit of getting Bachleda to shed her clothes at every opportunity. A clunky third-act shift into thriller territory only makes Ondine more confused: ambitious and deeply felt, to be sure, but also winsome and wildly uneven.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Reality meets genre in a pacy exploration of events surrounding the Robert Mapplethorpe's posthumous 1990 exhibition. Notorious for his frank depiction of children and gay SM practices, the American photographer was admired and reviled. When Dennis Barrie (Woods), director of the Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center, goes ahead with the show, despite pressure from his Board and right-wing campaigners, obscenity charges are brought. The trial tests Barrie's family ties, while shaping as a key battle in the struggle for freedom of expression. So far, so worthy (and worthwhile), but the film lifts off from its factual origins to deliver a major plea for tolerance and minority understanding, and against political censorship in culture generally. Coming over at times like a radical left-field essay film, it weaves talking heads (Salman Rushdie, William Buckley Jr, politicos and creatives) with archive and news footage to build a profound argument about the ramifications for the entire community of such 'slippery slope' behaviour.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Like Bob Rafelson, a director similarly obsessed with the trials and tribulations of the children of the rich, Ashby forever treads the thin line between whimsy and absurdity and 'tough' sentimentality and black comedy. <i>Harold and Maude</i> is the story of a rich teenager (Cort) obsessed with death - his favourite pastime is trying out different mock suicides - who is finally liberated by his (intimate) friendship with Ruth Gordon, an 80-year-old funeral freak. It is most successful when it keeps to the tone of an insane fairystory set up at the beginning of the movie.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In Zodiac, the serial killer is a setter of engrossing puzzles, a bit like a crossword compiler, or a certain type of film director. David Finchers movies have always had this flavour: The Game, Panic Room, Fight Club, Alien3 are all cat-and-mouse affairs of one kind or another; Se7en proposed multiple murder as literary pop quiz. Zodiac isnt a puzzle film in quite that way; instead its subject is the compulsion to solve puzzles, and its coup is the creeping recognition, quite contrary to the flow of crime cinema, of how fruitless that compulsion can be.<br />Stretching from 1969 to 1991, the film is based on the series of killings that petrified San Francisco during the 70s, and more specifically on the book written about them by Robert Graysmith. Played by a typically puppyish Jake Gyllenhaal, Graysmith was a San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist whose fascination with the murders engendered a kind of partnership with foppishly dissolute crime editor Paul Avery (a wrapped gift of a part for Robert Downey Jr), mirrored in the investigations of police detectives Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards.<br /> Portraying the Zodiacs attack on a young couple in a car in a deserted make-out spot, the opening scene  one of several bravura suspense sequences  cant help but recall slasher convention; the investigation that follows seems like a pacey procedural. But the clues dont quite fit together, the solution doesnt come, and as procedure sprawls into obsession the tone shifts from genre picture to something more like curious observation  sometimes sympathetic, sometimes almost mocking  of the refusal to let go. Perhaps some puzzles should be set aside.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This is a brutal, mesmerising film from Dane Nicolas Winding Refn (Pusher, Bronson), dominated by Mads Mikkelsen as a mute fighter, whose journey from twelfth-century Scotland to a strange New World is an odyssey of self-realisation. Enslaved by a pagan Scottish clan chieftain, the nameless warrior is chained and forced to fight to the death in hand-to-hand bouts staged for amusement and betting. Escaping with the help of a young boy, who names him One-Eye, the warrior learns to use weapons and joins a band of Vikings, but these are Christian converts bound for Jerusalem to reclaim the city for their faith. Their ship, however, is enveloped by a mysterious mist, which finally lifts to reveal an unknown land. Lost, hungry and under attack from the natives, the Viking converts lose their faith and lose their minds, turning on one another  but the enigmatic One-Eye discovers his destiny and embraces his essential self. <br />There are shades here of Terrence Malicks elemental feel for landscape, the doomed colonial enterprise of Werner Herzogs Aguirre, Wrath of God and Vincent Wards visionary The Navigator: A Medieval Odyssey, yet Refn makes this hypnotic, dreamlike film entirely his own. The pace slows like a fighters heart in the second half, demanding an act of faith that some may find hard after the early intensity. But the breathtaking digital photography and an atmospheric electronic score sustain the mood, and for those who see this savage journey through to the end, there are riches aplenty.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When twenty-something, travelling Brooklynite (Bones) misses his cruise-ship home, he finds Jamaicas one love is in short supply. Recently dumped by Norah Jones and now dumped-on by American and Caribbean cultures alike, his journey back to the embassy is a slackers odyssey of tropical fish, trippy-pills, and a Patois-jammin soundtrack. Emerging filmmakers Chance and Fleischner offer a laid-back and eclectic series of locations to hang-out in leading to a film that is more a mumblecore chill-out session than a genre-revving road-trip. Sure, the film doesnt go anywhere particularly momentous, but its an enjoyable homage to the Obamarama zeitgeist that says things-can-only-get-better. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
Refused a US censor's rating, this adaptation of Hubert Selby's 1978 novel is as visually experimental and thematically uncompromising as director Aronofsky's first feature <i>Pi</i>. A relentless sensory assault threatens to overwhelm the viewer, but the visceral images and frantic editing capture the euphoric 'highs' and repetitive rituals of drug blighted lives, while drawing clear parallels between the characters' different forms of addiction. Aronofsky interweaves the tales of four Coney Island residents, each desperate to escape a dull existence. Burstyn gives a fearless, heartbreaking performance as Sara Goldfarb, a widow who shrugs off lethargy when promised an appearance on her favourite TV game show; but an amphetamine-based crash diet slowly disconnects her from reality. Her junkie son Harry (Leto) dreams of becoming a bigtime dealer with his friend Tyrone (Wayans). With the profits, Harry plans to open a clothes shop, based on his girlfriend Marion's designs. Burnished camerawork and ex-Pop Will Eat Itself head Mansell's part-punchy, part-elegiac score reinforce and counterpoint the increasingly nightmarish visuals.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Whod have thought metatextually inflected existential crises would get a comedy subgenre all of their own? Its largely down to Charlie Kaufman, of course, whose scripts for Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind established that postmodern audiences dont mind their narratives served both scrambled and pre-digested  especially if they come with side orders of wit and outr animation. The mode has since been taken up by David O Russell (I Heart Huckabees), Kaufmans collaborator Michel Gondry (the forthcoming The Science of Sleep), and first-time feature writer Zach Helm, with this sometimes enjoyable if more conventional tale.<br />Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick, a chronically unassuming taxman with a problem: hes got a narrator, a voice in his head (Emma Thompsons, in fact) providing a commentary on his actions, feelings and condition, but inaudible to everyone else, including the feisty but warm-hearted caf-owner hes auditing (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Desperate, he turns to lit crit prof Dustin Hoffman (more or less reprising his Huckabees schtick) for advice.<br />A great idea for a formally playful short stitched to a standard-issue opposites-attract romcom, Stranger than Fiction benefits from brisk pacing and engaging performances  especially from an affectingly muted Ferrell, who pulls off a coup comparable to Jim Carreys breakout metaphysical stooge role in The Truman Show. But the film struggles under its increasingly weighty pretensions to literary credibility and even tragic status, stumbling towards an unconvincing and cloying conclusion. Deconstructing fiction is one thing, taping it back together again quite another.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Three isnt exactly a magic number for DreamWorks emerald ogre, but unlike other recent trilogy conclusionswere talking to you, Web-slingerat least you get more than franchise fatigue. Shrek the Thirds verse is much the same as the first, and exactly what youd expect. Besides our green hero (Myers) and his royal bride (Diaz), both the wisecracking Donkey (Murphy) and the sequels Puss in Boots (Banderas) are back for more banter. [Yay! Ha-ha!] Theres also an army of fairy-tale villains enlisted to attack the kingdom of Far, Far Away. [Boo! Hiss!] And for the older folks, heres some Oprah-friendly discussion about parental anxiety and the chronic fear of success. [Mommy, Im bored. Are there any Goobers left?]<br />Never mind the central narrative about searching for pimply teenage Arthur Pendragon (voiced by Justin Timberlake, who leaves the sexy at home). Pop-culture in-jokery is still the coin of this seriess realm, and Third hits pay dirt several times: Led Zeppelins Immigrant Song riff becomes a boffo punch line, while a bit involving a gingerbread mans life flashing before his eyes is pure genius. But though the wink-wink setups wisely avoid outstaying their welcome  la Shrek 2, they never really get fully realized either. Why establish fertile medieval high-school and princesses-are-doin-it-for-themselves scenarios, only to drop them after a scant handful of gags? Even the big climax feels over before its started. Kids craving a safe summer-film sugar rush wont care much, though adult fans are bound to wish upon a star for something besides another animated feature running on autopilot.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>You know the <i>Ramayana, </i>right? That ancient Sanskrit epic about a divine being named Rama whose wife, Sita, is snatched by demons? (The question is rhetorical.) Nina Paleys phantasmagoric toon isnt an adaptation of the Hindu text per se, though anyone unfamiliar with Valmikis poem will know their rakshas from their vanaras before the end. Rather, this colorful, cranium-bursting film isnt about one specific tale so much as the endless ways you can present narratives; its nothing less than a kitchen-sink deconstruction on the art of storytelling. While this cinematic version of the centuries-old tearjerker replicates 16th-century Indian art, shadow puppets break in and offer critical commentaries. Occasionally, a vixen blessed with perfectly spherical voluptousness will croon Annette Hanshaws 20s blues tunes to complement Sitas sorrow. Meanwhile, a modern-day woman named Nina picks up a book that, oddly enough, reflects on her own relationship troubles. </p><p>Paleys penchant for mixing stylesslick computer animation, chicken-scratch comic-strip drawings, rapid-fire photo collagesonly underlines the myriad of methods for spinning the same yarn, though the musical vignettes court repetitiveness. Her metaplayful approach (theres even an intermission) and integration of the personal, however, make such faults seem minor. Pairing aggressive visuals with art-history chops and anything-goes ideology, shes made something universal and completely unique. </p>]]></review>

Davis has a field day as the petulant Long Island heiress who wields her riding-crop to humble the Irish chauffeur (Bogart, no less, badly miscast), then learns she has only months to live and spends the rest of her time discovering resignation and romantically dying (partnered, alas, by the soggy Brent). She and Goulding almost transform the soap into style; a Rolls-Royce of the weepie world.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Actually made before <i>Broken Arrow</i>, but held up by a nervous MGM so that the Delmer Daves film reaped all the kudos for spearheading the pro-Indian cycle of Westerns. Taylor is the Indian who, having fought for the North in the war between the states, returns to his homelands only to find that the war against racism has still not been won. Mann's first Western, which he shoots as if it were a <i>film noir</i> and makes into a tough, bleak and cynical tragedy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An elegant narrative of moral musical chairs, Pabst's last silent film not only plays on who holds what kind of legitimate place in society, but is also a starkly direct view of inter-war Germany. Feasting the camera on Brooks' radiant beauty, Pabst follows the adventures of innocence led astray in the shape of Thymian, a pharmacist's daughter. Her progress from apple of her father's eye, through sexual lapse and approved school, to darling of an expensive brothel and finally to dowager countess, gives Pabst the opportunity to measure the Germany of the Weimar republic against Brooks' embodiment of a vitality so exuberant that it equals innocence. However damning, though, Pabst's indictment of the bourgeoisie as torn between powerless compassion, greed and scandal-lust, his alternatives - the brothel as the one place of true friendship, or the aristocratic father-figure who puts everything right in the end - smack very much of a cop-out, allowing him to both revel in decadence and enjoy the moral  superiority of denouncing it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A superbly chilling essay in the supernatural, adapted from Daphne du Maurier's short story about a couple, shattered by the death of their small daughter, who go to Venice to forget. There, amid the hostile silences of an off-season resort, they are approached by a blind woman with a message of warning from the dead child; and half- hoping, half-resisting, they are sucked into a terrifying vortex of time where disaster may be foretold but not forestalled. Conceived in Roeg's usual imagistic style and predicated upon a series of ominous associations (water, darkness, red, shattering glass), it's hypnotically brilliant as it works remorselessly toward a sense of dislocation in time; an undermining of all the senses, in fact, perfectly exemplified by Sutherland's marvellous Hitchcockian walk through a dark alley where a banging shutter, a hoarse cry, a light extinguished at a window, all recur as in a dream, escalating into terror the second time round because a hint of something seen, a mere shadow, may have been the dead child.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Nick Curran (Douglas) is a cop on the edge. Investigated for an over-zealous approach to his work, saddled with a drink and relationships problem, he becomes slowly embroiled with the case, then with the suspect, when a former rock star is found murdered at the climax of some bondage-style sex. Catherine Tramell (Stone), an ultra-clever, ultra-rich author and bisexual free spirit, is at the core of all the basic instinct paraded in the film. One scene in which she teases and bosses a roomful of hard law enforcement men is probably the best illustration of post-feminism in action that Hollywood has offered. Yet the film's depiction of not one but several bisexual women with murky, murderous pasts has angered activists, and does illustrate that sensitivity is not always the strong suit of Verhoeven or scriptwriter Joe Eszterhas. But if you like things unrestrained, hard, adult and off-the-rails, then Douglas and Stone are superb, and George Dzundza (as sidekick Gus) delivers another classic hard-boiled cameo.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[America's obsession with Jackie Kennedy-Onassis-who-next is overwhelming, and presumably the reason for the success there of this documentary about two of her family who live in isolated squalor on Long Island; a film that is voyeuristic in the extreme, extending no warmth to the bizarre mother and daughter as they battle out their lives together, but choosing instead to film them in the most offensive of ways. Like the shots of 'Little' Edith Bouvier Beale, a large 56-year-old, taken from below as she climbs upstairs in a miniskirt, rambling to herself; or 'Big' Edith, the demanding 79-year-old mother, with her towel falling off her withered, naked body. As Big Edie sings and Little Edie dances, both adoring the transient attentions of the film crew, you can only wonder what happened once the party was over.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A bracingly bilious and loquacious Mankiewicz film that turns a highly esteemed gynaecologist (Grant) into a mouthpiece for the director's State of the Union address. The US of A is in a terrible state, and Grant's treatment of an unmarried mother (Crain) is heavily symbolic: her apparent immorality (Mankiewicz was amazed that the Hays Office approved the script) is set against the darker crimes and hypocrisies of American society. The man who made Crain pregnant dies in Korea; a university professor (Cronyn) stands in for Senator McCarthy; and there are pungent swipes at tax evasion and the crass materialism of the postwar boom. The fact that Mankiewicz can contain all this within the context of a romantic comedy testifies to his immense sophistication, and Grant's performance is one of his very best.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Where Trevor Rhone's script for <i>The Harder They Come</i> relocated Hollywood B movie conventions in a specifically Jamaican context, his first film as director does much the same with the stock material of British comedy. From this he's crafted a genuinely hilarious politicised farce; a satire on tourism that centres on hotel waiter Ringo Smith's efforts to exploit the exploiters. One long, two-handed scene exemplifies the balance Rhone achieves, when Ringo (Bradshaw) takes a raw busboy in hand, informs him that 'any black man that can't play a part's gonna starve to death', and proceeds first to teach him waiting etiquette, then how to screw white tourists, literally and figuratively. The Mocho Beach Hotel, main locale of this anarchic entertainment, has inevitably been characterised as a Jamaican <i>Fawlty Towers</i>, but it's hard to imagine even Basil rigging a crab race! Black joy indeed, from which a few technical rough ends detract nothing.]]></review>

Spiers' pseudo-documentary bubble-and-squeak allows the girls to dress up, dress down, change identities, ride around in a Union Jack bus, rub shoulders with a large cameo cast, and indulge in vacuous banter.

      <review><![CDATA[The superbly labyrinthine plotting of <i>Blood Simple </i>must have been a hard act to follow; praise be, then, to the Brothers Coen for confounding all expectations with this fervently inventive comedy. Sublimely incompetent convenience-store robber Hi McDonnough (Cage, at his best yet) seems doomed to return repeatedly to the same penitentiary until true love hoves in view in the form of prison officer Edwina (Hunter). Spliced in a trice, the frustratedly infertile couple kidnap one (surely he won't be missed?) of the celebrated Arizona quintuplets, heirs to an unpainted-furniture fortune. But happiness being evanescent, complications ensue when a pair of Hi's old cellmates turn up in search of sanctuary; and then there's the problem of a rabbit-shooting biker of hellish hue, hired by Arizona Senior to find his missing brat. What makes this hectic farce so fresh and funny is the sheer fertility of the writing, while the lives and times of Hi, Ed and friends are painted in splendidly seedy colours, turning Arizona into a mythical haven for a memorable gaggle of no-hopers, halfwits and has-beens. Starting from a point of delirious excess, the film leaps into dark and virtually uncharted territory to soar like a comet.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Though seldom seen now, Antonioni's fourth feature is one of his greatest films, in which diverse plot strands, character psychology, and a masterful control of the camera are perfectly fused. Drawn from Pavese, the story begins when local-girl-made-good Clelia returns to Turin to open a fashion salon, and finds the girl in the hotel room next to her has attempted suicide. This introduces Clelia to a new set of friends, whose various amorous problems become the focus of interest. With two bravura set pieces - a picnic by the sea that foreshadows <i>L'Avventura</i>, and a troubled tea party - Antonioni's intensity and grip, and his vivid portrayal of feminine anxiety in particular, make for a film that has barely dated at all.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Who cares about cruelty to animals? You should, suggests this documentary narrated by Julie Christie, not just cranks and misty-eyed pet-lovers with more sentiment than sense, because it's a basic political issue as much as a moral/emotional one. Animal abuse means mega-profits for factory farming and pharmaceutics, but the final appeal is to naked self-interest rather than compassion: when life is held cheap, it's a small step from mutilating pigs in H-bomb tests today to annihilating people tomorrow. The film uses expressive montage to drive its points home with a raw and blistering anger that can't fail to move, even if you don't always entirely agree (or care to watch the screen).]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its almost tempting to see this reissue of Martin Scorseses uncomfortably visceral, neon-lit portrait of psychotic urban alienation as the NFTs sly riposte to Superman Returns  a lesson in the dangers of unchecked Messianism and the urge to cure a sick world. In fact its showing as part of the season devoted to composer Bernard Herrmann, whose remarkable score  completed hours before his death in December 1975  offers our best chance of understanding increasingly unhinged zero-tolerance cabbie Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) on his own terms. <br />A vet who takes to nocturnal cab-driving as a distraction from chronic insomnia, Bickle is a casualty of the sex war as well as Vietnam, seeking to rescue first Presidential campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) and then juvenile prostitute Iris (12-year-old Jodie Foster, already adept at spinning humiliation into self-reliance) from what he perceives as the cesspit of Manhattan. Scorsese offers a fair bit of support for this perspective, from the banal closed-mindedness of Bickles fellow drivers to the directors own cameo as a murderously jealous passenger.<br />Initially, De Niros performance is a masterclass in contained indignation and a creepy willingness to be amused; Herrmanns bluesy saxophone voices Bickles world-weary romanticism even as cymbal and snare crescendos hint at seismic ructions rumbling underneath. Once set on a course of self-aggrandising retribution, the score echoes his determination, with martial horns and drums unnervingly offset by the hysterical harp of a self-appointed avenging angel. Yet when the metal trap into which Bickle has translated his body is sprung, the resulting carnage  still horrific two decades on  unfolds without music, before Scorsese ushers us into a profoundly unsettling coda. New York may have changed, but Taxi Driver is as powerful and painful as ever.]]></review>

A cracking little thriller about a pair of Treasury agents (O'Keefe and Ryder) required to infiltrate a Detroit counterfeiting gang, it effortlessly transcends its semi-documentary brief (with blandly 'official' commentary) to land deep in <i>noir </i>territory, concerned less with the heroic exploits of its T-Men than with personality perversities involved in undercover work (the wrenching imperative to deny friends, wives, feelings, even to the point of standing by while a partner is cold-bloodedly executed).

      <review><![CDATA[Best remembered, if at all, for his 1972 Philly Soul smoocher Me and Mrs Jones, vocalist Billy Paul probably should have gone on to bigger things. But it didnt happen for him, and the suggestion here is that his record company frightened off mainstream radio with his militant agit-groove follow-up Am I Black Enough For You. This Swedish doc cant quite construct a compelling drama from all this, but, as it follows todays seventysomething Paul around old haunts and on tour, you can feel the love in its affectionate portrait of a talent deserving wider recognition.<br /><br />A jazz-inflected stylist rather than a gospel shouter, Paul is still in good voice, though between nimbly shot concert highlights theres a fair degree of archive footage, sometimes heavy-handed in inscribing the context for the artists social-conscience-raising 70s tracks which have since found him a new audience among the rap cognoscenti. Slightly woolly overall, though you might find yourself buying the CDs. I did.]]></review>

And perhaps it's just those lowered expectations going to work, but '45365' feels like one of the most satisfying, original and enjoyable films in this year's LFF lineup: taking their cues from early Errol Morris, specifically 'Vernon, Florida', with little dashes of everyone from Mark Twain to Harmony Korine, the Rosses have created a dizzingly detailed, thoughtful, sympathetic but highly pragmatic celebration of the modern Midwest in all its beauty, complexity, stupidity and brilliance. If you've ever wanted to watch two informed rednecks argue passionately over whether The Who's 'Squeezebox' is about an accordion or a dildo, look no further.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A work of masterly daring and skill, the new Italian film I Am Love plays out in the late 1990s within a super-rich family called the Recchis. Their power base is a Milanese villa introduced to us by young director Luca Guadagnino as a gilded cage  a marble-and-stone palace too large and ornate to support intimate family life. In the films early scenes Guadagnino laps up this mansion, exploring it with a swirling, fluid camera that turns its world into a character itself. The fictional Recchis recall the Agnellis, another troubled industrialist family which feathered its nest on the back of fascism, but they trade in textiles, not cars, and Guadagnino gives us a brief shot of their mechanised looms at work to stress how business is woven into the fabric of this familys soul.<br />We meet the Recchis on the cusp of change  and change is the films main interest, along with the dangerous strength necessary for any woman to counter the forces of tradition and expectation in such a family. We begin by watching the elderly family head (Gabriele Ferzetti) at dinner as he nominates his successors in a scene of King Lear-like power and unnaturalness. But soon he is dead and our focus and heroine becomes Emma Recchi (Tilda Swinton), the dutiful Russian wife of Tancredi (Pippo Delbono), the familys new head, and mother to two grown-up sons and a daughter attempting her own flight from this patriarchal world. Emmas burgeoning friendship with her sons business partner, Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini), a rural chef, is the nudge that will bring this house of cards down in dramatic, tragic fashion. <br />The story is bold enough, but true daring is at play in the films style. Guadagnino has the confidence to mix big, brash Dallas-style establishing shots of Milan and London and complicated scenes of busy parties with much more intimate, expressive moments. Dialogue becomes less important as the film progresses, and Guadagnino invites us to read the film rather than the characters lips. He also manages to bring the film to an operatic crescendo without losing sight of emotional realities.<br />There are many reasons to recommend this sensual and good-looking film about personal and female liberation. The music is one; it is central to a work that demands that all the films elements work together to create a total cinema. Guadagnino and his star and co-producer, Swinton, persuaded John Adams, the composer of operas such as Nixon in China and Doctor Atomic, to allow his work to be used in a film for the first time and his crashing, arresting, impulsive music is gripping from the start.<br />Its a fitting collaboration. Adams has given modern opera a much-needed shot in the arm and thats what Swinton (who speaks Italian throughout) and Guadagnino are striving to achieve: I Am Love is a brazen blueprint for a cinema that straddles past and future while worrying little about trends of the present. Its a bold experiment rooted in tradition. It plays like smart opera and looks like a marriage of poetic documentary with classical European drama. Swinton and Guadagnino call it Visconti on acid and thats as good a phrase as any to describe the films intoxicating allure.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Dozens of quality kid-lit staples have been turned into decent-to-drab movies; why should Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzis award-winning series be exempt? Thankfully, the initial outing for the Grace familyrebellious Jared (Highmore); his appeasing twin, Simon (Highmore again); and their bossy sister, Mallory (Bolger)sees the trio getting better screen treatment than, say, Lemony Snickets Gothic rug rats or Philip Pullmans prepubescent heroine. Mark Waters (<i>Mean Girls</i>) retains the recipe of mythological beasties, a magic journal and underage messiah complexes, throwing in the requisite celebrity-voiced CGI creatures (Martin Short and Seth Rogen provide comic relief, while Nick Noltes two-pack-a-day rasp has never been used to better effect). And since childrens fantasy now fulfills the need that fairy tales once did, i.e., helps tots psychologically process the adult world in terms they understand, the film makes sure the storys abandonment issues come full circle.</p><p>But what <i>The Spiderwick Chronicles</i> fails to capture is the sense of pixie-dusted wonderment that makes Black and DiTerlizzis tomes such page-turners. Other than Highmores impressive double-duty act, most viewers will find the film indistinguishable from every other kids-in-pointy-hats adaptation of the past few years. The voice of the novels is lost in translation; whats left is something thats merely by the book. <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Kicks, punches, pratfalls, head smacks, tumbles and free falls galore: A parade of pain dominates <i>Kung Fu Panda,</i> which forgoes the rigors of character development for lazy, bone-crunching mayhem. A few clever lines of dialogue give occasional respite from the cacophony and hint at genuine emotion, but the focus always returns to concussive superficiality.</p><p>The halfhearted attempt at a story focuses on Po (Black), a softheaded, soft-bellied panda who dreams of being worthy enough to battle alongside the Furious Fivenot Grandmaster Flashs rap posse but a quintet of fearsome martial artists. Each hopes to be chosen as the Dragon Warrior, a legendary fighter entrusted with the ancient secrets of the much-heralded Dragon Scroll. A firecracker blunder catapults Po smack into a celebrated selection process, where he becomes the Chosen One. An accident, you say? There are no accidents, calmly insists ancient turtle Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), who apparently invented kung fu and doles out wisdom like fortune cookies.</p><p>The animation veers from dazzling (particularly in an opening sequence deeply indebted to Genndy Tartakovskys wildly superior cartoon saga, Samurai Jack) to merely mechanical, showing only sporadic visual flair but, like much of the movie, otherwise content to revel in its conventional invention.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p><i>Hotel for Dogs</i> is the story of a couple of orphaned kids who take in stray pups and make a home for them in an abandoned New York hotel. You see, the kids feel a kinship with these cast-off mutts because they, too, have no one to look after them. Bighearted social worker Bernie (Cheadle) is doing his best to find Andi (Roberts) and the precocious Bruce (Austin) a good family, but he really screws the pooch when he lands the siblings with foster parents Lois and Carl Scudder (Kudrow and Dillon), a dim-witted couple who intend to form a band and drop their rock manifesto on an unsuspecting world.</p><p>Its a mutt movie more in the spirit of <i>Benji the Hunted</i> than <i>Homeward Bound,</i> but the lack of actors lending their voices to the canine conversations isnt a detrimentthe hounds themselves are very expressive without flat celebrity quips about it being a dogs world. As Benji proved, the human element can be more of a hindrance than a help. The film wouldve been better served, however, if the maudlin human struggles and teenybopper romance had been cut and replaced with a bunch of Shiba Inu puppies rolling around the hotel lobby.

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Wit does not become this DreamWorks-produced 3-D animated feature, which commences with California girl Susan Murphy (Witherspoon) taking a gunk-filled meteorite to the head on her wedding day. Until this point, her problems are pure West Coastshes got a selfish weatherman boyfriend (Paul Rudd) who prizes career over all, and a perpetual yearning to visit Paris (France, not Hilton). But then the space slime turns her into a 50-foot-tall superwoman named Ginormica. Now imprisoned at a secret military base, she seems doomed to while away the years in solitary confinement with various other monsters, like the half-ape/half-fish Missing Link (Will Arnett) and the mad scientist insect Dr. Cockroach Ph.D. (Laurie). That is until an off-worlder named Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) comes to Earth with nefarious plans for domination and a clone army at the ready.</p><p><i>Monsters vs. Aliens</i> reaches the (relative) heights of hilarity only twice. First instance: When the films dim-witted POTUSan amalgam of all the worst aspects of Reagan and Clinton, voiced, natch, by Stephen Colbertcommunicates with an alien cyborg by tinkling Harold Faltermeyers Axel F on the synthetic ivories. Second instance: When the Rogen-essayed living globule B.O.B. one-sidedly romances and breaks up with a neon green Jell-O mold. There are also a few lovingly detailed San Francisco landmarks such as the Golden Gate Bridge, which meets a memorably destructive end. But MvA is mostly a brainless parade of half-baked gags, punctuated by the occasional fourth-wall-breaking effect. Only those who desire a paddleball to the kisser or a face full of Mothra snot need apply.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Joe Berlinger knows the miseries of metal. Working with Bruce Sinofsky, he crafted 2004s <i>Metallica: Some Kind of Monster,</i> a cringeworthy keyhole into the bands backstage therapeutic process. (It felt like high comedy.) Before that, the filmmaking duo tracked a miscarriage of justice involving a trio of teen headbangers convicted of murder; the two resultant exposs were called <i>Paradise Lost</i>a thirds on the way.</p><p>Crude, a rage-making account of corporate colonialism, has Berlinger shifting elementsfrom metal to oiland working solo, something hes done before with confidence. While the injustices of the drilling industry (and the celebs who oppose it) seem well within his purview, theres something a touch plodding about the effort. You wonder if Berlingers yin is better off with Sinofskys yang. The material here is dire: a multibillion-dollar class-action lawsuit filed by Ecuadoreans who contend their Amazonian jungle has been toxified by Chevron. Berlinger intercuts footage of sludgy earth and cancer-stricken families with several compelling characters: a local Ecuadoran lawyer who makes his way into <i>Vanity Fair</i>s Green Issue; a white Upper West Side advocate who shouts down his opponents; a Tilda Swintonesque mouthpiece for corporate interests.</p><p>But with the introduction of Trudie Stylerwhose husband, Sting, kicks off the third act with a Police concerta knottier issue comes into play that Berlinger is way too soft on, namely how stars alter a cause. Its not that Styler or Sting are insincere, but it sure is squirmy seeing our humble Ecuadoran lawyer with a backstage pass slung around his neck. Berlinger is fully invested here, but a little distance might have helped.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Funny things, dreams. Fascinating for the dreamer, but as dull as a late morning in Slough for anybody else, unless, of course, your guide is Freud. Or, as it turns out, Christopher Nolan, the 39-year-old British director of Memento and The Dark Knight, whose solution to the boredom of other peoples dreams is to collide their woozy, ever-changing, upside-down and roundabout nature with the thrust of a fast-paced, men-on-a-mission movie and a startling visual language that mirrors their strangeness. Better still, the dreams preferred by Nolan include images of Paris folding in on itself and a trackless train thundering through a city. The limited, sleepworld excitements of retaking your A levels ad infinitum or forever missing a flight at the airport dont figure here.<br />Nolan throws a perfect storm of stunts, effects, locations and actors at one big idea: that its possible to pilfer ideas from dreams by a process called extraction, which involves hooking yourself up to a drip, falling asleep and entering the world of the subconscious. The holy grail of this process is to reverse it, which is inception, the planting of a new idea in anothers mind. Thats the trick that experts Dom (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt), aided by new recruits Ariadne (Ellen Page) and Eames (Tom Hardy), try to pull off while hopping from Tokyo to Paris to Mombasa. Theyre working for Saito (Ken Watanabe) in pursuit of business magnate Robert (Cillian Murphy), and their motives vary, from financial to intellectual. But DiCaprio has another driver: the memory of his wife Mal (Marion Cottilard) is haunting him and its going to take a lot of psychological spring-cleaning for him to reconnect with that lost world.<br />All hail Nolan for mastering a higher class of mass entertainment. Like all good science fiction, Inception demands we pay serious attention to pure fantasy on the back of strong ideas and exquisite craft  but it also combines fantasy with real observations about our sleeping lives. Like a dream, Nolans film fades swiftly in the light  but while it lasts, it feels like theres nothing more important to decipher.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Indias most intelligent and respected director, Tamilian Ratnams latest bilingual (Hindi/Tamil) film is solid and superior Bollywood entertainment. The bastard Beera (Bachchan) kidnaps the arrogant and fearless Ragini (Rai-Bachchan), wife of no-nonsense cop Dev (Vikram). On one level, the plot is dosa-thin: will Dev rescue Ragini safely? But this is a modern update on the revered Hindu epic Sanskrit text The Ramayana (c.300 BC). Ratnams characterisation kicks in after the first chase and thrills hour, giving us a feisty female protagonist who has to question her perception of her captor as either raavan (demon) or Robin Hood. Performances attract admiration, Oscar-winner A R Rahmans energetic rustic tunes charm and the cinematography of a monsoonal rural India is stunning. Unlike its mythological evil namesake, this Raavan is ravishingly good.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ferenc Molnar's play <i>Liliom</i> had already been filmed by Fritz Lang (in France) and Frank Borzage (in Hollywood) when Rodgers and Hammerstein adapted it for their Broadway musical, and here Henry King is content to defer to his betters and simply stand back while the schmaltzy material is overwhelmed by Fox opulence. MacRae is the former fairground barker given celestial leave to visit his loved ones on earth for a day, and incidentally revealing the source of a million Kop anthems with 'You'll Never Walk Alone'.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Among Ozu's best-loved films in Japan is this touching saga of filial love set against adverse circumstances and social duty. Although only 38 at the time, Ryu ages gracefully through decades as a widowed mathematics teacher parted initially from his only son when a fatal boating accident on a school trip causes the father to resign his post, leaving the boy to continue his studies. Their paths remain separate when the latter's own teaching career takes him to Akita in the north, even though his father is now a successful company man in Tokyo. Ozu displays a Renoir-like understanding of both sides, as the brief holiday time the two spend together proves precious indeed - look for the symbolic harmony in the fly fishing scenes. The issue of separation acquired a particular poignancy in wartime, it goes without saying, but Ryu's stoic underplaying offers a heartbreaking performance for the ages.]]></review>

Evil penguins, posh British chimps and an bercamp despot (Baron Cohen) all hijack the limelight as deftly as they did in the original. You cant fault DreamWorks for including what Disneys animated tales conspicuously leave outgags pitched at adults. Plus, the CGI has improved since the first film, with animal fur being ruffled in all the right places.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>He used to be a king, Olivia (Shahidi) says of her dad, Evan (Murphy), in the opening moments of <i>Imagine That</i>. King of what? Nowhereland. Which is to say Evans a harried financial executive, and this is another loathsome family comedy in which a busy father is made to feel like a horrible parent until he abandons earning money and conforms to his childs every whim. This kind of ritual castration is a mainstay of such kid-friendly fare, and it has extra venom here given the current financial meltdown (unmentioned but unavoidable).<br /></p><p>The plothigh-concept whimsy wherein Olivias blanket and imaginary friends give awesome financial advice, bringing Evan closer to his daughter when he reaps the benefit of their wisdomis no big deal. Youngsters will probably be fine with Eddie Murphys unamusing mugging and Hakuna matata quoting; for dads, its undoubtedly grating that the big meeting is always scheduled against the school concert. Responsible parenting is apparently the willingness to look like an idiot in public and driving recklessly to make it to school on time. Only Thomas Haden Church emerges with any credit, as a shifty Native American adviser who thanks investors for letting me bring my venison to your potlatch.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Yip Wai-shuns biopic about Bruce Lees martial arts mentor takes plenty of liberties with the facts but none that cant be forgiven in the name of kungfu kickin fun. Donnie Yen (above) delivers a charismatic portrayal of Ip Man, the martial arts master of the title. We first catch him facing off a group of thugs as he pulls off defensive combos of such skill that hes soon the talk of his town.<br />The first part of this likeable actioner sticks to the age-old kung fu template of poor acting and ridiculous fight-scene sound effects. But it takes a darker turn when, in 1937, the town is besieged by Japanese troops and everyone has to beg for work. Will Ip Man take up the offer of a Japanese officers clemency in exchange for teaching his troops? Yips film benefits from crisp cinematography and an engaging Seven Samurai-style storyline, but its Sammo Hungs superbly choreographed kick-ass fight scenes that dazzle.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its 1959, West Texas: the sun is beating down and the sheriffs deputy, Lou Ford (Casey Affleck), is padding the quiet, widescreen streets of smalltown Central City like a model law enforcer, courteous and polite to the passing citizenry and neat in his blouson, tie and  the Southerners sacred badge of down-home decency  kidskin boots and wide-brim Stetson. But, hes walking through Jim Thompson country  the dissembling, rotten home ground of the nihilistic pulp novelist from whose shocking 1952 novel Michael Winterbottom has fashioned his first American movie  and nothing is as it first appears.<br /><br />The sarcastic faux banalities Lou offers people he meets, for his own light amusement, may betray a more complicated mind than the handsome young detective likes to make plain. Hes also shouldering a tragic past involving a lost brother-in-law which in-the-know locals (including union man Elias Koteas), the city fathers (including Ned Beatty), his secret long-term girlfriend Amy (Kate Hudson) and fellow police colleagues (including Tom Bowers sheriff) happily connive in keeping buried. But few realise that the man is a walking timebomb. However, the day soon comes when hes sent to chase off a local prostitute, the beautiful and fiery Joyce (Jessica Alba), and receives the slap that is to trigger in him an explosion of unexpected passion, intricate deceit and murderous self-destruction<br /><br />The film arrives on screens heralded by some box-office-boosting bad publicity, with shockwaves emanating from some who have witnessed the films face-pulverising, hard-to-stomach bouts of violence. Yet this again-atypical film from Winterbottom, the genre-swapping director of A Mighty Heart, Genova and The Road to Guantanamo, is a much more sober affair than its early, controversial press might suggest. <br />Faithful  awfully  to Thompsons devils-rsum-style source text and despairing worldview, it also occupies an emotional space of unnerving calm. The unfussy, if lazily expressive, cinematography (by Winterbottom regular Marcel Zyskind) of familiar 50s Americana, the unobtrusive set design of jail, courthouse and Texan home, and the relaxed, cowpoke-paced editing are all in concert with it. Together they produce a dirge-like accompaniment to a hypnotic and remarkable central performance by Affleck. <br />With his other Ford (movie-stealing coward Robert in Andrew Dominiks retro-western The Assassination of Jesse James) and his terrific turn as the Boston cop in his older brothers underrated Gone Baby Gone, the younger Affleck is arguably becoming the most compulsively watchable American actor of his generation. Hes capable of saving a pretentious film (The Assassination), giving a spine to a potentially diffuse one (Gone Baby Gone) and, as here, giving a sense of mystery and plaintive spirituality to a movie that would otherwise seem underpowered and uncertain of its own moral purpose or profundity. There are other good performances to enjoy  notably from Koteas and Alba  but its Affleck who justifies the price of your ticket.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Minnelli's last musical before <i>On a Clear Day You Can See Forever</i>, and like it a curate's egg. The two stars are a pleasure to behold, particularly the genially dizzy Holliday, a telephone answering-service operator who can't help involving herself in the lives and hopes of her clients. And old Mr Nonchalance Martin sidles through his part as a doubting, drunken playwright with his customary charm. But their material just isn't up to the mark: Betty Comden and Adolph Green's script involves much jaded satire of jaded topics like Method acting, pop music and smart parties, while Jule Styne's infrequent songs don't really get the bells ringing. Something is also wrong with Minnelli's presentation, for the action tends to hang inside the 'Scope frame looking theatrical and inert; even the location stuff seems phony.]]></review>

As plot loses importance and parody reigns supreme, Falk and Maggie Smith get the best lines. However, unlike <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i> - so stylised as to be virtually a parody - here director Moore and writer Neil Simon seem to have no real affection for either the characters they plunder mercilessly for laughs, or the locked room puzzle they turn on its head.

Less investigative thriller than an investigation of that genre's conventions - voyeurism (looking at, and for, Laura), a search for solutions (not just whodunit but whodunwhat), and the race against time (clues and clocks, fantasies and flashbacks) - the plot is deliberately perfunctory, the people deliciously perverse, and the <i>mise-en-scne</i> radical.

      <review><![CDATA[Not so much a sequel, more a self-parodic reprise, like some black comic nightmare in the damaged brain of sole survivor Ash (Campbell). This time though, tired of cowering in the corner, Ash gets tooled up with a shotgun and a chainsaw, and lets the monsters suck on some abuse. Meanwhile, four other victims - none of whom has ever seen a horror movie - arrive at the shack and start settling in, unaware that they'll be dead by dawn. The dialogue has been pared to the bone, the on-screen gore toned down, and the maniacal laughter cranked up to full volume. Using the same breathless pacing, rushing camera movements and nerve-jangling sound effects as before, Raimi drags us screaming into his cinematic funhouse. Delirious, demented and diabolically funny.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[As petty criminal Sailor (Cage) and his lover Lula (Dern) go on the run through a murderous Deep South, fleeing but meeting sleazy oddballs hired by Lula's mom (Ladd) to end their relationship, Lynch evokes a surreal, sinister world a mite too reminiscent of his earlier work: bloody murder, violent sexual passion, kooky kitsch, freaky characters immersed in private fantasies, digressive metaphors, symbols and cultish references, and bizarre humour to lighten the nightmare. This <i>dj vu</i> weakens the film; sometimes the weirdness seems so forced that Lynch appears merely to be giving fans what they expect. But it's churlish to focus on flaws when so much is exhilaratingly unsettling. Even more than a virtuoso shoot-out, two scenes - Stanton tortured by a gang of grotesques, a truly nasty car crash - exemplify Lynch's ability to disturb through carefully contrived atmosphere; while the performances lend a consistency of tone lacking in the narrative (but ever-present in Fred Elmes' fine camerawork). The film, finally, is funny, scary and brilliantly cinematic.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A strictly realistic approach to Ken Kesey's novel confines the horizons of the original into a saner, less delirious tragi-comedy. Set in an insane asylum, the film involves the oppression of the individual, a struggle spearheaded by an ebullient Nicholson, turning in a star performance if ever there was one as he leads his fellow-inmates against the sinisterly well-meaning Nurse Ratched (Fletcher). For all the film's painstaking sensitivity and scrupulous chartings of energies and repressions, one longs for more muscle, which only Nicholson consistently provides.]]></review>

(The unwelcome voyeur violently shuffles off this mortal coil tout de suite.) In Brooklyn, two undercover copsone posing as a hot-dog vendor, the other dressed as Santa Clauschase a suspect and beat information out of him. Whats their connection? A major shipment of heroin thats being smuggled into New York, which will eventually bring the respective parties face-to-face.</p><p>William Friedkins symphony of long, sharp shocks is memorable for any number of sequences: the cat-and-mouse subway game, the ballbusting bar shakedown, a breakneck chase scene that still seems leagues ahead of greatest-ever competitors. Yet the movies most impressive accomplishment is that the unrepentantly brutish, racist lout whod like to urinate on the Miranda rights ends up being the good guy.</p><p>Antiheroes were everywhere in 70s cinema, but Gene Hackman turns Jimmy Popeye Doyle into one of New Hollywoods more interesting walking contradictions. You cringe every time Doyle opens his obscene jokers yap, and yet the righteous, sharklike determination Hackman shows in pursuing Euro-suave villain Fernando Rey keeps the audience on Doyles side.</p><p>Chalk it up to environment, maybe: Dirty Harry Callahan only had to contend with a psycho Frisco hippie, but Doyle is going up against both international horse-pushers and a nightmare version of New York that Pauline Kael dubbed Horror City. You unconsciously cut the guy some slack; the film, however, remains anything but.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A fraught, violent Freudianism stampedes through Charles Schnee's script (adapted from Niven Busch's novel) for Anthony Mann's intense Western - only his second stab at the genre which would bring out his very best qualities: his gritty treatment of physical and mental conflict, his classical intelligence and expressive use of landscape. In comparison, <i>The Furies</i> smacks of primitivism, its central feud between Stanwyck and her cattle baron father Walter Huston being both overwritten and underdeveloped. That said, these two performers are so compelling in their own right that Mann could get away with murder with them on the screen together.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Mann's finest Western casts Stewart as a wagon train leader, guiding a group of settlers through Indian country to the Oregon Territory. Stewart is a man haunted by a secret, his violent past as a Missouri border raider - a past which catches up with him when another former raider (Kennedy) joins the wagon train. The two men are paralleled throughout, Kennedy representing the old violence which may yet erupt in the reformed Stewart, and the whole film is concerned with the testing of Stewart's capacity for change. Continually provoked by his spiky relationship with Kennedy, Stewart is a man who must clarify and reaffirm his new relationship with a peaceful society. Lighthearted comedy, majestic scenery, and superbly handled action are fused into a unifying moral vision which, though it deals with abstractions, always expresses itself through visible actions and tangible symbols.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Reclaiming the American gangster movie after it had been stolen by the Nouvelle Vague, Penn's film was so successful (and so imitated) that it inevitably met with some grudging devaluation. But it's still great: half comic fairytale, half brutal fact, it reflects the essential ambiguity of its heroes (faithfully copied from history and the real-life Barrow gang which terrorised the American South in the early '30s) by treading a no man's land suspended between reality and fantasy. With its weird landscape of dusty, derelict towns and verdant highways, stunningly shot by Burnett Guffey in muted tones of green and gold, it has the true quality of folk legend.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This ends where Scorsese's <i>New York, New York</i> begins, at the height of the big band era in the '40s; and some striking similarities end with the remorseless good nature of the Glenn Miller movie. Allyson beams and twinkles as Miller's practical wife; Stewart, looking remarkably like Miller, is disarmingly eccentric. They make an exemplary American couple, finding the road to success lined with nice friends, swirling <i>Variety</i> headlines, and key moments like Glenn saying to wife (long-distance), 'My number's Pennsylvania 6-5000'. But it works beautifully, especially if you like the music. Musical direction is by Henry Mancini, who abandons his own particular 'sound' for a credible homage to Miller's. Watch for Louis Armstrong leading a jam session on 'Basin Street Blues' in a speakeasy in Harlem, and Frances Langford doing 'Chattanooga Choo-Choo' in a well-boned strapless.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>God's Little Acre</i> completely bypasses its exotic origins in Erskine Caldwell's sensational novel. Instead, Mann and scriptwriter Philip Yordan transform their subject matter to create out of it a study of two 'over-reachers' struggling for control over the destiny of their family. Accordingly, the film is best seen in the light of the treatment of the family in <i>Man of the West</i> and <i>The Fall of the Roman Empire.</i> Ryan, the family's monomaniacal patriarch, has successfully harnessed the energy of his constantly squabbling flock for 15 years into an impossible search for his grandfather's mythic hidden gold. Similarly, Ray's son-in-law is driven by the dream of reinvigorating the homestead (and the valley) by turning the mill-power back on. While the film's resolution - peace and harmony - is impossible to take, the previous 100-odd minutes offer the most concise account of Mann's conception of the power and tensions that lie at the root of family life.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A thriller about a journalist, alerted to the mysterious deaths of witnesses to the assassination of a presidential candidate, who embarks on an investigation that reveals a nebulous conspiracy of gigantic and all-embracing scope. It sounds familiar, and refers to or overlaps a good handful of similar films, but is most relevantly tied to <i>Klute.</i> Where <i>Klute</i> was an exploration of claustrophobic anxiety, <i>The Parallax View</i> is inexorably agoraphobic. Its visual organisation is stunning as the journalist (Beatty) is drawn into an increasingly nightmarish world characterised by impenetrably opaque structures, a screen whited out from time to time, or meshed over with visually deceptive patterns. It is some indication of the area the film explores that in place of the self-revealing session with the analyst in <i>Klute</i>, <i>The Parallax View</i> presents us with the more insecurity-inducing questionnaire used by the mysterious Parallax Corporation for personality-testing prospective employees. Excellent performances; fascinating film.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Fed by comic tributaries perhaps, but Pee-Wee Herman comes over as a delightful original. It's a balancing act, and he doesn't put a '50s preppy white buckskin wrong. He lives in a house which is a Heath Robinsonish turn in itself, and responds to his environment with all the restraint of a streaker in a carwash. A nasty boy steals his beloved bicycle. Pee-Wee gives chase, taking in a lot of America's tourist map and winding up in Hollywood (which buys his adventure, and we see their version too). Dreamlike situations hover on the edge of unease (a meeting with a waitress in the mouth of a model dinosaur, pursuit by her giant boyfriend waving a caveman's bone), and there's a wonderfully sustained gag in which Pee-Wee rescues animals from a burning pet shop, nervously stalling the snakes. The score works edgily against the comedy, and the dream sequences are just this side of Dali. Pee-Wee himself comes from the school of acting that usually sits under a bubble - Rage, Foiled, Idea - in a cartoon. Truly weird and wonderfully addictive.]]></review>

Glenn Ford, the perfect embodiment of these qualities, returns from Korea, only to be pulled into the murderously destructive marriage between Grahame and Crawford (both superb). The bleak, dark marshalling yards are the perfect backdrop for the playing out of adulterous relationships where 'desire' signifies only fear, jealousy and hatred.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A magnificent, if slightly over-ambitious Western. Cattle baron Crisp, who is going blind, is obsessed with who will inherit his ranching empire: his psychopathic natural-born son Nicol, or the more reliable Kennedy, adopted by the old man to keep Nicol in line. Into this morass of sibling rivalry bursts a vengeful Stewart, bent on finding the gunrunner responsible for selling weapons to the Indians who slaughtered his younger brother's cavalry detachment. Visually impressive, psychologically complex and sometime brutally violent, it suffers slightly from the emphasis on the familial machinations at the expense of Stewart's tortured psyche. Otherwise, it's 24 carat stuff.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A superb Western, exemplifying Mann's capacity for integrating his interest in spectacle with a resonant narrative fully deserving the adjective 'classic', in which Gary Cooper's ex-outlaw is under constant, ranting pressure from Cobb's gang-leader father-figure to return to the fold. The odyssey of Cooper (playing the emblematically named Link Jones) from pasture to desert to ghost town and back, and from settled present to tormented past and back, bridges the traditions of classical tragedy and classic Hollywood. Mann's synthesis of archetypal characters and generic iconography is seamless; and he manages to inscribe landscape, anxious voyeurism and fratricide within his narrative resolution. Textbook cinema, maybe, but Mann's work will remain rich for discovery and celebration.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Scripted by Dudley Nichols, a Western in the traditional mould, much more predictable than Mann's marvellous series with James Stewart, and a little too overtly didactic in detailing the relationship between a disillusioned sheriff turned bounty-hunter (Fonda) and the young greenhorn (Perkins) to whom he becomes a father-figure, teaching him the hard facts of a lawman's life and regaining his self-respect in the process. But Mann directs with an impressive classical elegance, and the performances are fine, even if (as David Thomson remarked) 'Fonda and Perkins look like business executives dressed up in cowboy togs'.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>With all the giddy, giggly energy of a ten-year-old girls slumber party (and roughly the same aesthetic self-discipline), Mamma Mia! practically dares you to criticize it, only to laugh in your faceand, presumably, all the way to the bank. From the breathless opening, in which bride-to-be Sophie (Seyfried, as cheery and full-throated as anyone from <i>High School Musical</i>) sends wedding invitations to each of the three men who might be her father, the cast jumps around a gorgeous Greek island, bursting into some of the most hooky pop songs ever written. (Just try to get through this review without Waterloo taking over your internal soundtrack.)</p><p>The spectacle of Meryl Streep, one of the most lauded actors of her generation, crawling around a roof in overalls singing the title song is a bit jarring, but damned if she doesnt throw herself into it with gusto. As her former backup singers, Julie Walters and Christine Baranski arent given enough to do; apparently Pierce Brosnans license to kill includes songs. Phyllida Lloyds direction is a study in middling success, with missed opportunities at every turn. But who cares? This movie isnt just unapologetic fluff; its aggressive, out-loud-and-proud fluff. Just like ABBA.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The years 3-D deluge continues: <i>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</i> is an amusingly loopy kids meal about a small-town inventor who becomes famous thanks to a machine that causes clouds to rain food. With his remote island communitys sardinecentric economy teetering on the brink of collapse, outcast scientist Flint Lockwood (Hader) ostensibly saves the day when his latest contraption, which genetically mutates water into snacks, unexpectedly takes up residence in some cumulonimbuses and starts producing cheeseburger showers and ice-cream snowfall. Despite the ensuing media attention, which is spearheaded by a perky weather girl (Faris) who yearns to embrace her suppressed inner geek, Flint soon learns that bigger isnt always better. <br />That message, however, doesnt extend to director Phil Lord and Chris Millers boisterous, anything-goes approach to humor, nor to their chow-tastrophic set pieces, whichespecially in a ridiculous reaction-shot montagesharply parody disaster flicks. Driven by an idiosyncratic blend of goofiness and sweetness, <i>Cloudy</i> serves up vibrant animation in tune with its spirit of rollicking comedic abandon, all while championing nerdy intelligence over bland conformity and gastronomic moderation over supersized gluttony. It may not have the heart or subtle artistry of <i>Up,</i> but then again, Pixars 3-D outing didnt feature a mustache-tearing monkey, a manchild encased in a giant cooked chicken, or a beefy, bounding cop voiced by Mr. T. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Just as the 2007 documentary on the Apollo moon landings In the Shadow of the Moon struck a blow against all the crackpot theorists who thought Buzz, Neil and the other guy were actually doing their floaty moonwalk thing in a disused seed barn in Delaware, posthumous concert film Michael Jacksons This Is It will come as a revelation to all those expecting to see the self-spun King of Pop as a spindly, lethargic fantasist whose performing stamina was generated from the noxious vapours of whatever prescription pain killers he happened to have been mainlining at the time.<br />Undoubtedly  and unashamedly, perhaps  the film is cash-in propaganda of Riefenstahlian proportions... but to be honest, its all the more riveting and emotionally rewarding for it. Here we have a no-frills eulogy for Jackson the performer and artist - with all the reams of dodgy courtroom footage, the ruinous tabloid splashes and any enquiry into his dubious private life kept at arms length, perhaps being saved for a different, more damning portrait of one of the world's most enigmatic celebrities. <br />Indeed, its a film thats been methodically purged of any ill feeling and negativity: the fact that he died isnt even mentioned, which gives you some idea of just how desperate the makers of the film are to transport you to Jacksons gooey-eyed Neverland where nothing bad ever happens. Yet, they do somehow succeed, and that helps the audience maintain its focus on the rousing and pleasingly stripped-back renditions of tracks plucked from Jacksons venerable back catalogue. <br />All the classics are here, and not only are we able to see intimate footage of Jackson rehearsing but we also get a preview of the bespoke films and stunts that were set to accompany each song. Thriller is backed by a 3D graveyard scene with various heavily made-up ghouls dancing from their tombs. The Way You Make Me Feel opens on a huge backdrop of workers descending from a scaffold at daybreak and is accompanied by a languid, Gershwin-esque prelude with which Jackson tries to emulate the sound of getting out of bed. Hes even spliced into a bullet-time-enhanced Humphrey Bogart movie for the introduction to Smooth Criminal.<br />Beyond the music, though, there is interest to be had from the between-song footage of Jackson conversing with his many adoring collaborators. When complaining that his earpiece is too loud, he descends into a kind of infantile gibberish where he dances around the issue with bizarre abstracts (Im being punched in the ear!) and the crew all duly respond to his mithering in the sickeningly fawning tone that might be offered to a puppy with a thorn in its paw. Its patently obvious that Jackson had surrounded himself with a cadre of slathering yes-men, which helps you understand why he might have been trapped (perhaps willingly?) in a state of arrested development.<br />But this is a concert film, and, as such, its utterly engaging from beginning to end. Of course, there are those who believe that this 50-date concert engagement was one big insurance scam, and that Jackson faked his own death so he could sup mai tais on a private beach in the Cayman Islands while counting the money as it rolled in like the waves. The unquestionable amount of love and craftsmanship that went into this performance puts that theory into heavy disrepute. For sheer what-could-have-been tragedy, this is one to file next to the Elviss 68 Comeback Special.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Acclaimed as one of the best Irish playwrights of his generation,
Conor McPherson has earned his rep as a first-rate dynamo of the theater: He
blesses his damaged characters with the gifts of gab and profundity,
and in works like <i>The Seafarer</i>, the writer has brilliantly
combined Celtic variations on psychological realism with supernatural
elements. Which makes you wonder if theres another Conor McPherson
lurking out there, a filmmaker who coincidentally shares the name and
obsessions of the Tony-nominated artist. How else to explain this
surprisingly stillborn, tone-deaf drama thats attributed to such a
monumental talent? That, or some McPhersonesque apparition is playing a
cruel trick.</p><p>Having recently lost his wife, Michael (Ciaran Hinds) works
through his grief while shepherding a boorish best-selling writer
(Aidan Quinn) around a local arts festival. The two compete for the attention
of a female novelist (Iben Hjejle)the middle-aged mourner passively, the
asshole author aggressivelywith the occasional vengeful specter
spooking Michael in his sleep. (The only thing scarier than bloodied
spirits aregasp!egomaniacal literary superstars.) Any subtlety that
Hinds, an actor who already looks perpetually haunted, brings to his
role is counteracted by Quinns gorging on scenery. But whats worse is
that, unlike McPhersons stage work, <i>The Eclipse</i> never finds
a common ground between the fantastic and the heartfelt. Such
unintegrated flip-flopping between a muted character study and a horror
flick relying on cheap scare tactics leaves you feeling mildly
schizophrenic; its a movie whose meanings and points are as obscured
as its title suggests.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For those who like the tone of their films to be reflected in the hairstyles of their lead actors, the wayward shock of auburn-red frizz worn by Sabine Azma in Wild Grass is a good first step to unravelling this joyfully skittish farce from 88-year-old maestro Alain Resnais. Combining the verbose theatrical games of his 80s films with the time, space and character manipulations of early classics such as Last Year at Marienbad, Wild Grass also feels like Resnaiss ode to something like Twin Peaks  a work which is inviting and gentle on the surface but inscrutable and strange the more you look at it. <br />Its based on a surreal novel by French author Christian Gailly called LIncident and details the fallout of a preposterous romance that forms between antisocial house husband Georges Palet (Andr Dussollier) and dentist-cum-budding aviatrix, Marguerite Muir (Azma) when her purse is snatched and he recovers it. Every frame is filled with blushed neon hues that look like theyve been filmed through a smear of Vaseline. The kinetic camera hovers and glides around scenes, at one point even leaping over the top of a house. These stylistic elements  along with a dainty, midi-jazz score  lend the film a dreamlike quality. Whats it all about, though? It could be everything and nothing. There are allusions to psychosis, chaos, reincarnation, anxiety, communication and even the romanticised nature of cinema itself. Its cheeky and confident, maybe one of the directors finest, and its loopy final line is the cryptic cherry on this oddball gteau.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A big budget, San Francisco-set comedy thriller, with Goldie Hawn playing self-contained kook Gloria Mundy. A significant name, since the deliberately ridiculous plot involves an attempt to murder the pontiff. (Or is it because Hawn's a little too well-worn in this kind of role, sic transit Gloria Mundy?) Unsatisfactory as a whole, the film is hilarious and tense in bits. For while writer/director Higgins uses almost every stock thriller device - sinister dwarf, albino, scarfaced man, moving shower curtain, disappearing corpses, a chase, an escape or two, even the identical twin wheeze - he approaches this semi-parody with more zest and originality than is common, and careers from farce to thrills before you can say 'Spot the hommage'.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Virtually a lost film, this picked up a prize at the Sundance festival and earned some critical raves, but when Warners acquired the rights with a view to remaking it, they didn't bother to distribute the shoestring original - according to the writer/director/star, they actively suppressed it (it's never been released in the UK, even on video). It's flawed but often brilliant, one of the most provocative and adventurous American movies of the '90s. Harris is Douglas Street, a kind of professional black Zelig, who successfully passes himself off as a reporter, an exchange student, a lawyer and even a surgeon without any relevant qualifications. Formally adventurous, very funny, and deeply sour. Incredibly, it's based on a true story.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
The last half-hour of Aardman's first feature is pretty much all one might expect. But as far as laughs go, it's slow to take off; and in terms of gags, characters and narrative, it lacks the freshness of some of the earlier films. This is <i>The Great Escape</i> with chickens, and herein lie the limitations. First, the fowl are neither as funny nor as well characterised as Gromit and Co. Furthermore, directors Park and Lord are so keen to get the PoW format pat that the film comes across as pastiche not parody. As Ginger tries to persuade Rocky, a Rhode Island Red, to help her fellow egg-layers escape from Tweedy's Farm (where a barbaric pie machine is being built) familiarity with the stereotypes may produce pleasure of recognition, but not consistent laughter. Still, it'd be churlish to carp about this triumph of craftsmanlike technique.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Lee's first feature focuses around the attempts of Nola Darling (Johns), aware but not ashamed of her reputation as a good-time girl, to sort out the three steady men in her life with a view (maybe) to marriage: the sincere and caring Jamie (Hicks), the self-obsessed model Greer (Terrell), and the outrageous bicycle messenger Mars (Lee). Each lover, convinced that he is the solution to Nola's problem, makes his prospective pitch (to the girl and audience alike) in a series of painfully funny character vignettes. The action centres on Nola's spacious Brooklyn studio, where the men take it in turns to assassinate each other's characters, before gathering round Nola's Thanksgiving table to do it face-to-face. Structurally, it could be compared to Kurosawa's <i>Rashomon</i> for its subjective cross-examination of Nola's loves; but this delightful low-budget comedy, with its all black cast and black humour, is 100 per cent Lee.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This is the original version of the story about rebellious kids who feel betrayed by their father that Ozu remade as <i>Ohayo</i> thirty-seven years later. <i>I Was Born, But...</i> doesn't have the later film's oscillations between comedy and a tragic sense of defeat; rather, it begins as a particularly riotous comedy, and then abruptly switches to a darker tone when the boys lose their respect for their father. It's silent (Ozu resisted talkies until 1935), but its visual style is so dynamic that you hardly notice; both the gags and the emotional disappointments are anchored in a sure sense of characterisation that remains wholly fresh, and the pace of the whole film is worthy of Buster Keaton at his best.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A marvellous, highly influential <i>cinma-vrit</i> examination of a specific time and place: Paris in May 1962, going through its first spring of peace since 1939 (the signing of the Evian agreement in March 1962 having finally put an end to the long-running Algerian troubles). The basic method is simple: Marker and his colleagues (unseen) elicit comments on work, money, happiness, etc, from a cross-section of Parisians. But these personal thoughts are firmly and evocatively placed within a wider socio-political context, as the film proceeds to show footage of police charges, rioters, strikers, and so forth. What distinguishes the film most, however, is its wit, both verbal and visual, so that it is simultaneously illuminating and funny. (The film was cut under Marker's supervision from the original 180 minutes to 123 minutes.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Three middle-aged actresses, former disciples of a legendary diva, reunite to mull over their loves, lives, differences and similarities. This Catalan feature, from a play by JM Benet i Jornet, is unimaginatively directed and betrays its stage origins at every turn. It also looks as if made for TV. Solid but less than remarkable performances.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Of all Spike Lees considerable gifts, its his ear for dialogue thats best served him through a spotty ten years. Plots and polemics have grown tired (<i>She Hate Me</i>), but the cop-perp patter of <i>Inside Man</i> had a convincing bristlepure directorial toughnessas did the borough-steeped profanities of <i>Summer of Sam</i> and <i>25th Hour.</i> The strongest idea Lees had in a while was to simply go down to New Orleans and listen, for <i>When the Levees Broke.</i></p><p>In this regard, <i>Miracle at St. Anna</i> is a huge letdown. You can easily see what Lee was going for: an honorable corrective to Hollywoods longtime WWII sentimentalizing, expanding the frame to include underrepresented black servicemen, the buffalo soldiers.</p><p>But the conventional solutions arrived at by novelist and scripter James McBride (along with an uncredited Lee) are actually worse than those in John Wayne movies, neutralizing Lees talent for earthy anxieties. The movies Tuscan-trapped band of partisans and U.S. soldiers includes a gentle simp of a teddy bear, Pfc. Train (Miller); a precocious, leg-clinging Italian orphan (Sciabordi) who calls Train his chocolate giant; and a hotcha local babe with a shirt-buttoning problem (Valentina Cervi).</p><p>If stinging neorealist emotions were his goal, Lee would have been wise to reduce his scope, at least by chopping the useless 1980s bookends and generic racist-diner flashback. Moreover, this director remains extremely uncomfortable in period, mixing modern slang with chest-thumping earnestness (Makes me ashamed to be more free in a foreign country). Meanwhile, histrionic composer Terence Blanchard seems to think hes scoring the new James Bond movie. Lees war lacks a battle plan, not good intentions.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The first <i>Twilight </i>film turned tween girls into obsessives, so this sequels theme should make perfect sense: romantic and sexual OCD. When pallid, principled vampire Edward Cullen (Pattinson) reluctantly leaves town, chaste girlfriend Bella (Stewart) sulks and mourns for months. Then solace arrives in the bulging biceps of Jacob (Lautner), her Native American childhood friend turned hunky hulk.</p><p>Its not exactly a celebration of female independence, but<i> New Moon </i>still has a handle on its young-adult audience: Hormonal frustration runs amok, and boys become attractive yet dangerous when they come of age (only the good ones keep their monsters in check). This time, we get not just vampires but werewolves, toospectacular CG creatures that snarl and pounce before transforming back into buff, topless young studs. </p><p>Bella sees action too, when she develops a taste for adrenaline in the hope of catching a glimpse of her plasma-sucking protector. Motorbike rides and deathly dives follow, along with a scenic race to Italy to meet an bervampire (Michael Sheen). At one point, a character wearily deconstructs zombie-cinema symbolism while bemoaning the lack of hot guys. Is this sequel defending its fan base and preempting criticism about its transparent agenda? This is a soap opera, folksand acceptable escapism for those old enough to see it yet still young enough to shriek at undead dreamboats.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[I hope your kids have bad influences and develop bad personalities, says the well-to-do dad of three suburban young adults as a putdown in the mysterious, bold Dogtooth, hinting at a unique approach to parenting of which Josef Fritzl would be proud. Director Giorgos Lanthimos gives us a middle-class Greek family, lorded over by a businessman father who keeps his three children within the walls of their smart home and teaches them the incorrect definitions of several new words each day (A motorway is a very strong wind). These kids world is without outside interference: when their mother talks on the phone, they think shes speaking to herself; when planes fly over, they think theyre toys. Perhaps the dads biggest mistake is to allow a security guard from work to enter their home and sexually satisfy his son. He doesnt bargain on her trading gifts and ideas with his daughter for sexual favours. Nor does he pre-empt the danger of her lending his daughter videos of Rocky and Flashdance.<br />With hints of Hanekes The Seventh Continent, Ian McEwans The Cement Garden and even Lord of the Flies, Lanthimos has crafted a stunningly provocative and at times witty play on the inspirations that make us who we are. All families live by their own rules, and this drama takes that idea to its perverse and shocking conclusion. Lanthimos films these calamities in a quiet, observational style, with calm colours, subtle camera movements and gentle edits, lending an air of normality to a world that couldnt be less so. Special and troubling.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>It turns out that the battle between good vampires and bad vampires all comes down to hair. Eternally 17 vamp dreamboat Edward Cullen (Pattinson) has a hypnotic head of honey-colored locks that makes him look like James Dean after an aggressive application of volumizer. Evil vamp James (Gigandet) wears his blond tresses in a badass-biker ponytail. Good bloodsuckers use styling product; bad ones dont. And good hair, pasty skin, a lot of brooding and inexplicable mood shifts are catnip to Bella (Stewart), the new girl in perpetually overcast Forks, Washington. Shes drawn to Edward, even when he admits that his first urge upon meeting her is to drink her dry. Shes totally ready for that, but hes trying to save her from her own desires. Do you sense a twisted sexual metaphor at work?<br /></p><p>Catherine Hardwicke (<i>Thirteen</i>) seems most invested in examining Bellas teen-girl lust, captured with the directors usual sympathy for the pubescent perspective. She seems less assured when it comes to the supernatural aspects, and the climactic chase and battle feel rushed and perfunctory. But her earnest, moody approach to Stephenie Meyers tremendously popular novel may be just the thing for the 14-year-old girl in all of us.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A strange, almost self-conscious Western written, like <i>Where the River Bends</i>, by Borden Chase. Stewart travels north to the Oregon territory with old-timer Brennan and a herd of cattle, only to be cheated out of the steers by corrupt judge McIntire. Signing up with saloon owner Roman's wagon-train to the gold-mining camps, ostensibly to earn some money, Stewart in fact plans to steal back his cattle and take his revenge. Stewart again plays the driven, vengeful loner, and the emphasis is again on his eventual acceptance of a social rather than an individual sense of justice. What distinguishes this from <i>Where the River Bends</i>, though, is Mann's use of painted backdrops, rear-projections and other artificial devices which tend - like the odd, cryptic dialogue - to undermine any sense of realism.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Led by Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (Malkovich), a dozen jailbirds hijack a transport plane. Only parolee Cameron Poe (Cage) - caught up in the middle - stands between the worst of the worst and their freedom. Scott Rosenberg's ingeniously tooled script recalls such vintage entertainments as <i>The Dirty Dozen</i> and <i>The Great Escape</i>. Dialogue is pared to bullet points, punctuation between spectacular set-pieces, but Rosenberg makes every word count. If it needs strong actors to flesh out the characterisation, so be it: Rhames, Buscemi, Trejo - faces you don't forget in a hurry. Sometimes skin deep is close enough. Commercials director West gives us the hard sell non-stop for 115 ear-splitting minutes. There are misjudgments. He gets off on male flesh rippling against slow motion fireballs, and has no time for women, but throws in a transvestite for cheap jibes. The climax looks like an afterthought, and in trying to top itself, the movie finally goes OTT. Very cool, but also very cold.]]></review>

The fact that Anthony Mann had an uncredited hand in the direction may have something to do with the successful creation of a tense atmosphere, although most notable is the superb <i>noir</i> photography by John Alton, who really comes into his own during the final chase through the LA sewers. Basehart is excellent as the strange, lone wolf electronics expert/killer, an enigmatic threat haunting the paranoid dreams of the witch-hunting era.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When career girl Allie (Fonda) learns that her lover Sam (Weber) has slept with his ex, she turfs him out and advertises for a flatmate. Successful applicant Hedy (Leigh) may not seem particularly mature, but who would expect her to start dressing up in Allie's clothes, moving in on Sam, and generally making life hell for the landlady she professes to adore? Actually, anyone who's seen a few movies would expect Hedy to do precisely those things, especially given the heavy-handed way Schroeder signposts the imminent homicidal carnage right from the start (stay out of that laundry room!). If his two leads are adequate to the slick mechanisms of a formulaic thriller, neither they nor Don Roos' script (based on the novel by John Lutz) offer any original insights into insatiable emotional dependence.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Co-scripted by Philip Yordan - who wrote <i>Johnny Guitar</i> as well as Mann's two great epics, <i>El Cid</i> and <i>The Fall of the Roman Empire</i> - this is a French Revolutionary drama made on the lines of Mann's <i>films noirs</i> like <i>T-Men</i>, with atmospheric camerawork by John Alton and ambitious art direction (the producer was William Cameron Menzies, who made <i>Things To Come</i> and designed <i>Gone With the Wind</i>). History is thrown to the wolves as Robert Cummings impersonates a public prosecutor and tries to overthrow the dictatorship of Robespierre (Basehart), whose incriminating 'Black Book' (furnishing the British release title) has been stolen. Historians will scoff and the casting is hardly French, but on its own terms the movie works very well.]]></review>

Act III: He goes to Russia, trains in the snow, and takes revenge. Never mind that all other characters are reduced to shadows, that the dialogue is witless, that the political message is a heart-warming call for detente.

Hitching a ride is Powell, a New York cop who has wind of an assassination attempt, has resigned from the force because of the scepticism of his superiors, and finds that playing a lone wolf hand with no official backing has its hazards as he does everything in his power to avert disaster. Ingeniously and inventively plotted, taut and unpretentious, the film dashes along at a furious pace, with a strong period feel and nicely understated performances, well served by Mann's straightforward direction.]]></review>

An extraordinary study of trance and spirit posession in which a diverse group of working men from Accra become occupied by the identities of colonial figures, both military and political. Rouch reflects on this ritual, carried out in seclusion and involving the consumption of a dog, as a means of treating mental distress, and its possible to extend this to consider the process, however few might actually take part, as a means by which the larger community comes to terms with the pain of its colonial inheritance.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Both Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis are behind the production of this horror-lite computer animation and the diagnosis is rather good. Monster House centres on a couple of pubescent boys  12-year-old DJ and his chubby pal Chowder  and their fixation with the creepy goings-on at the house across the street. Why is cantankerous old Nebbercracker so aggressively protective of his land, and what ever became of his rotund wife? With the aid of a quick-thinking girlfriend, the youngsters set out to solve the creepy conundrum in typically innocent childhood fashion. Elements of Rear Window are evident in the scenario, while the script is both cleverly structured and, for a kids film, surprisingly coherent. Its also very funny, exciting, often scary, imaginatively characterised and graced with some decent voice-overs, especially that of Steve Buscemis old man. In the pantheon of CGI films, its one of the most adult-orientated animations yet. I dont need to tell you that the kids in the screening were enamoured from start to finish.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[More concert movie than laugh-fest, this is a spirited chronicle of a day-long hip hop event that comedian Dave Chappelle organised on a Brooklyn street corner in September 2004. Chappelles idea is to take hip hop back to its roots, bypassing commerce and giving a voice to artists whose controversial lyrics are seldom heard on commerical radio. We watch Chappelle and friends as they rehearse for the event, dish out free tickets to both young and old and gather an impressive line-up of artists from the more soulful, conscious side of hip hop, including Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Dead Prez, Erykah Badu, The Roots, Common and Kanye West. Chappelle keeps things lively, joking on camera, punctuating the acts with gags , while Michel Gondry maintains our interest, focusing as much on Chappelles energy and wit, and goings-on behind the scenes, as the gig itself. Gondry lets himself meander, for example interviewing a pair of crazy old hippies who live near to the makeshift stage or focusing on the Ohio school band hired by Chappelle. The music wins out, though, not least when the Fugees perform together for the first time in ages.]]></review>

But this is the first time theyve spun a near-feature-length  but still low, low budget  effort from their between-film doodlings and its an endearing effort with enough heart to fill the gaps where the gags dry up or fall flat. They shot the whole thing in just five days around a real Arctic Monkeys gig at Old Trafford, where Le Donk takes his charge  real-life rapper Scor-Zay-Zee  to perform in a support slot and tries to hog the gig himself. Meadows directs in faux-doc mode and appears as himself, while Considine continues the volatile, vulnerable act  part macho man, part male loser  that drove his performances in A Room for Romeo Brass and Dead Mans Shoes. When Considine really gets going, hes as funny as hes ever been.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Although the music-only soundtrack would seem to hint at Ozus reluctance to embrace the technical advances of the era, this touching tale of depression-era travails is shot just like a sound picture with intertitles. Thats to say the performances are entirely naturalistic, as Sakamotos unemployed dad wanders in search of a job to feed his two sons, whore reduced to catching stray dogs so they can sell them to the municipal pound, thus giving the family the choice of a meal or a bed for the night. Ozu does allow hope to fringe the horizon, but even when the central trio are miming their enjoyment of invisible rice and sak, it never lapses into sentimentality, and the framing of the characters against telegraph poles and industrial chimneys melting into the middle-distance shows some of the directors visual signatures already in place at this relatively early stage. The De Sica-ish storyline makes this one an anomaly in the filmography, but its still beautifully achieved.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Accurately subtitled The Most Famous Woman in America You Never Heard Of, Aviva Kempners well-intentioned portrait of Gertrude Berg continues the directors focus on unsung Jewish-American heroes (<i>The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg</i>). One of the first female hyphenates in the entertainment industry, Berg was the producer-writer-director of <i>The Goldbergs,</i> a sweet-and-schmaltzy TV show thats considered the genesis of the domestic sitcom. Set in a simple Bronx Jewish household, the series had a remarkable run that began on radio in 1929 and ended on the boob tube in 1955. Berg built a media empire around her Molly Goldberg character, becoming a proto-Oprah who lived in the lap of luxury while creatively catering to nearly all corners (and ethnicities) of working-class America.</p><p>Though <i>The Goldbergs</i> found continued success for nearly 30 years (even during the rise of American anti-Semitism), both the show and Berg have fallen into obscurity, something Kempner fails to adequately explore. A tragic episode during McCarthyism is sensitively addressed, but the often repetitive accolades from the talking heads that dominate the doc quickly become tiresome. Bergs talents are unassailable, but a more detailed study of the gender and cultural barriers she encountered might have resulted in the compelling profile this media pioneer deserves.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>A strong contender for this years <i>Man on Wire,</i> this nonfiction potboiler follows filmmaker Louie Psihoyos as he documents the illicit slaughter of dolphins in Taiji, Japan. You [could] try to do the story legally, says the exasperated Psihoyos, as he researches these killings and the lax oversight behind them. But after being stymied by government officials, attacked by fisherman and tailed by the police, the cinejournalist decides to go rogue. </p><p>With the help of Richard OBarry, a former dolphin trainer for the TV show<i> Flipper, </i>Psihoyos recruits other animal-rights renegades to rig hidden cameras in a rural cove. Its no small feat to mount a guerrilla assault on the protective powers that be, especially when the local police are watching your every movebut then very little about this situation seems simple. Psihoyos connects the dots, linking these aquatic massacres to a lucrative aquarium industry (where a live dolphin can net $150,000), ignorant Japanese consumers, an impotent global regulatory system and a rebounding whaling industry. This cove, OBarry says, is the setting for the biggest battle in the war against such ecological crimes. Both the animal activist and the director know that if theyre ever going to slay Goliath, the fight must begin with exposing the bloody secrets of this remote inlet. That, and a rousing call to arms.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The female inmates at Oklahomas State Penitentiary risk life and limb as they train for the Prison Rodeo; one of the last of its kind. Both a liberating time-out from prison monotony and a stomach-churning adrenaline-trip, the Rodeo is also a test of self-belief and physical mettle. Taking more courage to grasp than any bulls horns, its this that finally carries these strong but damaged women back to life on the outside. Smashing through the old divides between documentary and fiction drama, 'Sweethearts...' is a story of gladiatorial desperation and hope, tied up with one whole lot of Oklhahoman heart  Hell yeah!.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The most puzzling of Eastwood's self-directed films, lacking the ironic detachment that characterised his long journey from the Man with No Name to <i>Bronco Billy</i>. Shot in a straightforward adventure style, with Eastwood as the art lecturer cum cold-blooded assassin hired to kill his victim while climbing the North face of the Eiger, the movie is little but a series of nice panoramas and clichd action sequences.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of the very finest epics produced by Samuel Bronston, equally impressive in terms of script (by Philip Yordan, who mercifully steers clear of florid archaisms) and spectacle. Heston is aptly heroic as the 11th-century patriot destined to die in the fight for a Moor-less Spain, Mann's direction is stately and thrilling, and Miklos Rosza's superb score perfectly complements the crisp and simple widescreen images. Sobriety and restraint, in fact, are perhaps the keynotes of the film's success, with the result that a potentially risible finale (in which Cid's corpse is borne into the realm of legend, strapped to his horse as it leads his men to battle) becomes genuinely stirring.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The story of star radio singer and entertainer Jane Froman is the sort of stuff Hollywood would have gladly made up had not reality beaten them to it. Hayward was Froman's choice for the lead (although the singer dubbed her own songs) in this rags-to-riches story, capped by a near-fatal aircrash during WWII, a tough fight-back from illness, and a big finale that has Froman out entertaining the troops again. Hideously schmaltzy and Hayward's not exactly anyone's idea of musical sparkle. But what songs! 'Blue Moon', 'Give My Regards to Broadway', 'Embraceable You', 'Get Happy'. Alfred Newman won an Oscar for musical direction.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Uncredited writer John Milius was thinking of Kurosawa's detective movies, and of outrageous antagonists differentiated only by the badge one wears; director Siegel was thinking of bigotry and, as ever, in terms of questions rather than answers. Critics were immediately thinking of effects ('Every frame votes Nixon'). Siegel's ambiguity wins out, as it had done with <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i> (anti-Red? anti-McCarthy?). Seminal law-and-order cinema, and the site of revival for the oldest cine-political argument of all: does an articulated theme necessarily constitute an ideological position, especially when it's so transparent (cop Callahan's fascism) that it's noticed by everyone who's ever written about the film? It's more than a little embarrassing when critics trust audiences less than film-makers do.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A remarkable film which sets out as a revenge Western: Eastwood sees his family massacred and joins the Confederate guerillas; after the Civil War, he is hunted by Union soldiers while he pursues his family's slayer and a friend apparently turned traitor. But slowly the film changes direction, until through a series of comic interludes it becomes the story of a man who (re)discovers his role as family man, as he befriends Indians and various strays and leads them to a paradise of sorts where they can forget their individual pasts. If that seems like a rewrite of Hawks' <i>Red River</i>, visually <i>The Outlaw Josey Wales </i>is closest to Anthony Mann in its breathtaking survey of American landscapes (and seasons). Most importantly, after a period of directorial uncertainty, the film demonstrated Eastwood's ability to recreate his first starring role, as the mythic Man with No Name of the Italian Westerns, and to subtly undercut it through comedy and mockery.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Though far less operatic and satisfying than Leone's later work, his first spaghetti Western with Eastwood still looks stylish, if a little rough at the edges. Based on Kurosawa's <i>Yojimbo</i>, it set a fashion in surly, laconic, supercool heroes with Eastwood's amoral gunslinger, who plays off two gangs against one another in a deadly feud. All the classic Leone ingredients were there - the atonal score, the graphic violence, the horrendous dubbing - and the film's Stateside success changed the face of a genre.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Eastwood has often been noted for his sudden, surprising and adventurous switches in direction, but none of them (not even <i>Tightrope</i>) is quite as extraordinary as this. For one thing he does not appear in it himself (well, only in a Hitchcock-style shot); for another, the subject matter is hardly what one would associate with 'Dirty Harry'. A middle-aged real-estate broker meets a hippy hitchhiker less than half his age. They fall in love. A project full of pitfalls, all of which Eastwood, remarkably, manages to avoid. The film is sentimental only in that its characters, being human and in love, are sentimental; otherwise the script (by Jo Heims, who also wrote <i>Play Misty For Me</i>) and direction clearly chart the many obstacles facing the pair in terms of age, background, ideals and so on. It's performed beautifully, laced with a quietly ironic wit, and quite lovely to look at.]]></review>

Grant imparts his ineffable charm, Kennedy (with metal hand) provides comic brutality, while Hepburn is elegantly fraught. There are also smart Parisian settings and smart Mancini music. The result has a chic rating of at least 180; and while hardly as sturdy or provoking an entertainment as <i>North by Northwest</i>, say, it remains an entertainment.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA['Big .45 calibre fruit! Macho mentality!' - Eastwood under siege as Sondra Locke leads the assault on his monolithic image. As much comedy as action picture, <i>The Gauntlet</i> mines the vein of humour discovered in <i>The Outlaw Josey Wales</i>: again most of the laughs are at Eastwood's expense. In his most mellow cop role yet, he plays a long-suffering, rather dumb officer who extradites a smart, fast-talking hooker, but ends up hiking her cross country, pursued by mob and cops alike (more identical than alike). The well paced script is an effective mixture of worldliness and navet: despite the couple's graphic sparring scenes, in which Eastwood more than meets his match, their relationship remains curiously innocent; a kind of fugitive romanticism pervades. A major source of amusement is watching Eastwood the director leaving Eastwood the actor barely in control throughout. Eastwood's <i>Annie Hall</i>?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of the oldest Western themes: an enigmatic knight errant rides into town, sides with the poor but decent folk against the robber barons, then rides back to the horizon leaving the West won for the forces of good. This is shot in classical style, with much less of the baroque, mystical flourish which characterised <i>High Plains Drifter</i>. But there are sufficient question-marks inserted to lift it out of the routine: Eastwood's preacher man seems to carry the stigmata of a ghost; and he arrives as the answer to a maiden's prayer. Furthermore, his care for the landscape puts him in the Anthony Mann class. It's good to be back in the saddle again. CPea.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[While this lacks the class and assured blend of genre traditions and subversion that marks Eastwood's best work, it <i>is</i> very entertaining. In some respects, the film looks formulaic: an escaped con (Costner) flees with a child hostage (Lowther), pursued by Texas Ranger Eastwood, criminologist Dern, a trigger-happy FBI sniper and assorted redneck assistants. To an extent, all goes predictably. Costner gets to like the kid, his essential goodness underlined by contrast with the psycho sadist who is briefly his fugitive partner, while Clint's conservative but well-meaning law enforcer discovers a measure of empathy with both the pragmatic Dern and his prey. Among the familiar stuff, however, there are very fine moments. It's just a pity that Costner never really comes alive. That said, the director manages mostly to avoid the enormous maudlin pitfalls of his material, at least until the over-extended final scene. As usual with Eastwood, little is overstated - and the accent is on humour.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Eastwood's first film as director, and first exploratory probe for the flaws in his macho image as outlined in Siegel's <i>The Beguiled</i>. A highly enjoyable thriller made under the influence of Siegel (who contributes a memorable cameo as a bartender), it casts Eastwood as a late-night Californian DJ who, flattered by the persistent attentions of a mysterious fan (Walter), lets himself be picked up for a one night stand before going back to his true love (Mills). Before long, blandly assuming an on-going relationship, Walter reveals herself to be a suicidal hysteric who won't take no for an answer; and poor Eastwood is driven into a corner like a mesmerised rabbit, unable to find a way out of the impasse without driving one of his two jealous women over the edge. From there it's but a step to the watcher in the bushes, the carving knife glittering in a darkened room, and a splendid all-stops-out finale.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[As gravestone inscriptions in the town of Lago (painted red and renamed Hell by the phantom drifter) make clear, this was supposed to be Eastwood's fond adieu to the worlds of Sergio Leone and Don Siegel; and indeed he cuts the operatic excess of the former with the punchy economy of the latter. Yet the way Ernest Tidyman's script is submitted to distortion and distension, and fitted with Bruce Surtees' almost surreal images (and several twists of the ghostly revenge plot itself), suggest nothing so much as Eastwood returning for reference to the popular Japanese cinema from which Leone himself first borrowed for the <i>Dollars</i> films. Whatever, there's a boldness, confident stylisation, and genuine weirdness to the movie that totally escaped other post-spaghetti American Westerns, with a real sense of exorcism running both through and beyond it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of the most oddball and heroically unfashionable superstar vehicles ever contrived. Only Eastwood, with the rest of Hollywood obsessed with taking us up where we belong, could have the audacity to play a comparatively odious and untalented country singer dying of consumption during the Depression. Much of the film is concerned with his picaresque pilgrimage to a Nashville audition along with nephew (played by Eastwood's son) and grandpappy (the excellent McIntire), and it culminates in a last-chance recording session during which the singer nearly coughs himself to death. The whole thing veers wildly in quality, and no Eastwood-hater should go within a mile of it; but few lovers of American cinema could fail to be moved by a venture conceived so recklessly against the spirit of its times.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Quite surprising that Chandler's <i>The Little Sister</i> - if memory serves, the only Marlowe novel to deal at all with the Hollywood film colony - had never been filmed before. This snappy and stylish update is certainly watchable, even if it lacks the definitive status of <i>The Big Sleep</i> (first version) and <i>The Long Goodbye</i>. Garner's rumpled charm is engaging enough as he takes on a missing persons case and finds himself sinking into ever more murky waters, while Paul Bogart's solid direction and some fine supporting performances (particularly O'Connor) help to create an atmosphere of almost universal corruptability. Surprisingly, even the inclusion of some fashionable martial arts - courtesy of Bruce Lee - actually works rather well.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Pasolini's last movie before his being brutally murdered may now seem strangely prophetic of his death, but it is undeniably a thoroughly objectionable piece of work. Transporting De Sade's novel to Mussolini's Fascist republic of 1944, Pasolini observes with unflinching gaze the systematic humiliation and torture of beautiful young boys and girls, herded into a palatial villa by various jaded, sadistic members of the wealthy upper classes. According to the director, the story was meant to be a metaphor for Fascism, but the revolting excesses shown on screen (shit-eating and sexual violence included), coupled with the fact that the victims seem complaisant in, rather than resistant to, their ordeals, suggest murkier motives in making the movie. It's <i>very </i>hard to sit through and offers no insights whatsoever into power, politics, history or sexuality. Nasty stuff.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Since <i>Tommy</i> was Ken Russell's first real commercial hit, it's not surprising that <i>Lisztomania</i> should be a blatant attempt to repeat the formula. But without Pete Townshend behind him, Russell has to fall back on his own notion of a 'rock opera'... which means casting the hapless Daltrey as yet another Messiah and Ringo (ho ho) as the Pope, and hiring Rick Wakeman to play garbled rearrangements of Liszt and Wagner. The result is not only catastrophically wide of the mark as a 'sense experience', but misogynistic, addled and grandiosely witless. The most pitiable aspect is that Russell is here patronising his collaborators as much as he's always patronised his audience.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Theres one particular comic strip in Gary Larsons The Far Side collection that features a herd of cows standing up on their hind legs, discussing vital matters of the day. Cut to frame two where one of them shouts Car! and, in the following frame, theyre all back to grazing on all fours purely for the benefit of us humans. Thats the gist behind this half-baked CGI offering from Nickelodeon; a film that manages to say less in 90 minutes than Larson achieved in three simple panels. The film alights on a primary-coloured farmstead presided over by a chubby farmer who is blissfully unaware that his clichd collection of animals  headed by macho bull Ben  can, in the best traditions of anthropomorphism, all walk and talk. Bens getting on a bit, though, so hes priming his son Otis for leadership. But all Otis wants to do is party. Will Otis ever get his act together? Do we care? The animation here is of the plastic toy variety but thats not the real sin. The real sin is seeing a bull with udders! What the hell is that all about? Aside from a couple of successfully dark moments involving a gang of coyotes, most of this fatuous film is loud, raucous and dispiritingly unfunny.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This slight documentary about ballet dancing Brazilian slum teens is being pitched as the real Billy Elliot, but its a more complex, less satisfying tale than that . These kids arent desperately dancing their way out of the ghetto  in fact, they seem barely aware of their impoverished roots, drifting along in a haze of professional focus and adolescent self-absorption. Which may be great for a ballet dancer, but its tough on an audience: the first rule of documentary must be to find relatable characters, but director Beadie Finzi rarely gets close to her subjects. As a peek into an elite, guarded world, Only When I Dance is fascinating, though its hard to believe professional ballet still unironically employs teenage boys in glitter. Its also a compelling underdog story: however distant these kids seem, you still want them to succeed. Its just a shame Finzi couldnt find a way to get under their skin.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It's no fun being in your early teens, especially if you're none too tall. So thinks Josh Baskin, having been denied a ride on a fairyground superloop. But neither is being a kid in a grown-up body so hot, as Josh discovers after a carnival wishing-machine grants the change overnight. What do you do when Mom doesn't recognise you, and thinks you're your own abductor? How do you get a job when you can't drive and have no social security number? And when you do find work with a toy-design company, how do you cope with board meetings, office rivalries, and swish staff parties? Marshall's movie may be a mite predictable, but it's genuinely funny, thanks partly to Hanks' engagingly gauche and gangly performance as the overgrown Josh, and partly to a script that steers admirably clear of gross innuendo. Much of the humour derives from Josh's inability to comprehend adult life; much of its charm from the way his forthright innocence steadily revitalises those around him. Admittedly, this latter theme makes for an ending oozing with saccharine sentiment; but until then Marshall, Hanks, and his co-stars seldom put a foot wrong.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A disco movie for people who don't go to discos, this is really about Growing Up - which the movie interprets as Growing Out of a Disco Mentality and into Personal Relationships. The relationship between Tony (Travolta) and Stephanie (Gorney) is at least as angst-ridden as anything in <i>Annie Hall</i>, but like almost everything else in the movie, it's played dead straight. This, of course, makes it extremely funny, up to a point, though in the end the real killer is the movie's abject sincerity. Pity, really, since there's certainly room for at least one decent movie about the actual appeal and experience of discos. The only true drug culture of the '70s, they deserve better than to be represented as watering-holes for arrested adolescents.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
Of all Hitchcock's films, this is the one which most reveals the man. As usual it evolves from one brilliantly plain idea: Stewart, immobilised in his apartment by a broken leg and aided by his girlfriend (Grace Kelly at her most Vogue-coverish), takes to watching the inhabitants across the courtyard, first with binoculars, later with his camera. He thinks he witnesses a murder... There is suspense enough, of course, but the important thing is the way that it is filmed: the camera never strays from inside Stewart's apartment, and every shot is closely aligned with his point of view. And what this relentless monomaniac witnesses is everyone's dirty linen: suicide, broken dreams, and cheap death. Quite aside from the violation of intimacy, which is shocking enough, Hitchcock has nowhere else come so close to pure misanthropy, nor given us so disturbing a definition of what it is to watch the 'silent film' of other people's lives, whether across a courtyard or up on a screen. No wonder the sensual puritan in him punishes Stewart by breaking his other leg. CPea.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Spy thriller in which Newman's defecting scientist is followed to East Berlin by his troubled fiance/assistant (Andrews), unaware that he is playing a double agent game. Hitchcock, seemingly too dour or too uninterested to turn in the title's promise of a Cold War ripping yarn, settles instead for a dissection of the limits of domestic trust, as Andrews' doubts about Newman's fidelity (to her, to the American Way) hinder his undercover mission in pursuit of an Eastern bloc MacGuffin. An above-average quota of glaringly shaky process work; but at least one classic sequence of protracted violence in a farmhouse kitchen.]]></review>

Everything, from our fuzzy friends short life spans devoted to hard labor to making natures couture of yellow and black stripes look chic, becomes fodder for funny. Wink-nudge pop-cultural references swarm the proceedings; if you imagine that Sting wont show up to be gamely mocked, think again. And all similarities between these born-work-die hive denizens and their clock-punching counterparts in the human world are underlined in bold. Wow, beestheyre so like us, right?</p><p></p><p>Corny puns and beating anthropomorphism to death are standard operating procedures for most animated features, of course, and even the dubious procapitalism climax is forgivable. But whos kidding whom? <i>Bee Movie</i> doesnt really care about anythingnarrative cohesion, character arcs, emotional resonanceassociated with savvy modern family entertainment. Its just a $150 million setup for Jerry Seinfeld to do a weak version of his didja-ever-notice? stand-up act. The suspension of disbelief is stretched to the breaking point, starting with Seinfelds Barry B. Benson chatting up a human female (Zellweger) for a potential interspecies romance (seriously: ick!) and ending with barely connected vignettes involving courtroom showdowns, floral apocalypses and landing an out-of-control 747. You might have been able to get away with stuff like this in the pre-Pixar age. Not anymore.</p>]]></review>

Instead of being frightened by humans, hes all up in their business. A sucker for a princess (Watson) in distress, Despereaux sets out to rescue her when the king lets their sovereignty fall into gloomy disrepair.</p><p>The miniature realm of <i>The Tale of Despereaux</i> is crammed full of detail. Villainous rats inhabit a sleazy city port thats ripe for animated trips down pits and up never-ending staircases; the action takes place on the vertical as much as it does the horizontal. The characters are imaginatively rendered, too: The mice are reassuringly cute, and in a CGI homage to a ye olde Englishe mythological figure, the Green Man makes an appearance in the royal household as a magically summoned harvest of cherry eyes, apple cheeks and pea pod mouth. The humans, though, are a case study in stereotyping; its hard to care what happens to Princess Pea when shes just a whiny British toff, waiting for a prince with a phallic-looking noggin to save her.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Fifty years on, you could say that Hitchcocks sleek, wry, paranoid thriller caught the zeitgeist perfectly: Cold War shadiness, secret agents of power, urbane modernism, the ant-like bustle of city life, and a hint of dread behind the sharp suits of affluence. Cary Grants Roger Thornhill, the films sharply dressed ad exec who is sucked into a vortex of mistaken identity, certainly wouldnt be out of place in Mad Men. But theres nothing dated about this perfect storm of talent, from Hitchcock and Grant to writer Ernest Lehman (Sweet Smell of Success), co-stars James Mason and Eva Marie Saint, composer Bernard Herrmann and even designer Saul Bass, whose opening-credits sequence still manages to send a shiver down the spine.<br />Hitchcock breezes through a tongue-in-cheek, nightmarish plot with a lightness of touch thats equalled by a charming performance from Grant (below), who copes effortlessly with the scripts dash between claustrophobia and intrigue on one hand and romance and comedy on the other. The story is a pass-the-parcel of escalating threats, all of them interior fears turned inside-out: doubting mothers, untrustworthy lovers, vague government handlers, corrupt cops. Within minutes of the films opening, shady strangers in a hotel lobby mistake Thornhill for a George Caplin and from there we sprint from country house to the United Nations, from the ticket hall of Grand Central Station to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. Thornhills ignorance of his fate and complete lack of control offer Hitchcock a brilliant blank canvas on which to experiment with a story that would sound ludicrous on paper, yet it feels like anythings possible in Lehmans playful script. Im an advertising man, not a red herring, says Thornhill. He couldnt be more mistaken.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Funded by grasping capitalist Cornelius Vanderbilt (Boyle), 19th century American adventurer Walker (Harris) and his band of mercenaries invade Nicaragua and join forces with the liberals against the country's corrupt ruler. Despite his disastrous military campaigns and political navet Walker eventually falls into the president's chair (a historical figure, he was self-proclaimed president of Nicaragua from 1855-57). He even makes the cover of <i>Newsweek</i>, because to drive home the obvious contemporary parallels, Cox litters the screen with historical anomalies: Zippo lighters, a Mercedes limo, journos with tape recorders. He presents this fascinating episode, which would have had far more potential as a straight political allegory, as a shambolic, Pythonesque satire. Only Ed Harris seems to have grasped this point: his controlled and credible performance is curiously at odds with a chaotic plot that shoots off in all directions without once finding its target.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Snow is the uncontested master of the structural movement. <i>Wavelength</i>, his first major work, is a relentless 45-minute voyage across a loft that perpetually transforms, questions and illuminates everything in its path. Proposing and requiring a radically different form of perception of what a film experience entails, it repels passive attention as much as it rewards participation. As Snow describes it: 'The space starts at the camera's (spectator's) eye, is in the air, then is on the screen, then is within the screen (the mind)'.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Jarman's biopic brings to life the <i>seriously</i> eccentric philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein: Viennese millionaire's son, schoolteacher, WWI infantry officer, hospital porter, gardener, naturalised Briton and homosexual. Initiated as a small-budget educational TV programme, then produced for the BFI by one-time Trot Tariq Ali from a script by Marxist professor Terry Eagleton, it hardly sounds enticing. But thanks to genuinely engaging performances by Johnson and Chassay (as Ludwig, man and boy), as well as a witty script and economical direction, this turns treatise into treat. It's shot on the simplest of sets against black backgrounds, with all the money spent on costumes, actors and lights, and framed like dark Enlightenment paintings. If it ranges wide rather than deep - the philosophy is either dropped into conversation or presented like a blackboard primer - Jarman still manages to capture the spirit and complexity of his fascinating subject. Of the entertaining cameos, Quentin's epicene John Maynard Keynes (in a delightful series of pastel shirts) and Gough's miffed Bertrand Russell are the most telling.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A no-frills propaganda piece put together by professionals. Captain Grant takes his submarine to the coast of Japan, where they slip through security nets to land a key information gathering team for US bombing raids. Along with the same year's British equivalent <i>We Dive at Dawn</i>, the blueprint for the sub-genre's laid out here, with depth-charge anxieties, underwater model work, rousing torpedo highlights and much banter among the mix 'n' match crew the order of the day. It's decently done, if perhaps at undue length, but Grant is obviously ill at ease with the straightforward macho heroics - he's far too urbane for crass dialogue of the 'Now they'll feel the sting from our tail!' variety.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The year is 1938, the setting a beleaguered Europe in which Cary Grant plays roving radio reporter to Ginger Rogers' Bronx-born gold-digger (with Viennese baron Slezak for a husband). A nonsense plot and bizarre soundtrack (continuous waltzes) can't disguise the fact that this is really three movies in one (love story, spy drama, anti-Nazi polemic), but the whole thing is saved by its irreverence, mixing the romance (and newsreel footage) with moments of outrageously tasteless kitsch: Rogers' Nazi husband cutting up a cake-map of Czechoslovakia, clocks with swastika hands. Splendid, eccentric tragi-comedy. And the erotic undertow of the Grant-Rogers partnership is just incredible.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Though lacking the mythic clarity of <i>El Cid </i>- Mann's other epic for Samuel Bronston - this is a superior example of the genre. Deserting the usual conflict of Christians and Romans, the story moves to a later era and charts the intrigues surrounding the Imperial throne, held by Marcus Aurelius and coveted by the corrupt Commodus, that led to the Romans' downfall at the hands of the Barbarians. Largely accurate in historical terms, thanks to a wordy but intelligent script by Philip Yordan (a master of the epic style), it is surprisingly restrained, both in terms of action and acting. But the atmosphere is consistently convincing: darkness holds sway on the fringes of the Empire, where the armies are struggling to repel the invading hordes, while Rome is presented as a magnificent but decadent monument to the unimaginative pragmatism of the Roman mind. Terrific sets, a stirring score by Dimitri Tiomkin and the overall quality of the production values manage to counteract the film's excessive length.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ex-Vietnam flier with poor nerves (and bad case of flashbacks) is ordered to steal deadly Russian jet from behind 'enemy' lines. The simple storyline is quickly grounded by flying chunks of exposition that director/actor Eastwood tries to ignore. Eastwood the director disregards many Cold War possibilities, preferring to dawdle over a first hour that mooches along while Eastwood the actor enjoyably dons various disguises, playing a man who can't act (or so everyone tells him) and is happiest left alone with his gippy nerves. Only in the airborne climax - a prolonged chase of modest ability - does he achieve solitary ecstasy, while, with a touch so perverse as to be admirable, the wordy finale is left to a foreign actor whose English is actually incomprehensible.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of the legendary <i>maudit</i> films, Smith's extravaganza of underground pleasure(ing)s doesn't quite stand up to its chequered fame. Shot in murky black-and-white, it visibly belongs to the early '60s, but nevertheless appears to originate from some arcane time pocket of the '20s, populated by vampy drag queens and draggy vampires, guests at a boisterous but strangely innocent orgy orchestrated with pulpy pop ditties and flapper anthems. Admittedly, it now comes across as an archive piece, and proves that boredom has always been a factor in the avant-garde's articulation of perverse desire. But as a missing link between prehistoric cine-camp and the dazed excesses of Warhol and the infinitely more trenchant George Kuchar, it is of academic interest at the very least.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Eastwood's Bird is bravely the Bird of the jazz faithful, with few concessions. Most of the exaggerations and telescopings of place and time will offend only the discographical mentality. The treatment of narcotics, race, and racism is matter-of-fact, nor is the sense of period insisted upon as it was in The Cotton Club; above all, brave beyond the call of duty, the director trusts the music, tricky old bebop. Music properly dominates the biopic, explaining Chan's long-suffering love for Bird and Bird's whole outlook on the world. The way the narrative leaps back and forth in time parallels the neurotic speed of uptake in bebop itself. Whitaker looks as if he's really playing, indicates the protean nature of the genius, and grabs the part of a lifetime with both hands. Venora's Chan is a miracle. The progression from the Chan of the courtship days,, with her hip, sassy dancer's walk, to the set face and shoulders of the common-law wife, tells a touching story of betrayed dreams. At last American cinema has done black music proud. Unforgettable.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A thrilling, intense chronicle analysing the thought and development of 'a very boring man who never made love in his life' (Rossellini). The 17th century scientist and philosopher struggles with a society which believes in witchcraft and ridicules his discovery of the vacuum. Notions of both are made concrete as the film illustrates Pascal painfully pushing Europe towards Enlightenment. Discoursing with Descartes, he explains the necessity of limits to reason for the existence of God. And the 20th century audience <i>understands, </i>recognising a world explored with extraordinary lucidity and simplicity. Faith grapples with empiricism, reason routs superstition, and with every frame, Rossellini reinvents the historical biography.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When the daughter and son of the late Francesca Johnson (Streep) return home to Madison County, Iowa, to oversee the funeral arrangements, they're shocked to learn that their mother wished to have her ashes scattered from the Roseman Bridge, not buried beside their father. Worse, they find Francesca's diary, relating how, in '65 while they were off with dad on a visit to Illinois, she met and fell for <i>National Geographic</i> photographer Robert Kincaid (Eastwood): an affair which was to affect her entire life. Immaculately performed, and assembled with wit and sensitivity, this is one of the most satisfying weepies in years. Indeed, it's hard to imagine anyone but Eastwood doing such a fine job of adapting Robert James Waller's best-seller for the screen. Typically, his clean, pared direction, coupled with Richard LaGravenese's mostly no-frills script, ensures that the film avoids sentimentality even as the two lovers rush to embrace it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A disarming movie, standing somewhere between a comic, contemporary version of <i>The Outlaw Josey Wales</i> (bunch of no-hopers finding fulfilment together) and Frank Capra (good 'little people', runaway heiress, scheming Eastern bureaucrats). Basically, it's the charming tale of a New Jersey shoe-salesman who fantasises about being a cowboy, and takes a group of assorted weirdos on the road with a travelling show. Not a lot to it in terms of plot, but Eastwood manages to both undermine and celebrate his character's fantasy life, while offering a few gentle swipes at contemporary America (the Stars and Stripes tent sewn together by mental hospital inmates). Fragile, fresh, and miles away from his hard-nosed cop thrillers, it's the sort of film only he would, and could, make.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A drama doc on the run-up and final for the 1983 Caesar's Cup in Las Vegas which proves even more engaging than <i>Pumping Iron</i>. The line-up of well-oiled beauties includes one controversial Australian, Bev Francis, who powerlifts 500 pounds for breakfast, and whose musculature defies rational analysis. The crux of the tournament then comes down to whether the judges, blind fools to a man, will accept something so obviously superior or opt for the safety of a body more 'traditionally feminine' such as gorgeous pouting Rachel McLish, who is discovered to have illegal padding in her unmuscled bits, oh the shame of it all. Ironically, the winner turns out to be the one with the firmest grasp of the political undercurrents. Huge fun. CPea.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[After three tours in Vietnam, gunnery sergeant Tom Highway (Eastwood) approaches retirement, and is assigned to the Reconnaissance Platoon where he started. Alas, the US Marines are now run by penpushers, theorists and time-servers; so when Grenada looms, there is only Highway between his rookies and a row of body-bags. In format, this is no more than the classic mission movie: first they train, then they do it for real. But the film belongs to Eastwood. Now looking increasingly like an Easter Island statue, he has a voice pickled in bourbon, a tongue like razor wire, and a body so full of shrapnel that he can't walk through airport metal detectors. When he isn't putting his men through hell, he is sobering up in the brig or reading women's magazines to get a clue on how to speak to his ex-wife. CPea.]]></review>

Beautifully staged by Mann with his usual eye to landscape, and an intriguing sub-theme querying the nature of military authority as Ryan's lieutenant, wearily devoting himself to shepherding his men through alive, comes into conflict with - while forced to rely on the battle skills of - Aldo Ray's sergeant, whose sole interest, pursued with dog-like devotion, lies in trying to save a shellshocked colonel (mad but still a symbol of authority).]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When New York journalist John Kelso (Cusack) arrives in Savannah, Georgia, to cover one of the lavish Christmas parties held by wealthy antique dealer Jim Williams (Spacey), he doesn't expect to get caught up in a murder trial. But after his host shoots volatile young employee Billy Hanson (Law), Kelso finds himself following the case with a view to writing a book, and making enquiries that might help substantiate Williams' self-defence plea - an investigation which, in introducing him to such locals as the transvestite nightclub artiste Lady Chablis and voodoo queen Minerva, uncovers a whole new world beneath the colourful but in many ways conservative veneer of Savannah society. Elegantly directed and beautifully performed, Eastwood's film of John Berendt's non-fiction best-seller is a warm, witty, consistently intriguing character study. Particularly successful are the funny, touching scenes shared by Cusack and the flirtatious Chablis, typical of the movie's fascination with questions of pretence, trust and tolerance. Also engaging, however, is the quirky wit and Eastwood's readiness, whenever the occasion arises, to deflect focus away from the crime on to other details in the social tapestry, subtly nudging at divisions involving race, class, gender and sexuality.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
Another post-modern mix of myth, musical, comedy, romance and unfettered pastiche from the impressively inventive Luhrmann, here ransacking pop culture's iconographic archives - rather than the real Paris of 1900 - to mount a hyperkinetic update of the Orpheus myth. Naive, lovelorn writer/composer Christian (McGregor) is taken up by bohemians like Toulouse-Lautrec to put on a show at the scandalous showplace of the title, where courtesan/torch singer Satine (Kidman) will do anything - even sleep with a dodgy Duke - to further her acting career, especially if pressed by the club proprietor (Broadbent) - until, that is, she meets Christian, and her heart melts. A <i>Red Shoes</i>-style fable of love and art in conflict with commerce and power, it's luridly stunning to look at even if it's cut a little too quickly and insistently for its own good. It's also jam-packed with allusions and gags, and performed with enormous gusto. If it lacks the emotional punch of Luhrmann's earlier films, and drags towards the end, it is still great fun.]]></review>

Adapted from her stage success <i>Diamond Lil</i>, it features her as Diamond Lou (a change occasioned by the original's notoriety), mistress of a Naughty Nineties saloon, setting her sights on the righteous young man (Grant) investigating the place for signs of corruption. West, making her way through ditties like 'I Like a Man What Takes His Time' and 'Frankie and Johnny', keeps most of her double-meanings single. Marvellous stuff.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It's the man again; back with a flatulent dog and his brand new .44 Magnum Automatic, investigating the trail of a corpse with 'a .38 calibre vasectomy' and a woman on a rape revenge crusade. This, the fourth of the<i> Dirty Harry</i> cycle, finds Clint as the usual pillar of troubled infuriation, his brows creased even more deeply by the usual dilemmas of inadmissible evidence and consequent vigilante justice; the villains are the standard Hollywood collection of unshaven lowlife, lesbians and giggling psychos bent upon the familiar course of distressing the more gentle citizenry ('One false move and the retard's brains get spread across the wall'). It seems rather pointless to cry Fascist once more in the looming face of Inspector Harry Callahan. The real problem here is technical; Eastwood the director is far less sure-footed than he was with the likes of <i>Play Misty for Me</i> or <i>The Outlaw Josey Wales</i>. Eastwood the star needed a hit to bolster his flagging ratings; now that he's got it, maybe Harry will be put out to stud, with his Magnum. CPea.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When ultra-secretive master burglar Luther Whitney (Eastwood) breaks into the mansion of a politically influential millionaire (Marshall), he's surprised by the arrival of the owner's wife and the discovery (he's hiding in a closet behind a two-way mirror) that she's carrying on with the US President (Hackman). Worse, after their drunken shenanigans turn nasty, Whitney witnesses both a murder and a cover-up. He's soon being chased by the cops (Harris) and the president's aides. Surely the best defence is attack. This light, part-comic Hitchcockian thriller, scripted by William Goldman from a novel by Daniel Baldacci, doesn't rank with Eastwood's best work as actor/director, but it's nevertheless solidly enjoyable. The script may lack even a shading of political analysis or comment, but it's hard to take against a contemporary Hollywood movie which forefronts a cowardly, cynical, philandering president.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When a colleague dies in a car crash, Steve Everett (Eastwood) of the <i>Oakland Tribune</i> inherits a human interest story on the upcoming final few hours of Frank Beechum (Washington), a convicted killer on Death Row. Trouble is, Steve's an investigative reporter by trade, tradition and temperament and, when he begins researching the case, starts to suspect the remorseless Beechum may be innocent. Moreover, his life is such a mess that he hardly has time to meet Beechum for a last exclusive interview, let alone to search for clues and win a stay of execution. Though the closing quarter of an hour is inevitably flawed by the kind of contrivance parodied in <i>The Player</i> and repeated in numerous race-against-time stories, for the most part this is another typically intelligent Eastwood film, a thriller that's unusually and movingly perceptive about human emotions. Though a couple of plot developments are clumsily scripted, as a character study it's performed, written and directed with wit, sensitivity and insight, ranging from the engagingly non-PC comic exchanges between Everett and his boss (Woods) to the affecting scenes between Beechum and his family.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Jazz saxophonist Fred (Pullman) is haunted by anxiety about the fidelity of his wife Renee (Arquette) and the mysterious arrival of video recordings shot inside their house. Fred sees himself, on one tape, next to his wife's battered body, and is arrested for murder. Overnight, Fred vanishes, to be replaced by garage mechanic Pete (Getty), who hasn't a clue how he ended up in jail. To make matters more mystifying, Pete presently becomes involved with Alice (Arquette again), mistress of his gangster pal Mr Eddy (Loggia), leading him into a nightmarish intrigue which only gradually begins to connect, obscurely, with Fred. The plotting, with its inexplicably metamorphosed protagonist and its various doubles, makes one suspect Lynch may be having us on. It's ironic, then, that narrative is the most intriguing thing about the film, leading us either to dismiss it as pretentious rubbish or to try to make sense of it on a metaphorical level. Fortunately, Lynch's mastery of mood through sound, space, decor and lighting means that we're more or less engrossed throughout, even though some of the sillier moments - not to mention the uncharacteristically clumsy use of music - try one's patience.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A magnificent movie that transcends its familiar tale of a reformed gunman forced by circumstance to resume his violent ways. When a cowhand cuts up a prostitute and a bounty is placed on his head, killer-turned-farmer Will Munny (Eastwood) joins his old partner (Freeman) and a bluff youngster (Woolvett) in the hunt. But in Big Whiskey, they must face the rough justice of Sheriff Daggett (Hackman)... While Eastwood's muscular direction shows he's fully aware of genre traditions, he and writer David Webb Peoples have created something fresh, profound, complex. It's not only a question of the excellent characterisations, but of situations given a new spin: the prostitutes and the spirit of Munny's dead wife introduce a feminist angle; there are insights into the thin line dividing law from justice; and the accent on ageing, fear and death establishes a dark tone perfectly complemented by Jack Green's sombre images. All of which links with the way this very violent film shows the cost of violence, painting a persuasive portrait of people increasingly given to emotions they have no control over. Refuting conventional cowboy heroics, Eastwood presents an alternative myth whereby a man, goaded by Furies to yield to a past that still haunts him, despatches himself to a living Hell. In this dark, timeless terrain, the film achieves a magnificent intensity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The title invites all measure of half-baked jest, but after witnessing the horrifying case of Soraya Manutchehri (Marn), any guffaws are likely to stick in the throat. An Iranian housewife falsely accused of adultery, Manutchehri was stoned to death in her rural village in 1986. French-Iranian writer Freidoune Sahebjamplayed here, in an awkward framing device, by Christ on the cross James Caviezelgot ahold of the story and turned it into a best-selling expos. This film adaptation is a well-made bit of prestigery, one that benefits from the performances of Shohreh Aghdashloo as Sorayas aunt Zahra, who tells the tale in flashback, and Marn, who lends her character an intense, haunted dignity.</p><p>Yet <i>The Stoning of Soraya M.</i> goes off the rails long before the Karo syrup starts gushing Monty Pythonstyle. Its a big ol wallow in unpleasantness, a film that relies on simplistically patriarchal antagonists and vague, wet-willie cries for intervention. Similarly, Caviezels man of action! heroics make for an ill fit with Aghdashloos abrasively solemn remembrances. The latter unfortunately call to mind Roger Eberts complaint about <i>Jaws the Revenge,</i> namely that a films heroine could not possibly be haunted by flashbacks to events where she was not present. Guess the writers room had a bit too much Mary Jane on hand.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Washed-up news anchorman (Finch) flips on air, finds God, and is gleefully exploited by his TV company to boost the ratings with his epileptic evangelic revivalism. <i>Network</i> gives a rather old-fashioned plot the '70s treatment: the result is slick, 'adult', self-congratulatory, and almost entirely hollow. Paddy Chayefsky's entrenched but increasingly desperate script parades its middle-aged symptoms to little effect: it's ulcerous, bilious, paranoid about youth, and increasingly susceptible to fantasy. Above all, it's haunted by fear of failing powers; presumably people telling each other what lousy lays they were is to be taken as indication of the film's searing honesty. Lumet's direction does nothing to contain the sprawl, and most of the interest comes in watching such a lavishly mounted vehicle leaving the rails so spectacularly.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
This shows Meyer to be a fine action director as well as America's best-known tit man. Though decorated with the usual array of top-heavy starlets - a trio of homicidal disco dancers on rest-and-recreation in the Californian desert (which means fast cars and whatever kinky thrills come their way) - it was in fact made as an exploiter for the Southern states' undemanding drive-in market. A cheap and efficient comic horror movie, it's funniest when its dialogue and characters' behaviour are at their most non sequitur. The twaddlesome plot about the cover-up of a man's murder by the (lesbian) leader of this girlie gang is helped enormously by a brooding music score which sounds as if it had walked in from a paranoid Cold War sci-fi film; and the weirdo desert farmhouse family the trio happen upon pre-dates <i>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre </i>by almost a decade.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Although <i>Babylon </i>shows what it's like to be young, black and working class in Britain, the final product turns dramatised documentary into a breathless helter-skelter. Rather than force the social and political issues, Rosso lets them emerge and gather momentum through the everyday experience of his central character Blue (sensitively played by Forde). A series of increasingly provocative incidents finally polarise Blue and lead to uncompromising confrontation. Although the script runs out of steam by the end, the sharp use of location, the meticulous detailing of black culture, the uniformly excellent performances and stimulating soundtrack command attention.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA['The Birds Is Coming' the advance posters twittered ungrammatically but with justifiable excitement. With death dropping blandly out of a clear sky - its menace magnified into apocalypse from the crop-dusting scene in <i>North by Northwest</i> - this is Hitchcock at his best. Full of subterranean hints as to the ways in which people cage each other, it's fierce and Freudian as well as great cinematic fun, with ample fodder for the amateur psychologist following up on Hitch's tortuous involvement with his leading ladies.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Even Chaplin fans who harbor a strong, sentimental attachment to <i>City Lights</i> will usually (though begrudgingly) admit that there are sturdier entries in the legends filmography: <i>The Gold Rush</i> is better constructed, <i>The Great Dictator</i> is funnier, <i>The Kid</i> is more emotionally fulfilling, and <i>Modern Times </i>has stronger social commentary. But if martians were to land on Earth and demand to know what this Chaplin character was all about, you could do worse than show them this silent tears-of-a-clown comedy. The movie exemplifies everything that was great and grating about the filmmakers artistry: his impeccable physical slapstick (see the boxing match) and his overreliance on embarrassing sentimentality; his intuitive understanding of the medium and frequent displays of the mammoth martyr complex that informed the comedians every move.</p><p>More importantly, <i>City Lights</i> contains the one single sequence that renders all those Chaplin-versus-Keaton debates pointless. Stop reading now if youve never seen the films famous climax: Having paid for an operation for a blind flower girl (Cherrill), the destitute Tramp meets his true love years later. The perfectly timed cuts, the graceful looks of recognition on their faces and that last line (Yes, I can see now) all hit you like a wallop. Only someone with slow-drying cement in their veins wouldnt be moved.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Of course one winces a little at the smug colonialist attitudes, and at the patronising 'You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din' which commemorates the humble native water-bearer's sacrifice after he dies blowing a bugle to save the Raj from falling into an ambush. All the same this is a pretty spiffing adventure yarn, with some classically staged fights, terrific performances, and not too much stiff upper lip as Kipling's soldiers three go about their rowdy, non-commissioned, and sometimes disreputable capers. What, one wonders, did William Faulkner contribute, uncredited, to the bulldozing Hecht/MacArthur script?]]></review>

Tati's Hulot on the loose in a surreal, scarcely recognisable Paris, tangling intermittently with a troop of nice American matrons on a 24-hour trip. Not so much a saga of the individual against an increasingly dehumanised decor, it's more a semi-celebratory symphony to Tati's sensational city-set, all reflections and rectangles, steel, chrome, gleaming sheet metal and <i>trompe l'oeil</i> plate glass. Shot in colour that looks almost like monochrome, recorded in five-track stereo sound with scarcely a word of speech (the mysterious language of objects echoes louder than words), this jewel of Tati's career is a hallucinatory comic vision on the verge of abstraction.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The act of being Charlie Chaplin, closet Communist and scandal-prone millionaire, had become too hard by the end of World War II. His resources such as they were, Chaplin decided to press on with his first film in seven years, killing off the Little Tramp and taking on the role of a money-loving Bluebeard with a taste for pointing out social hypocrisy. The characters final words to a court thats found him guilty of multiple murder: I shall see you allvery soon.</p><p>There are few comedies as resoundingly defiant as <i>Monsieur Verdoux</i>. Harshly received at the time, it is now impossible not to see it as anything other than career commentary, revealing a verbally excoriating (though no less dandified) Chaplin implicitly connecting the dots between entertaining the masses and making a killing. You probably wont like this onscreen Charlie; thats largely the point. He is the monster grown out of capitalist urgesand if you think that sounds didactic, know that the idea reportedly came from Orson Welles not long after he did <i>Citizen Kane.<br /></i></p><p>As with many lost films that are rediscovered, the circumstances around that rebirth are just as fascinating: <i>Monsieur Verdoux</i> became a massive New York City sensation in the summer of 1964 during its extended revival. One wonders what was in the air that July that finally allowed Chaplins sociopolitical satire in the door: <i>A Shot in the Dark,</i> free-floating nuclear anxiety, the Civil Rights Act. <i>Monsieur Verdoux</i> is the spirit of modernity taken to its darkest extreme. It may be immortal. <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Six years on from <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>, Travolta's Tony Manero is very much the same: one dimensional, bovine, manipulating, self-obsessed, as he fights his way from dancing obscurity to a starring role in some God-awful Broadway parody of a multi-million-pound Zanussi ad. On the way, he falls in and out with the ice-cool English star (Hughes), before opting for faithful old stablemate Jackie (Rhodes). The dance sequences seem poor beer when set against the vibrant amateurism of <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>, mostly rudimentary Martha Graham, with lots of close-ups to hide Travolta's obvious failings in that department. All could be forgiven if it weren't for the soulless overall slickness.]]></review>

Hollywood's chutzpah whizzkids Spielberg and Lucas team up to bring the audiences who flocked to <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Close Encounters</i> a replay of the innocent pleasures of Saturday serials, but done at two hours length with a much larger budget than the old cliffhangers could command. Spielberg's evasion of present day realities in an effort to recapture the sheer childlike fun of moviegoing is as perverse as was his previous film, <i>1941</i>. What he offers is one long, breathtaking chase of a plot as his pre-World War II superhero, outsize and Bogartian, races to prevent the omnipotent Ark of the Covenant from falling into the hands of Hitler's Nazis. Whether you swallow it or not, see it for a handful of totally unexpected visual jokes, worth the price of admission alone.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Aside from a handful of low-key Japanese animations, when was the last time you saw a traditional cel-animated movie? No, I cant remember either. So unstoppable is the onward march of digital that it has even enticed that most traditional of animators, Aardman, the Bristol-based studio renowned for its instantly recognisable stop-motion animations (Wallace &amp; Gromit, Creature Comforts, etc). Its a painstaking, time-intensive technique, but the final product has an appealingly organic, homely quality to it. The studios latest film, though, eschews soft Plasticine models in favour of recreating its distinctive animation style with computers. Maybe its just as well that they (and mother studio DreamWorks) chose the easier CGI option, because the resulting film is disappointingly below par.<br />Suave pet rodent Roddy St James (voiced by Hugh Jackman) lives a luxurious lifestyle in his Kensington home. But when an obnoxious sewer rat emerges out of a water pipe, Roddy  in Prince and the Pauper fashion  is maliciously dispensed to the sewers below. There he meets feisty punk-rat Rita (Kate Winslet), and together they unravel a dastardly plot by Ian McKellens nefarious Toad.<br />Its a kids rat movie, so youd expect some artistic licence to have been taken with the characters. However, in the same way Aardman quirkified its Chicken Run cast by giving them teeth, here its protagonists get human torsos and moppish hairstyles. Cute characters they aint. No question, the animation is crisp, rounded and model-like, but the pacings lethargic, the jokes  many of them movie-orientated and, for a world market, perhaps too British  are variable, the action sequences mostly uninspired and the characterisations and voice-overs underwhelming.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Desperation seeps out of every nook and cranny of Evan Almighty,
a monolithically dumb Hollywood vehicle that, like the capacious ark of
its neoNoah story, seems better suited to the tramplings of hundreds
of digital animals than the small-scale charms of actual human beings.
Can Steve Carell have jumped the shark so soon? No, but rarely has a
movie seemed so illustrative of the principle of miscasting: Carrels
squirmy nervousnessperfect for a junior congressman whos picked by
God for some unwilling environmental campaigningis here amplified to a
panicky shriek. It echoes in canyons designed for broader comedians of
yore. <br />
Speaking of Jim Carrey, hes nowhere to be found in his own sequel. (Morgan Freeman continues with his hepcat deity shtick from Bruce Almighty.)
While some might point to this absence as a changing of the guard, the
observation is clearly premature; as long as summer tent poles are
hoisted for high-concept bigness, theyll require stars who can fill
those projects with outsize egos. Carell isnt the only one straining
against the nature of his appeal: Wanda Sykes, as an aide, suddenly
seems just a tiresome sass source, while John Goodman, paradoxically,
is not called on for the bluster hes capable of. The biblical
messaging, benign and nonapocalyptic, will no doubt appeal to many
viewers too young or too selectively aware of Old Testament wrath. But
you dont have to be a believer to draw the line at multiple dung jokes
and a postclimax dance routine set to C+C Music Factory.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Some films subject child characters to various iniquities as a rather obvious way of pushing the audiences buttons, others put their young performers in dramatic situations because theyve got something to say about childhood and a world with scant respect for it. With this wisp of a feature from Ireland, its a bit of both. Pre-teens Kylie and Dylan are neighbours in a run-down estate on the outskirts of Dublin, where he dodges an alcoholic father and shes hiding a dark secret involving sexual approaches by a family member. The images explode from black-and-white into colour when they leg it together into the city centre, stolen cash in their pockets and nursing a plan to stay with Dylans estranged brother. Behind the bright lights of the pre-Christmas rush, however, lurk many dangers these two barely comprehend.<br />While the films compassion is never in doubt, its sometimes a bit too cute for its own good, wedging in a resistible running gag (and mystery guest appearance) involving Dylans famous musical namesake, and a verging-on-crowd-pleasing knockabout schtick involving rollerskates. Elsewhere though, writer-director Lance Dalys keen eye for Irish streetlife and even keener ear for authentic dialogue (not that youll catch every word) prove telling indeed, and in Kelly ONeill and Shane Curry he has remarkably un-precocious leads who blur the line between being and acting. The story aims to highlight a turning point in these constricted lives when these two can still choose to rise above or be beaten down by their surroundings  the performances make you believe it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of Hitchcock's finest films of the '40s, with Cotten as the infamous 'Merry Widow' murderer, who takes refuge with the small-town family of his sister (Collinge). Focusing on adoring niece Wright's dawning realisation that her kind, generous and handsome uncle is in fact a cold and cynical killer, the film is not only psychologically intriguing (both niece and uncle are called Charlie, and he arrives in town as if in answer to her prayers for excitement), but a sharp dissection of middle American life, in its own quiet way an ancestor of <i>Blue Velvet.</i> Is Uncle Charlie all these gentle folk deserve, when adolescent girls dream of the romantic life, and middle-aged men (papa Travers and neighbour Cronyn) endlessly discuss gruesome murder? Funny, gripping, and expertly shot by Joe Valentine, it's a small but memorable gem.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This adaptation of Elizabeth Goudges much-loved 1946 novel The Little White Horse (JK Rowlings girlhood favourite, no less) has all the ingredients of a classic childrens story. Theres a lonely orphan dispatched to a big house in the country after her fathers demise. Theres Moonacre manor itself, with its secret passages, spooky woodlands and a mysterious spectral white horse galloping in the fields. And theres a mystery to be solved, as clues in an illustrated manuscript tell of an ancient curse on the land a curse only a Moon Princess can lift. <br />What with Ioan Gruffudd glowering as the surly uncle, a steady supply of new dresses and a touch of tween romance, its all expertly tailored for slightly bookish little girls, with Golden Compass star Dakota Blue Richards an agreeably unprissy lead. Unfortunately, the fate of Moonacre Valley is a slightly academic issue, so we never care as much as we should. Nicely put together, but just a little dull.]]></review>
