      <review><![CDATA[<p>This month's Anything Goes, Anything Shows! screening at Palate Palette is Favela Rising, by director Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary (2005).<br /><br />This award-winning documentary focuses on the good works of Anderson Sá - a social revolutionary in the slums of Rio. With the use of hip-hop music and Brazilian dance, he unites the community against violent oppression enforced by the drug armies and corrupt police. However, a tragic accident threatens to silence his ever-growing movement. Free admission. Also, free popcorn!<br /><i><br />
"Favela Rising celebrates the strength of the human spirit to assert itself in the face of human rights violations, social injustice, and unexpected adversity. Chronicling the rise to greatness of the AfroReggae movement, the film shows how the music and culture of Brazil's underclass transform into a catalyst for grassroots social-change. But most of all, Favela Rising is the story of a community that works. The success of the film should be judged on how well it serves to activate its viewers; how well it inspires action."</i><br /><i>- Jeff Zimbalist, Co-Director</i></p>
<p>Total running time: 80 min. (2005/ Brazil &amp; USA). Language: Portuguese (with English subtitles)</p>]]></review>
