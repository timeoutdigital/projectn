      <review><![CDATA[DreamWorks 3-D interpretation of Cressida Cowells tale is fast-flying fun. But admirers of the source material may be caught off guard, because the movie has little in common with the 2004 novel. Even the basic premise has been changed: In the book, Vikings domesticate dragons; in this version, they destroy them.  Teen outcast Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) is a disappointment to his father, Stoick (Gerard Butler), the leader of a Viking tribe plagued by murderous fire-breathers. Trying to make his papa proud, Hiccup attempts to slaughter a monster, but ends up befriending him instead. It turns out that the beasts are just misunderstood. Cue a romance between a fellow dragon-slayer trainee (America Ferrera) and Hiccup, plus a scaly showdown and reconciliations between father and son (and between dragon and man).  Despite its formulaic unfolding, the film transcends banality through heartfelt performances and awesome CGI effects. And just think: After the flicks done, you can buy the book and enjoy a new story. Thats one upside to such an unfaithful adaptation. Raven Snook]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Theres tons of brooding for your buck in the hilariously earnest Remember Me, which will hopefully be revived several years from now as a beloved midnight movie. Twilight inamorato Robert Pattinson (star and executive producer) confidently sulks his way through this jaw-dropping mix of come-hither stares, love me, Daddy! histrionics and historical tragedy. Hes Tyler Hawkins, a gloomily soulful NYU student at odds with his businessman father (Brosnan), and who cracks Boyz II Men jokes as if he were Allen Ginsberg reading Howl. After getting into a street fight, hes arrested by a policeman (Cooper) whoit just so happenshas a daughter (De Ravin) also enrolled at NYU. One alpha-male bet with his roommate later, Tylers on a retributive datebut then love begins to bloom.  Sex is had, past secrets are revealed, but all is not well in Camelot, as director Allen Coulter and writer Will Fetters shamelessly hint via snatches of summer 2001 news broadcasts (its a period piece, see) and a telegraphing glimpse at a certain pair of buildings. I cant say any more beyond telling you that I came out of the screening with an ear-to-ear grin I dont usually get from even great movies. Bless you, R.Patz &amp; Co., because this gloriously steaming pile is officially in the bad-movies-we-love pantheon. Keith Uhlich]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Russia, 1910. In his old age, Leo Tolstoy has become so famous worldwide that the merest hint hes about to pop his clogs sends newsreel cameras gathering in anticipation. The real story though, as this slightly fusty drama elaborates, is unfolding inside the Tolstoy household, where the octogenerian writer (Christopher Plummer, authentically beardy) finds himself in the centre of a dispute over the valuable publishing rights to War and Peace. The Tolstoyan political movement  an organisation espousing his ideas on communal property to combat social injustice  sense a major funding opportunity should Tolstoy sign his best-known book over to their leader Chertkov (Paul Giamatti), yet Tolstoys aristocratic wife Sofya (Helen Mirren), having delivered him 13 children, is determined to fight her corner to the bitter end. Idealism versus family ties makes for a potentially juicy set-to, yet its the historical detail which keeps this adaptation of Jay Parinis novel relatively intriguing, rather than merely stodgy. Writer-director Michael Hoffman is all reverence towards Tolstoy himself, but curiously supercilious towards the beliefs of the Tolstoyan movement, thus undermining the key subplot (eager young acolyte James McAvoy gets his dream job as the great mans secretary, but must also spy on him) and unfairly loading the central conflict in favour of ferocious spouse Mirren. Her impressively projected performance becomes the dominating factor, causing Plummer to overdo it, and sidelining both the earnestly wet McAvoy and moustache-twirling Giamatti. Engaging performers all, but the movies superficial flummery is slightly exasperating when the true-life events would have provided an even richer palette of ideas. Trevor Johnston]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[On a South Carolina beach, a reticent G.I. Joe (Tatum) on temporary leave meets a rich girl (Seyfried), and the duo instantly ignites sparksNicholas Sparks, that is. Another achingly earnest adaptation from one of the chick-lit superstars formulaic weepies (The Notebook, A Walk to Remember), Chocolat director Lasse Hallströms tastefully old-fashioned melodrama has exactly one objective: yanking gallons of cathartic tears out of your face by any means necessary. After several heart-swelling weeks togetherwith a turgidly shot make-out session in the rain forever binding our young lovebirdsthe two vow to reunite after the soldiers tour of duty ends, leaving the art of letter writing to stoke their flames of passion. As they barely know each other (meaning ditto for us), however, insincere proclamations about their skin-deep chemistry, as read in voiceover, probably arent enough to lube the eyes. Which doesnt mean Dear John is without a few wet-duct tricks up its sleeve: Theres more autism, cancer, 9/11 shocks and bittersweet heartbreak here than you can shake a hankie at. Sometimes the leads pull off genuine tenderness, and other times their gauzily written caricatures cant elevate such overwrought housewife bait, but chances are, given its literary pedigree, most viewers are preordained to love or loathe it.

      <review><![CDATA[Like any given episode of Family Guy, this adaptation of CD Paynes novel is such a relentlessly cruel piece of work that you cant help but laugh heartily at it. The insatiable libido of horndog high-schooler Nick Twisp (Cera) is the impetus for various scattershot misadventures that revolve around his desperate attempts to bed the Belmondo-loving Sheeni Saunders (Doubleday). Shes a sharp-tongued inspiration in Nicks otherwise soul-deadening existence, constantly prodding him to come out of his shell and let his freak flag fly. And so it does, when Nick creates François Dillinger (also Cera), a more suavely confident and seemingly corporeal alter ego who wreaks havoc wherever he goes.As this snake-tongued doppel-gänger, Cera sports a pencil-thin moustache, lasciviously brandishes a cigarette and embodies a perfect parody of adolescent wish-fulfilment. Hes also a profane little f**ker: In Youth in Revolts funniest scene  set in that comic goldmine, an all-girl boarding school  the two Ceras share screen space, as François coaches Nick on the proper, most vulgar ways to seduce Sheeni. Its a kick to see Cera cut loose from his patented befuddled-nerd routine, even if the films caricatured performances and fish-in-a-barrel scorn are sure to be monotonous for some.

      <review><![CDATA[A ray of sunshine onscreen, Drew Barrymore isnt going to suddenly make a grungy roller-derby movie. (Even the naughtier ex-Drew who once flashed David Letterman couldnt swing that.) So shes done something harder: made an intensely sweet roller-derby movie about letting your kids grow up happy. Whip It, Barrymores confident debut behind the camera, starts off in a desperate Texas nowheresville  an oven of blonde beauty pageants and crap jobs. Then, along with its teenage dreamer, the film sneaks off to an evocatively captured Austin and the world of cute but callous indie-rockers and snarly girls in kneepads. Finally, it ends with a kitchen reconciliation. (This is where Barrymore is most effective at conveying heartbreak.)Along that exuberant trajectory, Whip It rights a few wrongs. First, theres proof here that Junos Ellen Page is no mere flash in the pan. She uses her tiny frame to project vulnerability, coming alive as she flings herself into danger, shedding the starchy name Bliss Cavendar for the unlikely track moniker Babe Ruthless. In assembling her sassy sisterhood, Barrymore has also given the criminally underused Kristen Wiig her first proper role, as a maternal roller with no-bulls**t sympathies. (You wish the script hadnt fully sanded down the butch aspects of the derby scene, but apparently thats what subtext is for.)Most substantially, the film pits parental hopes against the private ambitions of youth, and somehow manages to take both sides. Marcia Gay Harden is the pictures treasure; watching her swell with concern at her daughters choices, you understand how hard it is to let go  even when kneepads are provided.

      <review><![CDATA[Up in the Air seeks comedy from two of Americas  indeed the Western worlds  most current fears: flying and redundancy. A tough ask, you might think, but director Jason Reitman offers an enjoyable balance of laughs and sorrows, pratfalls and body blows, even if this charming road movie (or should that be air movie?), adapted by Reitman and screenwriter Sheldon Turner from a 2001 novel by Walter Kirn, finally doesnt end up anywhere nearly as interesting or original as the enticing signposts suggest en route.  This is Reitmans third film after Thank You for Smoking and Juno, both of which were much less assured when it came to marrying social reality and laughs. George Clooney is Ryan Bingham, a bachelor and corporate lone gun who derives more pleasure from the 300-plus days a year he spends travelling around the country making people redundant than the 43 miserable ones he spends at home in a characterless apartment, out of step with the parochial glamour of his middle-rung executive lifestyle. Bingham, played winningly straight by Clooney, is a rare airborne species whose entire existence is threatened when his company hires tight-faced, thrusting young graduate Natalie Keener (a fun Anna Kendrick) to reassess the companys operations. This preppy pipsqueaks big  idea is to stop sending reps around the country and instead give clients employees their marching orders via a glorified version of Skype. Its an idea that falls sympathetically on credit-crunched managerial ears, although Binghams worried reaction reflects our conflicted response to the movie as a whole: half of him fears for those about to be sacked by satellite, while the other half fears losing a lifestyle that allows him to indulge in pleasures such as no-strings affairs with fellow travellers like Alex (Vera Farmiga), a good-time lady who implores him to think of me as yourself with a vagina. We might sympathise with those clearing their desks, but the threat of not being able to tag along with Clooney for the ride feels just as critical. Its an honest point: empathy only ever stretches so far.  For all its superficial topicality, Up in the Air mostly feels old-fashioned, nostalgic even, in its fond lament for a pre-9/11 world of travel. There are no security scares in this world. Its fetishisation of the rituals of flying is near-pornographic, with check-in girls substituting for bedfellows and frequent-flyer cards for sex toys. Binghams winning of millions of air miles come across as notches on his bed post. Hes the Warren Beatty of interstate business travel.  Its a pleasure to watch an adult American comedy that tries to deal with the real world, however much of a fantasy it carves from it. But the films later scenes as Bingham attends the wedding of a distant sister and has to face some ground-level realities about himself and his relationships are not as convincing or edifying as they should be and his sideline in motivational speaking never rings true as a symbol of his changing attitude to life. The films final announcement that even the most frequent flights of imagination have to touch down at some point is conventional and a little disappointing. But the journey is a riot while it lasts.

      <review><![CDATA[Kitsch is most enjoyable when it doesnt know its kitsch. Everyone  involved in Shutter Island  most obviously director Martin  Scorsese and star Leonardo DiCaprio  seem to be taking this berserk,  meandering story absolutely seriously, which only serves to make an  already fun psychological thriller all the more ludicrous and  entertaining.The film is set in 1954. DiCaprio plays Teddy  Daniels, a US marshal dispatched to the titular oceanbound asylum to  investigate the disappearance of a criminally insane inmate from her  locked cell. He soon begins to suspect that this remote facility isnt  all it appears  is Ben Kingsleys avuncular psychiatrist really as  kindly and welfare-conscious as he seems? Why are the guards so heavily  armed? And whats with the mysterious lighthouse that all the patients  seem so terrified of? To make matters worse theres a hurricane coming  in, the generators are on the blink and Teddys new partner Chuck  (Ruffalo) is starting to look decidedly shifty. Taxi Driver this  aint. In fact, the Scorsese movie it most resembles is his  previous exercise in Hitchcockian overkill, 1991s Cape Fear.  With DiCaprio rather limp and forgettable in the lead, Shutter Island  lacks the might of Robert De Niros powerhouse central performance  in the earlier film. But it compensates with pure visual, aural and  narrative excess: this is modern gothic taken to its (il)logical  extreme, a work of pure operatic delirium. The closest Shutter Island  gets to a commanding, De Niro-like presence might be its perverse,  overbearing soundtrack, a selection of heavily doom-laden pieces by  modern composers ranging from Kryzstof Penderecki to Max Richter. Every  twist in the tale is accompanied by a frenzied flurry of violins, every  moment of violence underscored by a pounding, atonal piano crescendo.While  the narrative, adapted from Dennis Lehanes 2003 novel, is hopelessly  convoluted, the film is held together by the sheer bludgeoning force of  Scorseses directorial vision. Never one to shy away from visual  overindulgence, Scorsese has used Shutter Island as an excuse to  really throw open his box of tricks, chucking in gaudy but strikingly  beautiful dream sequences, harrowing (if rather tasteless) concentration  camp flashbacks and the most thunderous, howling rainstorms this side  of Dario Argentos 1977 classic shocker Suspiria.In fact,  Argentos film, a similarly monumental and manic triumph of style over  substance, may be the most appropriate comparison here. And while  Scorsese may lack the giallo masters manic invention, the  tension between his natural tendency towards old-fashioned Hollywood  classicism and his evident desire to cut loose gives the film its  strange, irrestistible power. As senseless, perverse and unwieldy as it  undoubtedly is, Shutter Island might be Scorseses most enjoyable  film in a decade. Tom Huddleston]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Thirty-five years after Network and All the Presidents Men,  in which journalists told uncomfortable truths and defended democracy, Green  Zone makes military personnel do the noble work which craven  reporters shirk. The only consolation is that the movie is inspired by a  work of journalism, Rajiv Chandrasekarans Imperial Life in the  Emerald City: Inside Iraqs Green Zone.  Set in Iraq in the  months following the 2003 invasion, the film reunites the director and  star of The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum,  Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon; this time, however, we already know the  details of the underhanded government action our hero confronts. Damon  plays an army warrant officer whose WMD sorties keep coming up empty;  unwilling to roll over, hes soon embroiled in a turf war between the  CIA and the Pentagon (personified by conscientious Brendan Gleeson and  oleaginous Greg Kinnear) while attempting to wrangle a Baathist general  (Igal Naor), a useful veteran (Said Faraj) and a useless embedded  reporter (Amy Ryan) against a backdrop of more-or-less real events.  Greengrasss  approach to real-life disaster is far more simplified and pumped up  here than it was in United 93 or Bloody Sunday, but  theres much to be said for his Bourne in Baghdad approach. The  action is robust, the politics simplified but strident, insisting that a  wilfully under-prepped war worked against both US and Iraqi interests. By  shifting focus from the naively doctrinaire civilians of  Chandrasekarans book to street-level soldiers questioning authority,  Greengrass concocts a formula with a fighting chance of dispelling the  Curse of the Hollywood Iraq Movie. If a picture as conventionally  accessible as Green Zone tanks, that campaign is surely lost. Ben Walters]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Desperation oozes from every frame of Cop Out, which front-loads its best jokean aerial pan from Manhattan to Kings County scored with the Beastie Boys 'No Sleep Till Brooklyn'then spends the rest of its running time endlessly spinning its wheels. Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan are partners in law out to recover a stolen baseball card from some badass Hispanic gangsters. How we arrive at that golden nugget of a plot complication is something for the Robert McKees of the world to illuminate; for the rest of us, this is some soul-sapping dada with which director Kevin Smith is staining his already-dubious résumé. The actors constantly indulge in unfocused improv: Morgan is given what feels like a full reel to unleash an unfunny succession of re-created film scenes, each followed by a reaction shot of Willis telling us what said scene is supposed to be (Heat!; The Color Purple!). The camera later fleetingly catches game supporting actor Kevin Pollak doing a spot-on De Niro impersonation, and its like seeing the difference between mastery and cacophony. Nearly all the jokes are spewed as if they were a barrage of bullets. Thats fitting, since this purported comedy is also senselessly violent: Guns are fired with reckless abandon. Blood is carelessly spilled. And amid all the carnage, were supposed to give a damn about whether Morgans wife is cheating on him and if Willis can give his daughter a dream wedding on a cops salary. Then theres the Seann William Scott stoner scenes, but, really, why prolong the torment? Keith Uhlich]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For the past year, 3D has been a guarantee of box-office gold, as proven by the runaway success of Avatar. But now, for the first time, a film arrives for which the 3D element may prove to be a commercial hindrance. Its not only that Clash of the Titans will compete with Alice in Wonderland, How to Train Your Dragon and Avatar for the nations 3D screens. More critically than that, the film's conversion to 3D (a decision taken late in the filmmaking process) has rendered this campy, unashamedly old-school but still highly enjoyable blockbuster rather painful to watch.  In story terms, Clash of the Titans doesn't stray too far from the beloved 1981 Ray Harryhausen classic which spawned it. The setting is mythical Ancient Greece  an age of Gods, monsters and muscular men in little chainmail skirts. Sam Worthington is Perseus, an orphaned demi-God drawn into the battle between man and the immortals when Hades (Ralph Fiennes), lord of the underworld, threatens to unleash his great sea-beast, the Kraken, on the city of Argos. Accompanied by a ragtag band of warriors, Perseus sets off to learn the secrets of the Kraken and end the reign of the Gods once and for all.  Theres no ignoring the fact that Clash of the Titans is a mess: the plot is episodic and rushed, the dialogue blunt and occasionally laughable, and there are far too many characters, few of whom leave much of an impression. Both Worthington and love interest Gemma Arterton look like theyre on a strenuous Aegean package holiday, but luckily theyre surrounded by the likes of Fiennes, Pete Postlethwaite and Liam Neeson as Zeus, whose commanding, armour-clad presence seems, at times, to be the only thing holding this crumbling edifice together.  Other notable names dont fare so well: Danny Huston gets a mighty fake beard but just one line as sea-God Poseidon, Mads Mikkelsen does little more than bare his teeth as burly swordsman Draco and, most egregiously, Jason Flemyng gets a terrific backstory and some superb melting-face makeup as ruined ruler Calibos  and that's it. It's is a recurring problem throughout the film: with dialogue and character motivation cut back to the bare minimum, theres no way for anyone to express themselves except through action.  But, luckily, this is where Clash of the Titans succeeds. Whatever the flaws in the script, theres no faulting director Louis Leterriers visual ambition: this is a film of mighty vistas, beautifully designed beasts and intense, well-structured combat sequences, all rendered in eye-popping, though still rather fake-looking, CGI. Taking the lessons of The Lord of the Rings to heart, Leterrier goes all-out for excess: his computer-generated camera soars above sprawling cities, endless deserts and blasted underworld hellscapes, lending the film a dizzying, epic scale.  A shame, then, that the addition of 3D has rendered much of this grandeur all but unwatchable, blurring the image to a headache-inducing degree and adding absolutely nothing to a film which was obviously shot in two dimensions and should have stayed that way. As an experiment in high-Hollywood style over substance, Clash of the Titans is a very entertaining ride. But take our advice: sidestep the 3D and see it the old fashioned way.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The stylish opening  a camera track through an ashen forest  attests to the talents of ace cinematographer Don Burgess. His moody and immersive visuals (most memorably a shoot-out filmed, Children of Men-style, in an illusory single take) lend weight to this otherwise routine post-apocalyptic tale set in a future America of 2043.  A mean motherfuckin servant of God (Denzel Washington) shepherds a mysterious book to some locale way out west. After a stopover in a decrepit outpost, the holy warrior attracts the attention of a snake-tongued saloon owner (Gary Oldman) who wants to use the book for his own purposes. Cue guns n ammo showdowns, not to mention much product placement the J Crew and Motorola folk bedevil us even in the end-times.  Thank the pallid green heavens for Jennifer Beals (long ago in Flashdance) who is ravishing as a sightless kept woman acting as the storys oracle. She wanders the halls of her makeshift prison like a goddess deprived of power. For a few brief moments, the film becomes something close to Greek mythology, as opposed to weak graphic-novel imitation. Keith UhlichSee latest film reviews.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Apologies to all of you whove been looking forward to Lewis Carroll getting the Tim Burton treatment. For this loose amalga-daptation of both Alices Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, Burton is in dispassionate, for-hire mode, which means hes more concerned with computer-generated eyesores than with the character, Alice Kingsley (Wasikowska), whose subconscious theyre meant to represent. Alice is no longer a girl, but a woman in her late teens facing an arranged marriage to a snooty stick-in-the-mud. While mulling her situation, our heroine is drawn back to Wonderland by the White Rabbit. Its there that a prophecy is unveiled (damn prophecies!) saying Alice will slay the monstrous Jabberwock, whos been terrorizing the land at the behest of the literally big-headed Red Queen (Carter). Save the terrific Sweeney Todd, Burton hasnt convincingly visualized a dreamworld since his mid-90s heyday. The grounding psychology of his fantastical characterslike his two Eds, Wood and Scissorhandshas eluded him since hes gone green screen. Its especially damaging in this case, since the Alice novels are all about a girls inner life made animate. Wasikowska certainly looks the part, but we never get the sense that this placeor playth, as Johnny Depps lisping, unmemorable Mad Hatter might sayand its populace spring from her psyche. Shes basically lost on a Burtons Greatest Hits ride at Disney World, where even an ostensibly inventive character like the films toothy, dematerializing Cheshire Cat feels like a weightless derivative of the directors more tangible past creations. And unlike Carrolls perversely idealized protagonist, Burtons Alice is just another anachronistic feminist tearing down Victorian patriarchal norms. Even her[shudder]Avril Lavigneblared theme song is a skin-deep grrrl-power accessory. Keith Uhlich See latest film reviews.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Towards the end of the Coen brothers The Big Lebowski, a black-clad German complains that a situation isnt fair. Fair? splutters Walter Sobchak (John Goodman). Whos the f**king nihilist around here?! Life isnt fair for the lead of the Coens latest, A Serious Man, either. Larry Gopnik (Stuhlbarg), a mild-mannered mathematics professor in 1967 suburban Jewish Minnesota, is struggling with a crumbling marriage, alienated kids, a burdensome brother, malicious professional rumours, a siren neighbour and incessant calls from a mail-order record company. Unlike the nihilists, however, Larry has faith: he is a conscientious Jew and tries to be a serious man. So, to quote a Jefferson Airplane song from the films soundtrack, when the truth is found to be lies and all the hope within you dies Then what?Glanced at in many of the Coens earlier films, Jewishness is front and centre here, from the shtetl-set, Yiddish-speaking prologue to the hermetically Jewish community in which Larry lives. Drawing on the actual milieu of their own adolescence, the filmmakers  past masters of outré production design and sardonic genre subversion  play things relatively straight to tell a story that, for all its plentiful absurdities, is sincerely engaged with the challenge of unjust suffering. Bewildered, desperate, nose twitching in perplexity, Stuhlbargs Larry has been compared to Job; understandably, given his host of burdens and the settings Old Testament overtones. Yet Larry is perhaps closer to Kafkas Josef K, another put-upon character who suffers an unwarranted ordeal without quite being heroic.The Coens nod at familiar stylistic tropes  florid swearing, sexual euphemism, crusty, aged characters  but the films potency is rooted in quiet precision and detailed realisation. Roger Deakins typically polished photography gives an oppressively hard edge to Midwestern suburbia while the sound design is a wondrous mélange of soup-slurping, hacking coughs, gastric juices and ominous clanging. Stuhlbarg, a Tony-winning stage actor, leads a largely unknown but impeccable cast that also includes Sari Lennick as Larrys no-nonsense wife, Fred Melamed as her smug, unctuous lover and Richard Kind as Larrys sad-sack brother, forever draining a cyst on his neck.Established religion offers Larry little consolation, but the idea of faith  or at least good living  that emerges from his struggle matches the sensibility the Coens have unobtrusively espoused throughout their work: reject worldly status, bear trials with humility, find joy in fellow-feeling. Bad things happen to good people. To acknowledge  even, as storytellers, to embrace  this fact is not to indulge in nihilism, but to make more urgent the social task that might mitigate its effects. Youd better find somebody to love. Ben WaltersSee latest film reviews.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Following a disastrous incursion into bubblegum high-school romance territory (I Love You, Beth Cooper), Chris Columbus, director of the first two Harry Potters, returns to his comfort zone for this episodic and mirthless fantasy saga based on the first of a series of fantasy books by US writer Rick Riordan. Mulching together the angsty teen intrigue of Harry Potter and the frigid-and-proud flagwaving of Twilight, the film sees Zac Efron lookalike Logan Lerman (Gamer) playing an underachiever who turns out to be a sword-swinging demigod when he discovers his birth was the result of the god Poseidon (Kevin McKidd) having a quick fling with dowdy New York housewife Catherine Keener. When his mother is kidnapped by Hades (Steve Coogan in full Saxondale mode) as a bargaining chip for Zeuss lost lightning bolt, Percy is charged with finding a number of trinkets dotted across North America in order to avert a crisis on Mount Olympus (located just above the New York cloud cover, who knew?) and save mom from eternal damnation.  That Percy risks life and limb to preserve the family unit is typical Columbus, and the film works best when playing on the idea that no amount of bravado is enough to mask our desire for parental love. Yet its not enough to compensate for the computer-game-style plotting, which is largely based on us picking up narrative nuggets that mechanically slot into place later on. Problematic, too, is the product placement: witness the scene in which Percy battles Medusa (Uma Thurman) and avoids her deathly gaze by craftily using the shiny back of his iPod as a mirror.

      <review><![CDATA[Although far better than its troubled history lead one to fear, this gory, gothic take on the classic lycanthropic love story has had its romantic heart ripped out. Returning to his estranged fathers crumbling pile in 1891  to investigate his brothers disappearance  actor Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) falls for his dead siblings mourning fiancée, Gwen (Emily Blunt). But before this spark of love can ignite, Lawrence is bitten by the lunar-tic creature the locals fear, and must confront the beast buried within himself. With its mist-shrouded sets, gruesome slaughter and copious CGI, this is a surprisingly respectful updating of the 1941 Universal original. Thanks to Rick Bakers make-up effects, Del Toros transformations from handsome lover to hairy, howling beast are frighteningly convincing; Anthony Hopkins is restrained as his emotionally detached father; and a cruelly underused Blunt is all-a-quiver as the beautiful, bereaved Gwen. Ultimately, though, neither Joe Johnstons efficient direction nor Danny Elfmans hard-working score can lift the familiar storyline out of the ordinary. Nigel Floyd]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Anyone heading to the cinema this February 14 will find themselves conspicuously catered for by this romantic comedy from veteran Garry Marshall (Pretty Woman, Beaches). Throwing out a net to everyone from back-row teenage saliva-swappers to seasoned seniors, the film feels like it has been coldly calculated to hoover up demographics. How? Marshall gives his rom-com the Robert Altman Short Cuts treatment: an enormous megawatt ensemble cast appear in a dozen or so interlocking lurve stories that play out on Valentines Day in Los Angeles. Its supremely efficient and utterly ruthless.There are 19 all-star names above the title (in alphabetical order, naturally) but the lead belongs to Ashton Kutcher. A nice-guy florist, he proposes to his work-addict girlfriend (Jessica Alba), but is obviously much better suited to his teacher best friend (Jennifer Garner). Jessica Biel (is it me, or are the Jessicas interchangeable?) plays a neurotically single sports publicist. Anne Hathaway, an office temp who moonlights as a phone sex operator (little nod to Short Cuts there), hasnt told her new boyfriend about the sideline. Shirley MacLaine, happily married for 50 years, is keeping an old secret from her husband. In what reeks of final-draft add-on, country star Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner from The Twilight Saga pair up as school sweethearts: no actual storyline here, but they tick the pre-teen box big time.  These are sassily-scripted but glossy, vacuous fantasies  with the exception of Julia Robertss army captain, whos on short leave from Iraq and meets a guy (Bradley Cooper) on a plane: after some sparky but non-committal flight banter they go their separate ways and both their tales resolve with unexpectedly lovely flourishes. Their stories make the rest of the film look like its got a cold, shiny cash register right where its heart should be. Cath Clarke]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Jeff Bridges, for all his glorious achievements, still hasnt been celebrated enough. A technical actor (remember Starman?) who manages to make every gesture a perfect one, hes been paired with difficult material over a meandering career and always succeeded. So if this better-than-average country-singer tale does the trick come Oscar time, heres someone who wont complain. Bad Blake, much like Bridgess immortal Dude, is belly-acting: gutsy and, well, big-gutted. The number of times Blake is seen emerging from a pickup truck with his belt unfastened is almost a running joke. Rambling through a series of Texas bars and vomiting behind them, Blake is haunted by a musical protégé whos become a huge star (Farrell). His own glory days are long behind him.  Crazy Heart pairs this fascinating private strummer with a curious journalist (Gyllenhaal), who soon shares with him a bed and the affections of her daddyless young son. For the movies first hour, you perk up at the vibrations of sympathetic emotions, pitched at a quiet frequency not heard since Tender Mercies. (The appearance of Robert Duvall is a bonus.) Upsettingly, though, someones decided that such intimate moments are not enough for a night of entertainment, so a manufactured kid-in-jeopardy climax and Blakes rehab stint blow the mood. Until then, this is great American acting. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Not a great deal happens in Bright Star, Jane Campions breezy and beautiful film about the nineteenth-century British poet John Keats (played by Ben Whishaw). The New Zealand directors film is light in the most attractive and dreamy of ways: it floats on its own, intimately explored love story and refuses to be weighed down by either period fixtures and fittings or the later reputation of Keats, whose final years and stalling romance with his neighbour Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish) Campion handles with a smartness and sensitivity that feel teasingly throwaway.Thats not to say theres anything slapdash about Campions story of how Keats moved in next door to the fatherless Brawne family and fell in love with slightly younger Fanny, tentatively courting her and writing her wonderfully honest letters but fatally kept at a distance by poverty and illness. In fact, for this critic, its the exquisite detail of the whole affair, coupled with the aerating winds of modernity that blow gently through the film, rather than the emotional pull of the doomed love affair at its heart, that are the films real success. (Others, I must say, differ on this point, judging by the sobs and sniffles to my left and right at the London Film Festival screening of the film.) A combination of unstuffy dialogue, wise casting, unselfconscious performances and sensuous but never pretty photography makes Campions version of the nineteenth century feel current but not anachronistic.Campion came to Keatss story, which she shot in Britain last year, after a four-year sabbatical from filmmaking  and it shows, especially following the dark, oppressive atmosphere of In the Cut, one of her least successful films. Her telling of this biographical tale, inspired by Andrew Motions biography, feels as if its told by someone with much knowledge but little weight on their shoulders. Its a feeling one gets from the performances too, especially from Cornish and Whishaw, who both, at times, threaten to float off on a cloud of their characters distraction. Its down to the side players, especially an earthy Kerry Fox as Fannys mother and a boisterous Paul Schneider as Keatss friend and protector Charles Brown, to give the film some vim away from the fog of love. Whishaw, with his troubled air and vulnerable features, is perhaps better as a Romantic lead than a romantic one, and if the film has one crucial failing, its that theres a crucial spark missing between Whishaw and Cornish. Campion treats Keatss talent as a given and not a cue for creaky explorations of inspiration and artistic otherness. She weaves his poetry into the drama, calling for it to be spoken naturally and not at all awkwardly by her characters. Its not easy to follow verse this way, but it certainly inspires the viewer to head straight from the cinema to the bookshop. Dave CalhounSee latest film reviews.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Best wipe 8 1/2 from your mind, or at least delay seeing Fellinis loopy masterpiece, if youre going to enjoy this angsty romp through the directors 1963 film about a fictional Italian filmmaker, Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis), who loses his mojo and might be about to lose his marbles and his marriage.Surprisingly, though, theres lots in this musical version, itself an adaptation of a 1980s Broadway show, that relates to the sombre heart of Fellinis original. We still get Guidos formative childhood memory of watching a prostitute perform on the beach (although this time it is Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas brilliantly belting out the films foot-tapping anthem Be Italian). We also get the lingering ghost of his mother (Sophia Loren!), the pain of his adultery and the madness of his creative impasse. Also, Fellinis meshing of dream and reality is oddly suited to the unreal tendencies of a musical, although its anybodys guess what the director would have made of Penélope Cruz throwing herself around in stockings and suspenders and upping the sex factor beyond anything Claudia Cardinale offered in the original.The biggest difference, though, is that almost 50 years later, director Rob Marshall (Chicago) is able to play the story of 8 1/2 as a nostalgia piece. He fetishises the look and feel of 1960s Italy and especially Rome so that the films mood of artistic melancholia is expressed on a canvas that comes dangerously close to looking like an ad for Italian coffee. Marshall and his writers, including the late Anthony Minghella, also stress the humour of Guidos philandering, often preferring that his inner turmoil goes no further than chain-smoking. To give Day-Lewis his due, the actor grounds the films sillier tendencies in a charming performance of mercurial despair. Hes well supported by Marion Cotillard, who conveys the sadness of being  Guidos wife, although both Nicole Kidman as his leading lady and Kate Hudson as an admiring journalist are little more than window-dressing.

      <review><![CDATA[What am I now? asks the extraordinary Saoirse Ronan, her eyes welling. The dead girl? The lost girl? The missing girl? Im nothing. Whatever the flaws of this less-than-wondrous version of The Lovely Bones (and there are several), theyre not of this poised actor, as intuitive a teen talent as Haley Joel Osment. The sky around her just swirls a little too vigorously; the story, brought to screen in a showy CGI manner, takes place in a strange first-person purgatory out of which teenage Suzie Salmon, murdered by a serial killer, narrates her story. Alice Sebolds 2002 novel was heartrendinga potent mixture of grief, resignation and the resiliency of memory. Such spells can sometimes make it to the screen intact. (Think of Sofia Coppolas The Virgin Suicides.)  The filmmaker we get, though, is Peter Jackson, and while hobbits and giant apes are temporarily exorcised from his system, he hasnt quite recaptured the psychological intimacy of 1994s Heavenly Creatures. This new movies 70s-era clothes and cars are detractingly vivid; scenes often feel like the hyperreal dream sequences of Brian De Palmas Carrie. The Lovely Bones is a supernatural tale too, and Jackson, scripting with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, has amped up the suspense elements at the expense of delicate mood: An unrecognizable Stanley Tucci pursues Suzies younger sister in a Hitchcockian housebound chase that thrills to no purpose. There wont be any justice here, and you cant help but think a heroically committed Mark Wahlberg (less ruined than the books dad) or a sassy Susan Sarandon (as the boozy grandma) are somehow beside the point. Its a movie that tips toward overkilleven Ronans voice is amplified into a weird whisper. More quiet would have helped. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A companion piece to Fernando Meirelles souped-up (and lapped-up) 2002 urban crime drama, City of God, Paulo Morellis City of Men replaces that films hypnotic sadokineticism with something equally, if more quietly, audacious. By accentuating the humour and humanity of people stuck in desperate circumstances instead of fetishising the violence that surrounds them, City of Men serves as a belated corrective to its predecessor.The follow-up concerns two young Rio favela dwellers, best friends Ace and Wallace (Silva and Cunha, both non-professional actors who also appeared in Meirelles film), coping with a drug-gang turf war that forces them to reconcile with the past and accept incipient adulthood. A rift develops between them when Wallace finds his long-absent father and Ace begins taking more comfort in the thug life than with his wife (Monteiro) and son. Meanwhile, the gang leaders (Haagensen and Eduardo BR Piranha) pursue what amounts to a deadly, futile game of king of the hill that produces no real victor. This wry reductionism gives City of Men a moral edge over the gunplay-besotted posturing of the previous film, despite the fact that Morelli occasionally succumbs to earnestness and sentimentality, and loses narrative focus in the final act.

      <review><![CDATA[Its quite likely that Staff Sergeant William James (Renner)the bomb-defusing expert at the center of the terrific Iraq War action film The Hurt Lockerwas named by screenwriter Mark Boal after a certain pragmatic 19th-century philosopher. On the cleverness-to-profundity scale, that falls somewhere between calling a desert-island survivalist Locke and christening a living stuffed tiger Hobbes. But James is more than his moniker, not so much larger-than-life as eternally engaged, gruntlike, with the one thing he does better than anyone else.  Renner, whose half-muscled pudginess calls to mind Fassbinder circa Fox and His Friends, gets inside Jamess skin in ways that a more seasoned celebrity could not. Its a role that might have easily devolved into one-note paeans to badassery, especially in concert with an episodic story structure that constantly toggles between machismo-laden home-base drama and perilously prolonged fieldwork. Yet in this actors hands, the character comes off with a credible working-class clarityhes less concerned with performing kiss-off heroics than with doing a good job and pissing the night away.  The James-free prologue, which features the first of two kill-em-off star cameos, seemingly sets the stakes high. But director Kathryn Bigelow, doing her run-n-gun best, doesnt mine traditional suspense so much as impart a queasy feeling of monotony. The Hurt Locker is all about existing in an often repetitious moment. Superimposed titles count down the days left in James and his squads rotation, though theres little sense of movement toward an ultimate endpoint. As the opening Chris Hedges quote (War is a drug) suggests, there are no accomplishments in this line of work, only an unending round of highs, lows and in-betweens. Keith Uhlich]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[During the Bush era, it was pretty hard to make a military comedy. The armed forces tended to be presented as either noble or amoral but seldom as clowns. The Men Who Stare at Goats is refreshing, then, for its knockabout approach to martial matters; its problems lie with its lackadaisical approach to narrative and structure.  The film is a dramatised version of Jon Ronsons non-fiction book about a small pocket of the US Army given licence to experiment with non-violent and paranormal approaches to conflict resolution. American journalist Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) arrives in Kuwait in 2003 with a broken heart and something to prove. Stumbling upon Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), whom he recognises as having been involved in the so-called First Earth Battalion, he finds himself on what could well be a wild goose- (or goat-) chase inside post-Saddam Iraq. Meanwhile, he fills us in on the battalions history, from its instigation by Nam vet-turned-hippy visionary Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) to its undoing by bitter psy-op Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey).  Theres plenty to enjoy in the films outré set-pieces, insouciant tone and playful performances: Clooney keeps us guessing about Cassadys abilities (and sanity) and Bridges gets to deliver lines like: Im your commanding officer and Im ordering you to let out the dance! Theres also a running joke about Jedi warriors that bounces nicely off McGregors Star Wars pedigree. But the film hedges its claims to veracity (more of this is true than you would believe, indeed) and fails to make its characters or narrative dramatically compelling. The result feels less like a transcendental breakthrough than a bit of conjuring misdirection. Fun trick, though. Ben Walters]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The X-Men, Spider-Man and Batman movies have proven that the second instalment is where a comic-book blockbuster series finds its feet: with all those pesky origin details out of the way, the filmmakers can focus on raising the stakes, deepening the characters and ramping up the action.   And for the first 45 minutes or so, this is where Iron Man 2 looks to be heading. Director Jon Favreau sets the stage for a titanic three-way conflagration as Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is under investigation by the US government following the public revelation of his superhero persona, while his arch rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) is scrambling after his technology and mysterious, musclebound Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) is up to unspecified no-good. The dialogue crackles, the special effects pop and the onscreen action never flags, climaxing with an astonishing multi-car pileup at the Monaco Grand Prix, where Iron Man meets his nemesis Vanko, aka Whiplash, for the first time. So far, so excellent: Favreau builds on the solid foundations of the first movie, and success looks guaranteed. But slowly, imperceptibly, it all starts to fall apart during the remaining hour or so.  A major problem is the number of characters: Downey, Rockwell and Rourke are obviously all enjoying themselves enormously, but the same cant be said for Don Cheadle as Starks redundant buddy-cum-sidekick Rhodes. Nor do the others seem to be having much fun: Gwyneth Paltrow is underused as Stark's assistant-cum-love interest Pepper Potts, while Scarlett Johanssens Natalie is slinky but pointless. The less said about a perfunctory appearance from Samuel L Jackson as some sort of shady inter-agency bigwig the better.  As the film plays out, it starts to look likely that all the rumours of reshoots and recuts werent just online rabble-rousing. Characters appear and vanish. Seemingly important plot details surface and are swept away. And this feels increasingly like a film which got lost in the edit. Whereas in the first act we jetted from Siberia to Washington to Monaco, the second half is mostly confined to a series of boardrooms, army bases and laboratories. A flat, studio-bound final showdown takes an age to arrive and is over in minutes.  Iron Man 2 is a lot of fun: its shiny, likeable and never boring. But its also wildly uneven and unnecessarily convoluted, leaving the viewer unsatisfied and hungry for something more substantial. Lets hope a promised third instalment can fulfil the series undeniable potential. Tom Huddleston]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Once upon a time, a nebbishy New Yorker could fall for a willowy shiksa goddess and you could call it Annie Hall. No longer. Now, the whole movies got to be set in Los Angeles (not just one Christmas sequence), our love object barely gets a single la-di-da, and forget about naming the film after her. Weve got inner male pain to address. That shift, though, is precisely what makes Greenberg, Noah Baumbachs latest comedy-drama, so car-crash-arresting and emblematic of Gen X self-absorption. Baumbach, an expert at skewering urbane pretensions ('The Squid and the Whale'), has conceived a remarkably sour character in Ben Stillers furious letter writer and fortyish layabout, Roger Greenberg. Once a college-rock musician, he scotched his bands momentum in a fit of principle and now suffers the consequences: occasional work at carpentry and pride-swallowing in the home of his much wealthier brother. A ratty Steve Winwood T-shirt speaks volumes, as does a shelf of meds and a constant stream of bile directed at partygoing kids who scare him with their potential. Rogers just not fun to be around. Baumbachs idea here is to find an expiration date on boyishnessits tempting to compare Greenberg to the more-trenchant 'The Anniversary Party' (2001), also a shrewd examination of the limits of youthful decadence (and partly created by the filmmakers wife, Jennifer Jason Leigh, as is this). This movie corrects its wobbly, negative spiral with the romantic development of Florence (Gerwig, spacey as ever), a personal assistant to Rogers sib and perhaps a salvation. Scratch that perhaps: Greenberg only slightly misses the top flight by settling for too weak a foil. (The better option, Rhys Ifanss bruised bandmate, is right there.) But when Stiller indulges in moments of unfulfilled rage, this has real desperation. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Photo: Twentieth Century Fox There are those of us who can watch brainy Tina Fey bobble around 30 Rock for hours, and drink up her every self-deprecating zinger like freshly brewed espresso. (As for the others who dont get herwe understand Sarah Palin has a new show.) Still, theres no reason why Fey, so dynamic on the small screen, has to get Anistoned out of a proper Hollywood crossover. Baby Mama (2008) was cringingly mediocre; indeed, one has to cast back to 2004s tangy, Fey-scripted Mean Girls to get a reasonable glimmer of her talent. Even then, we were still watching Lindsay Lohan.  Date Night isnt going to alter this conundrumit makes you laugh in fits and starts, but more often it feels toothless and exhausted, the kind of project that exists to give Ray Liotta work. (The generic script is by Shrek-sequel scribe Josh Klausner.)  Fey is almost perfectly paired with Steve Carell as bored, married New Jerseyites Claire and Phil: The way they trade quips and cast snide aspersions at strangers, the actors seem totally believable as intellectual mates and, more crucially, deeply in danger of losing intimacy. After stealing a reservation at a clichéd-snobby NYC eatery, the couple is mistaken for blackmailers and pursued by goons, North by Northweststyle, throughout the city.  You know where this is going; shouty misadventures in a slow-moving motorboat, a clamorous car chase and an exclusive sex club will surely move them out of the most excellent roommates category. When Mark Wahlberg shows up as a shirtless tech-heavy spyone who can also flirt in Hebrewhe almost constitutes a joke in himself. But cant there at least be faster fish for Fey and Carell to shoot in the barrel? Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Christopher Isherwoods seminal queer novel deserves a film adaptation that captures both its sense of place and its activist spirit. Cowriter-director Tom Ford settles for the glossy ephemera of a Vanity Fair cover spread. Both Isherwood and Ford follow Brit-expat college professor George (Firth, dully competent despite the film festival plaudits and Oscar buzz) through a single, sun-baked California day at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis. But only in the film is there a hoary motivating factora suicidal death wish stemming from Georges mournful pining for his dead lover Jim (Goode)meant to round off edges that should remain jagged. (The most frayed thing onscreen is, tellingly, an angora sweater.) Fords biggest mistake is making George a martyrdom-ready symbol; too many movies subscribe to the regressive notion that queers are unassailable victims of fate and circumstance. One of the most revealing amendments here involves a flashback in which George is informed of Jims death and is refused an invite to the funeral. Theres no such melodramatic manipulation in Isherwoods tome, where George is invited to the funeral and refuses out of a fascinatingly contradictory mix of pride, prejudice and anguish. It deepens his humanity rather than making him allegorically alien. Isherwood set out to normalize his gay protagonists experience, showing the many different poses he assumed within a seemingly routine day (in that context, masturbation was as mundane yet significant an occurrence as driving on the freeway). Ford privileges sexual preference over all else. Its the defining trait of his Georgea Camille-esque affliction signaled by a portentous cough and overcome in a sacrificial ending that turns Isherwoods beautifully enigmatic final passages into a poisonous, irony-laced tear-jerk.

      <review><![CDATA[Photo: Cathay-Keris Films and InnoForm MediaIts surely no coincidence that when Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), the comic-book-reading New York teenager who decides to buy a coloured wetsuit and become the superhero of the title, winds up in hospital after his first outing as a vigilante, he reads Watchmen. Like that story, the series by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr, on which Kick-Ass is based is a comic about comics, presuming a substantial knowledge of the icons and conventions of the superhero genre. Its an index of how successfully that genre has established itself in the Hollywood mainstream over the past decade that such postmodern, self-referential fare is now deemed apt fodder for major studio releases.  Puzzled that no one has ever tried to put comic-book theory into practice, Dave hits the streets in the name of righteousness, overcoming early setbacks to achieve hero status with a little help from MySpace and YouTube. He also attracts the attention of father-and-daughter vigilante team Big Daddy and Hit Girl (Nicolas Cage and Chloë Moretz) and arouses the enmity of crime lord Frank DAmico (Mark Strong), whose son (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) sees a chance to dabble in the hero game himself.  Director Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Stardust) directs with efficiency and a good sense of action while Johnson puts in an engaging turn that maintains sympathy and helps paper over some of the plots more jerky, episodic aspects. Wearing its sources on its Spandex sleeve, Kick-Ass fairly bulges with references to other comic-book movies, especially the Spider-Man and Batman franchises; Cages stilted delivery as the Dark Knightish Daddy is a nice touch. Theres some intriguing play around ideas of closetedness  a perennial concern of the genre  with Daves secret life leading classmates to presume hes gay. Other conventions are touched upon but left unexplored: while it is constructed around three father-child pairings, for instance, the film leaves Daves single dad a cipher.  The bond between pre-teen Hit Girl and her Big Daddy, meanwhile, is as intense as it is outrageously violent, rooted in such affectionate larks as his shooting her at close range to familiarise her with the use of bullet-proof vests. The duo are responsible for many of the pictures numerous fatalities, shown in more detail and with more gusto than in most superhero films (or most 15-rated films, for that matter). The sight of Hit Girl slicing and dicing half a dozen thugs to the accompaniment of the Banana Splits theme tune locates Kick-Ass in the post-Tarantino landscape of hyperfictional ultraviolence. Any gestures at a version of realism or the pathos that might result from someone actually trying to be a superhero are lost in the wash. Ben Walters]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Isnt Greek cheese at least supposed to arrive at the table aflame? My Life in Ruins takes the tepid framework of the aimless travelogue  ooh, statues  and weds it to the mysteriously durable appeal of Nia Vardalos, whose blandly likeable turn in My Big Fat Greek Wedding seriously tested the limits of stardom. Here she plays Georgia, an American expat bounced into an accidental life as a mediocre Grecian tour guide who needs to find her inner spirit and, inevitably, do that robust Anthony Quinn dance. Assisting her on her journey is a thinly conceived busload of tourists (American boors, Spanish hotcha mamas, English snobs, etc), all of whom learn lessons in shucking clichés as they steer Georgia toward Poupi (Georgoulis), their broodalicious bus driver. Settling for My Life in Ruins requires a serious lowering of the bar: like digging a groove for it. Amazingly, were supposed to learn lessons in adventurousness from a movie that plays like a 1980s TV special episode, but if theres one thing the pinched-faced Vardalos seems incapable of, its veering from the comfort zone.Act! youll scream at her. Shell shrug. When ham bone Richard Dreyfuss, smirking his way through the role of a pontificating widow, is your chief source of pleasure, its time to push this Trojan horse outside.

      <review><![CDATA[Hollywoods campaign to convince audiences that beefy Scots bulldog Gerard Butler can play the romantic lead gathers pace with this misjudged marital crime caper. Butler plays Milo Boyd, an ex-cop turned bail bondsman assigned to haul in his ex-wife Nicole (Jennifer Aniston), a hotshot reporter in deep with the law. The pursuit takes this pair of bickering exes from New York to Atlantic City and back, via a series of perfunctory car chases, poorly choreographed punch-ups and excruciating romantic entanglements.  The trouble is not so much that Butler isnt funny  he isnt, even slightly  but that he sucks the merest hint of humour from the entire enterprise. Even proven performers like Aniston and Christine Baranski as a sexually voracious mother-in-law are reduced to desperate mugging and hysterical arm-waving in an attempt to fill the comic vacuum which their muscular co-star leaves in his wake. To be fair, the script gives them little to work with: there are maybe three decent laughs, interspersed with long stretches of  interminable, would-be witty banter and one near-unwatchable comedy torture scene.   The score, too, is atrocious: infuriatingly cheeky in the comedy scenes, switching to screeching Bon Jovi-esque AOR whenever things kick off. The Bounty Hunter isnt bad enough to be offensive: its simply lazy, trite, smug, irritating and a colossal waste of time, talent and money. Therell be worse films released in 2010  but not many.

      <review><![CDATA[In this stunningly charmless romcom, pet-store owner Zoe (Lopez) has a crippled Boston terrier called Nuts who gets around with the aid of a little cart. The poor little fellow, as you might imagine, is often deployed for aw reaction shots. He also begs for food, with a look that mixes hope and despair in equal measure. Youll recognize that look, since you can also see it on the faces of Lopez and her supposed romantic interest OLoughlin. Bad actors! No biscuit! Its not entirely their fault. The only novel twist in the script is that Zoe, tired of waiting to meet the right man, has decided to have a baby on her own. This leads to such distinctive delights as watching Lopez sit on the toilet with a home pregnancy kit, trying to relax and pee while little Nuts looks on quizzically (Aw). Otherwise, the whole thing is like a Franken-romcom, made from parts dug up at midnight. On the very day she is artificially inseminated, Zoe meets Stan, a hunky, good-natured cheese maker who inexplicably keeps an apartment in the city though he has a sprawling farm upstate. He also has a distressingly well-developed torso, and OLoughlins often pained facial expression may be because hes in a constant state of flex. The possibility that he might rupture something from all the flexing provides the only real tension in the movie, since hes so perfectly nice and caring that theres never any question about whether they should be together. Weirdly, a movie about a single woman who decides to have a baby makes other single mothers the butts of endless jokes about their neediness, their hippie-dippy water-birthing, their inappropriate breast-feeding of a three-year-old, etc. The elderly get equal mockery, so theres thatHank Sartin]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Like Nureyev and Baryshnikov, Li Cunxin was a ballet dancer too talented to be hidden from the eyes of the West, and too canny not to defect at the earliest opportunity. He made his grand jeté to freedom in 1981 while a guest artist at the Houston Ballet and danced with the company for 16 years. Later, he moved to Australia with his wife, Mary McKendry, and joined the Australian Ballet. His memoirs, a straightforward, inspirational story published in 2003, were a surprise international bestseller for Penguin Books Australia. Now comes the film, which has been put into the capable hands of screenwriter Jan Sardi (Shine) and national treasure Bruce Beresford - neither of them slouches at straightforward, inspirational stories.  In 1972, 11-year-old Li (Huang Wen Bin) is plucked from a dirt-poor village in Shandong province and sent to Madame Mao's Beijing Dance Academy. Here, he is subjected to years of gruelling training and Maoist claptrap. Spotted by Houston Ballet director Ben Stevenson (Bruce Greenwood), the adult Li (played by Birmingham Royal Ballet principal Chi Chao) is seconded to America, where he quickly realises that the West is not the den of poverty and decadence the party's propagandists would make out. After falling for an American dancer called Liz (Amanda Shull), Li starts hatching plans to stay with the help of immigration lawyer Charles Foster (Kyle MacLachlan), but faces the agonising possibility of never seeing his family back in China again.    The production enjoyed a surprising amount of access to Chinese locations and these scenes - photographed by Peter James in a grainy, nostalgic style - are exquisite to look at. Sydney, meanwhile, stands in for Houston, with a rollcall of Aussie actors playing the Americans (local viewers will have fun name-checking them). Chi Cao is a likeable leading man whose dancing is spectacular, and Joan Chen is moving in brief scenes as Li's mother. The film's galvanising performance, however, comes from Canadian actor Bruce Greenwood (Star Trek) as Li's mentor Ben Stevenson. A scene in which Stevenson, a driven but gentle and nurturing man, has to explain to Li the meaning of a racist term, is quite affecting.  Aussie moviemakers have shown themselves adept at a range of genres this year and we should not be surprised to see a great coming-to-America' film among them. Mao's Last Dancer's two hours go by in a flash, and the ballet sequences choreographed by Graeme Murphy are an added visual treat in a film with an embarrassment of riches. Late in his career, Bruce Beresford has delivered one of his best movies. Nick Dent]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The sensitive touch of Rodrigo García  a talented HBO house director (In Treatment, Carnivàle) with an extremely spotty feature career (Nine Lives, Passengers)  keeps this gimmicky ensemble melodrama out of the bullshit-detector red zone. As in most of his films, women take centre stage: middle-aged health-care worker Karen (Bening) is the biological mother of icy power attorney Elizabeth (Watts), whom she gave up for adoption immediately after birth. In a seemingly unrelated thread, the slightly manic baker Lucy (Washington) prepares to adopt a child of her own, since shes been unable to conceive. All three live in Los Angeles, but none of them have ever met. Uh-oh.  Much as Nine Lives hinged on an aesthetic stunt (each sequence was filmed in a single shot), Mother and Child borrows the 'were-all-connected' converging narrative patented by executive producer Alejandro González Iñárritu (Babel). It remains an annoying, faux-profound structural tic  at this point, there are no more returns to diminish  though this doesnt negate the stellar performances García induces from his central female trio.  Watts is the most immediately attention-grabbing, with the story dictating that Elizabeth move from legal-eagle whore of Babylon (a terrific Samuel L Jackson plays her willing prey) to martyred, maternal saint. A believably unbalanced Bening scores the movies true coup: Karens revitalising relationship with a sweetly persistent co-worker (Jimmy Smits) is a rare example of Hollywood doing right by midlife romance. And Washington, because shes the least caught up in the twisted-pretzel plotting, gives Lucys every gesture the hallmark of truth. Everything else, sad to say, is just Hallmark.

      <review><![CDATA[Movies as sexy and colourful as Broken Embraces really shouldnt feel this boring. But thats the troubling thing thats happened with the work of Pedro Almodóvar, whose catty, chatty melodramas now play like dutiful festival mainstays rather than truly vibrant alternatives. The Spanish director is too assured not to serve up a spicy meal  and his longtime leading lady, Penélope Cruz, is riding a fascinating crest of post-Vicky Cristina Barcelona complexity. But watching the new film is like getting upsettingly full on insubstantial tapas: you would never say no to just one more, but theres better.After a standout opening seduction in which a blind man manages to charm an assistant half his age out of her jeans, the movie settles into a strangely stilted four-way. Theres the aforementioned lothario with the pen name Harry Caine (Homar), once a popular film director but now a screenwriter in the dark; his former producer, a shady businessman whom we see only in flashback; the young secretary they both shared as a lover (Cruz); and a mysterious, intense videographer (Ochandiano) out for unspecified vengeance.Shifts in tone between comic frustrations and romantic jealousy are elegant enough, but too polite given theyre from the maker of the sparky Talk to Her (Habla con Ella). Were supposed to care about the fate of a botched farce, stolen from the directors hands and disastrously recut, but such editing-table discussions are stalled in an echo chamber of Hitchcock allusions (mainly for snobs only). Eventually, the movie meanders to a lost-father story and one revelation too many. Almodóvar needs to push himself again. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Were so used to amped-up white-knucklers that the controlled approach of a filmmaker like Roman Polanski is immediately seductive. The director responsible for such mainstays as Chinatown and Rosemarys Baby turns Robert Harris political potboiler involving a ghostwriter (McGregor), a former British prime minister (Brosnan) and an isolated island home into a slow-burn near-masterpiece.Shot in claustrophobic widescreen, the film showcases Polanskis mastery of even expository scenes: a revealing conversation between McGregors so-called ghost and a shady figure played by Tom Wilkinson is so fraught with tension that you expect those malevolent Cocteau-esque hands from Repulsion to burst out of the wall and drag someone into oblivion.The film stays more grounded than that, though it certainly doesnt want for perverse Polanski flourishes. Theres a great bit of carnal business with the prime ministers wife (Williams) thats filmed in a deadpan long shot. Eli Wallach pops up  frail-looking though spirited  as an old-timer who stokes the writers paranoia about his employers plans for him. More than one character has a wry aside on the protagonists heritage (Oh, you Brits!), as if it were both a badge of honour and a reason for condescending suspicion.There are any number of similarly colourful touches (the sick-joke ending alone is worth the price of admission) that help to deepen what one colleague suggested is the greatest airport novel ever filmed. Its true that The Ghost Writer doesnt possess the lingering profundity of the directors best work  the War on Terror window dressing is just that. Yet Polanski has crafted this genre piece with a verve and vitality that is sadly in short supply these days. Keith Uhlich]]></review>

Children got ogre-fart jokes and Eddie Murphys manic jackassery; adults chuckled knowingly at pomo references and the subtleties of the Gingerbread Man screaming Eat me! Four chapters later, any attempts at satisfying both the prepubescent and the postcollegiate mind-sets have been shrugged aside, but whats truly head-scratching is which way the series ended up skewing.  'Shrek Forever After' (is that a threat?) kicks off with a montage of our hero (Myers) in a domesticated rut: feed and change the brood, go about the daily routine of middle-class indignities, have dinner with the same group of friends, rinse and repeatad infinitum. Finally, Shrek suffers a nervous breakdownwhat else would you call a rage spiral that ends with smashing your fist into a birthday cake?and is suckered into a Faustian bargain with Rumpelstiltskin (Dohrn). Its one thing to sell scatological gags to grown-ups, but pitching kids a toon version of 'Its a Wonderful Life'? Seriously?  Such a sideways move toward maturity might be applaudable if the rest of the film werent just desperately beating a dead cash cow. Third times are rarely charms in the movies, much less fourth go-rounds, and it takes more than ho-hum 3-D and video-game-ready action sequences to liven up diminishing returns. When a chubby tabby is given the best lines, alienating the 12-and-under set with midlife crises might be the least of your problems. David Fear]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her fashion-conscious gal pals are back, and theyre taking the girl-power hi-jinks to a whole new level. First things first, though: the gay, gay, gay wedding of bestest friends Anthony Marantino (Mario Cantone) and Stanford Blatch (Willie Garson), where chorus boys sing Sunrise, Sunset, swans frolic among the guests, and Liza Minnelli officiates. Watching that queerest of queer icons risk her umpteenth hip replacement by performing Beyoncés Single Ladies (dance moves and all!) is as suspenseful as a Hitchcock set-piece, and a difficult act to top.  So writer-director Michael Patrick King doesnt even try. Instead, after this camp overture, were plunged headfirst into Carrie and friends familiar mock-troubled paradise: Ms Bradshaws relationship with the debonair Mr Big (Chris Noth) is moving further toward stifling domesticity. Neurotic mother Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is worried her braless live-in nanny has the hots for her hubby. Lawyer Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) quits her job after too many put-downs from her chauvinist boss. And Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is, well, horny as fuck. What a great time to take an all-expenses-paid trip to Abu Dhabi!  Taken in hand by this formidable foursome, the big, bad Middle East becomes a menopausal Westerners delight. One wrongheaded jaw-dropper follows another, from Samanthas description of a gay manservant as Paula Abdul to a comic climax in which the ladies escape an angry male mob by wearing hijabs and abayas given to them by like-minded Muslim women.And the featherbrained feminism the franchise specialises in reaches its apex when Carrie files her latest book, I Do. Do I?, beside Susan Sontags Against Interpretation. How do you say, In your dreams, girlfriend in Arabic? Keith Uhlich]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[From the director of Gladiator! screams the posters, and youd be forgiven for expecting a medieval rerun of that Oscar-winning hit  a film that swaps togas and short swords for Lincoln green and feathered arrows. But this Robin Hood is a more unpredictable beast. While the shakycam action sequences, effete young villain and moody presence of Russell Crowe hark back to the earlier film, this is far closer to Scotts ambitious but unloved Kingdom of Heaven in its depiction of a world ruled by brute force and striving for moral direction.Fighting his way back from the Crusades in the army of Richard the Lionheart, archer Robin Longstride decides to head for home when the King gets an arrow in the neck. By a series of unbelievable coincidences, Robin finds himself posing as deceased nobleman Robert Locksley, charged with taking news of the Lionhearts death back to his troublesome brother, the new King John (Oscar Isaac).This kickstarts the long series of subterfuges, political dirty deals and full-scale treachery that constitute the wildly convoluted storyline. Its plots aplenty: King John plots against his former Chancellor, Marshall (a stately William Hurt); traitor Godfrey (Mark Strong) plots against John, Robin and the entire English nation in concert with the devious King Philip of France; while Maid Marian (Cate Blanchett) and her ailing father-in-law (Max von Sydow) plot to keep Robin in Nottingham in the guise of the former Lord Locksley.Confused? You will be. Anyone expecting a straightforward woodland beat-em-up will be bemused and most likely dismayed by the intricacies of the narrative, particularly when it becomes clear that Scott has been forced to trim back the action to fit in all these dastardly goings-on. Add a complete absence of characterisation, some laughable accents (Crowe in particular sounds hilarious), a sense of history that would make period experts weep, and youve got the makings of what should be a tedious, overblown disaster.But for all its faults, the film has redeeming features. First, its aesthetically convincing, with the English landscape looking more lush and magical than it has done on screen for a long time, particularly in a clutch of gorgeous moonlit night scenes. And while characterisation has been cut to the bone, Crowe, Blanchett, Strong and especially von Sydow remain eminently watchable, with strong, likeable support from such talents as Mark Addy (Friar Tuck) and Matthew Macfadyen, who plays a marvellously greasy Sheriff of Nottingham.Best of all, the film just feels huge: genuinely epic in a way few movies have since The Lord of the Rings. The endless plot twists may be perplexing, but they work to make the movie feel eventful and involving: after 140 minutes, audiences will feel like theyve been somewhere, and lived through something worthwhile.

      <review><![CDATA[Hands up who ever thought theyd see the director of Four Weddings and a Funeral making a Jerry Bruckheimer movie  and a video game adaptation to boot?As with his instalment in the Harry Potter saga, Mike Newell was clearly brought in to add a touch of dramatic gravitas to this flimsiest of summer blockbusters. Its a strategy which pays off  but only just.  The plot feels cobbled together from myriad sources: a pinch of The Thief of Baghdad, a smattering of The Mummy and a hefty dollop of The Thousand and One Nights. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Dastan, a one-time street urchin (natch) elevated to Persian Princeling by the generosity of good King Sharaman. But when Dastan goes against his two brothers and their scheming uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley, whose moustache is just too short to twirl malevolently), hes framed for the kings murder and flees into the desert with only his camel and a bad-tempered princess (Gemma Arterton) for company.  As this synopsis suggests, Newell and his screenwriters leave no historical fantasy cliché unmolested, and thats before we get to the mystical dagger, the supernatural assassins and Alfred Molina as a jolly, morally dubious gambler. The story does feel overfamiliar and suffers from a lack of dramatic tension as a consequence. Matters arent helped by shoddy CGI and some seriously silly last-act developments.  But Newell keeps things moving at a lick, barely allowing his actors a pause for breath between bouts of knockabout banter before chucking them into another athletic action scene. And Gyllenhaal is good value, his natural vulnerability working to offset some slightly alarming action-hero abs. Prince of Persia wont linger long in the memory  but then it probably wasnt meant to.

      <review><![CDATA[Boo-hoo for these 'losers'. Here are some of the cool things they do: they fire large, exotic, presumably illegal weapons off the top of city buildings. They flirt with sinewy Zoe Saldana, who, between her updated Uhura in Star Trek and Navi princess in Avatar, has hit the nerd sweet spot. And, most enviably, they exist in a world where they dont have to watch The Losers  and weep for the vanilla trashiness that dominates our mainstream.  There has to be a term coined for these bloodless, gung-ho superteam movies, crap like Fantastic Four and G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, films that seem inspired by South Parks puppeteered Team America: World Police but without the irony. Plastic explosives, maybe?Blithely destructive of foreign lands and as smooth as a Ken dolls crotch, The Losers is the ultimate example, scraped from the bottom of the comic-book barrel, where writer Andy Diggles figurine-like characters first had their exploits in an exciting War on Terror. Theres commando leader Clay (Watchmens rakish Jeffrey Dean Morgan), demolitions expert Roque (Idris Elba, paying bills), motormouthed jokester Jensen (Chris Evans)  and here I really must stop before I begin to sound like a Mattel salesman.  You can choose to follow the plot after an initial Bolivian black-op goes bad and the squad is abandoned by the CIA (bummer), but such exercises are pointless. Load up on popcorn and wait for the coma to hit. Youve got devilish Jason Patric providing occasional distraction as a snarky, under-utilised villain named Max. Every once in a while, a generic computerised effect goes off, making you wonder about the air-conditioned lives of moviemakers.This summer, were also getting a big-screen The A-Team; heres the D-Team.

      <review><![CDATA[Hannah Montana goes goth and angry for the first 20 minutes or so of this gooey mix of summer-lovin teen romance and three-handkerchief weepie. But under that rebellious exterior and the layers of jewellery and sneers, Ronnie (Cyrus) is just a teen wounded by her parents divorce. Shes also, by the way, a talented pianist with an open offer from Juilliard. Forced to spend the summer with her father, Steve, and little brother Jonah (Coleman) at Dads house on the Georgia coast, Ronnie quickly sheds her mopey pose after meeting local hunk Will (Hemsworth). In short order, theyre frolicking along the beach like a modern-day Frankie and Annette. Working from his novel, Nicholas Sparks and co-screenwriter Jeff van Wie have larded on the plot twists. Will appears to be a beachfront lothario, using his stock lines on Ronnie. But wait! Hes actually just acting out of pain over the recent death of his brother. Steve is working on a stained-glass window for a church that burned down a year ago. But wait! Everyone in town believes he burned it down. A local girl frames Ronnie for shoplifting. But wait! Said girl needs help escaping an abusive boyfriend. And on and on it goes, as if Sparks didnt trust any single plotline to carry us. The last 30 minutes are an extended weep-fest designed to extract maximum tears with minimum originality. The eight-year-old sitting next to us, clearly drawn to the advance screening by the siren song of Miley, sobbed huge, traumatised gulping sobs the whole time. Her emotional response was far more heartfelt than anything onscreen deserved. Hank Sartin]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Wasnt it only yesterday that Dakota Fanning shrieked her way into your splitting headache in War of the Worlds? She was just 11 back then, and in this fast-and-loose dramatisation of the flameout of the 1970s proto-grrrl group, shes all of 15. Fannings co-star, vamp bait Kristen Stewart, isnt that much more experienced (she can vote). The two make for an uncomfortably tarted-up frontline as, respectively, blond yowler Cherie Currie and future Blackhearts frontlady Joan Jett. Its exactly as it should be; the bands story is a cautionary one. So if you feel yourself getting protective, the movie is doing its job. The two underage characters meet, naturally, in a bar over drinks, shoved together by creepy LA entrepreneur Kim Fowley (Revolutionary Roads Shannon, the only truly anarchic presence in the whole film). Soon enough, theyre crammed into a motorhome with the rest of the band, working on chord ch-ch-changes and sliding inexorably toward drugs, soft-core lesbian sex and Japanese fame. The film mainly glances on these surfaces  its more giggly goofy than coke-in-the-bathroom naughty. (Only vinyl collectors will insist that a serious legacy has been sullied; the plot is as contrived as the group itself.) So you dont blink an eye when the prefab wheels run off the rails  theres very little pathos here for something presumably informed by Curries 1989 memoir. Still, you do get a sense of the moment when glam was being fought out in American high schools, and teen sex was barely contained in tight pants. Theres lots of volume in these tunes  the soundtrack is killer  and at least everyone gets their rocks off. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Sam Mendes began shooting Away We Go while the editing suite was still warm from Revolutionary Road. You can imagine why, after that gruelling anatomy of a failed marriage, he was drawn to the story of a happy and well-adjusted, if under-prepared, couple on the threshold of family life. Lets hope it was more fun to make, anyway, because its pretty insufferable to watch.The script, by husband and wife Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida, follows semi-slacker thirtysomethings Burt (Krasinski) and Verona (Rudolph) as they search for the perfect site to raise their unborn child, zipping from Arizona to Wisconsin, Colorado to Carolina. Along the way, they encounter relatives and old friends including Burts hippy-dippy parents (Daniels and OHara), his neo-feminist childhood pal (Gyllenhaal), Veronas braying former colleague (Janney), and two old buddies (Chris Messina and Melanie Lynskey) with their adopted kids in tow.Krasinski and Rudolph are amiable company, and theres nice scenic photography from Ellen Kuras (shot mostly in Connecticut). But the films laboured humour and self-satisfaction grate, as does its twee indie-acoustic soundtrack. That every supporting character is depicted as unbearable or pitiable or both would be bad enough; whats worse is that the couple discover nothing about themselves that wasnt obvious from the opening, unless you count the banal dictum that theres no place like home. A screenplay that jokes about the lack of tension between its leads should at least have something to say about their interaction with the rest of the world. This doesnt. Ben Walters]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Sunnyside, the day-care center where the delightful new Toy Story  occurs, might be a paradiseespecially for Woody (Hanks), Buzz (Allen) and a gang facing obsolescence. (Andy is off to college and his mom has broken out the Hefty bags.) 

But in the sternly orotund warning of one Mr. Pricklepants (ex-Bond Timothy Dalton), its a place of ruin and despair, peopled with violent, drooling tykes and ruled with a plush fist by Lots-o-Huggin Bear (the extraordinary Beatty), whose strawberry scent and harmonica-swaddled folksiness hide a sadist.  

Clearly, Pixars genius for adventurous storytelling continues unabated; a prison film would seem to be the furthest idea from safe, but the tale (by director Lee Unkrich, John Lasseter and Wall-Es Andrew Stanton) poses a serious challenge to the old saw of terrible second sequels. 

As always, the fun with this franchise comes from elaborate sequences of escape, stressing the plastic, resourceful nature of our heroes. This third chapter has some doozies, especially the jaw-dropper where spy Mr. Potato Head slips out of his skin, reassembling in the body of a floppy tortilla. (Watch out for that pesky pigeon, though.)  

Why, then, are we not quite at the highest rank? Theres no avoiding the dark twinge of rejection that such a story inevitably courts; there are momentsthe toys wandering through a dumps wasteland of fire and swirling trashwhen you might be reminded of Steven Spielbergs depressing robot fantasia Artificial Intelligence. 

Still, humanity shines through the brighter comic lines. Authority derives from the consent of the governed, not by force! shouts a small, firm voice; her name is Barbie, and even Ken is stunned. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Jay Baruchel is the gentlest of the Apatow geeklings, more a mascot to sweathogs like Seth Rogen than an equal (his spindly boxer in Million Dollar Baby looked beatable by even Hilary Swank). So it makes sense that Baruchels first star vehicle, a twitchy, frequently funny affair, emphasises the scrawn factor. 

Shes Out of My League casts him as a polite Pittsburgh airport-security worker, Kirk, dwarfed by the epaulettes on his uniform and the pushy advice of his man-gang. When bombshell traveller Molly (Eve) makes her way through the gate, shes seen as a human being only by Kirk, who returns her iPhone and boggles at the possibility of her being attracted to him.
You might feasibly expect  indeed, hope for  this to play out like a zanier Say Anything (judging from Baruchels rawness, he does, too). But were hardly in that romantic ballpark; the promising material, penned by the writers of the under-rated Sex Drive, skews closer to Farrelly brothers slapstick than sweetness. 

One gag involving a loving act of grooming by a heterosexual friend will make you want to vomit; you sense that The Hangover loomed large over this production. Still, Eve has a true flair for zingers, and the movies heart survives intact. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[So whos playing the Emilio Estevez role? Jude Law? Forget it  this nasty non-thriller shares nothing but a similar title with Alex Coxs nutty 1984 head trip through LA, and mores the pity. 

Here, were in that gone-to-pot near-future so beloved of filmmakers, where Law and Whitaker are pals and colleagues working in a debt-recovery department with a difference: they recover human organs. 

The film pitches friend against friend as Law ends up with a new ticker and darts about town with fellow post-op target Alice Braga in tow. Ideas, excitement and logic are ditched in favour of blood and gore  and theres no fun to be had watching operations and knife fights. 

Law and Whitaker are disastrous in the lead roles. Its a dreary and violent film that betrays its three years spent on the shelf. Dave Calhoun]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The post-Poppins supernanny returns thanks to capable screenwriter-star Emma Thompson, whos set the story during World War Two when daddies are away fighting, and children man the home front.

Down on the farm, Maggie Gyllenhaals Mrs Green is at a loss when her three terrors are joined by their posh cousins, evacuated from the threat of bombs over Kensington, though its not long before ex-military Nanny McPhee instils improving discipline. 

The mix is similar to the first film, naughtiness versus magic, but nimbler this time as it shuttles from class warfare to unscrupulous spivs (draft-dodging well-dodgy uncle Rhys Ifans) and the prospect of enemy attack. 

Its bitty and rather light on mounting excitement, yet Thompson the writer smuggles in cheery elements of Enid Blyton and A Little Princess, the frolicking Old Spot piglets are a delight, and Nannys resourceful jackdaw Edelweiss a cult hero in the making. 

Director Susanna White, surely one to watch, manages some disarming emotional grace notes under the circumstances. Trevor Johnson]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Out of the shadows of Mamma Mia! creeps this hysterically silly, sun-soaked yarn of love lost and found in Italy with a story that feels like its been scribbled on the side of a jar of Ragu and an approach to filming Italy thats been nicked from an old Cornetto ad. 

Sophie (Amanda Seyfried; yes, this wants to be Mamma Mia! without songs) is a lowly fact-checker at The New Yorker who takes a pre-wedding trip to Verona with her restaurateur boyfriend Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal, smiling and waving his hands about like a nutter). But, once in Europe, Gael is off snouting for truffles and Sophie is left to discover a cadre of writers who ritually reply to notes left at the citys shrine to Shakespeares Juliet. 

Soon, Sophie is penning one such note herself to Claire (Vanessa Redgrave, distinguished amid the nonsense), an elderly Brit whose letter to an Italian sweetheart has been sitting behind a brick for decades. And what do you know? Claire turns up to search the Italian countryside with Sophie for her long-lost Lorenzo  along with her grumpy hunk of a grandson, Charlie (Christopher Egan, actually Australian, which explains why he acts like a surfboard).  

Is there any point wondering why some of these actors ignored the script and agreed to spend several weeks working in the glorious Italian countryside? But thank heavens for small mercies: someone must have realised in the edit that they might have a kitsch classic on their hands as theres at least a knowing sense of camp alongside the dire performances and corny plotting.

      <review><![CDATA[In the first Karate Kid (a movie that should now be considered a classic), teenage Daniel and his Jersey mom settle in Reseda, a modest California suburb thats as Valley as they come. Its a crucial bit of character shading, separating our hero from his wealthier peers, including the cheerleader he falls for. 

Todays updated Kid goes an ocean further, exporting its black Detroit youngster Dre (Smith) all the way to scrubbed-up Beijing, where his braided hair gets fondled and his race is a novelty. Hes also, unambiguously, a kid: all of 12 and hardly the man of the house. 

But that lump-in-the-throat feeling is the same as before, as the outsider tale receives an unexpectedly sensitive tweenification, transformed into a small-dude adventure that stresses dignity over coolness. (Todays actual teens are way too cynical for what once worked in the Age of Macchio.) 

Credit better-than-good Jaden Smith, accessing a wealth of emotion, aside from moments when hes been coached to come off more like his dad, Will. Hes young enough to weep and want to go home; fittingly, Jackie Chan is, for once, acting his age, slouching as Mr. Han, a handyman requiring a rebirth.

Sometimes the parts dont quite slide into place as they used to, especially when the script insists on its budding romance. (Adorable Wenwen Han dances to Lady Gaga and suddenly the movie explodes into a weird sexuality.) Plus, youll miss sweep the leg and the Crane. Yet given the dreck weve seen this summer, its nice to be reminded of the virtues of clean storytelling and cultural curiosity. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[All three of you clamoring for a sequel to Wild Wild West have got your wish: Jonah Hexan adaptation of the DC Comics series about a Western antihero with otherworldly abilitiesgives that Fresh Princestarring disaster from 1999 a run for its wasted money. 

Occupying a similarly alternate 19th-century universe, Hex (Brolin) is a horribly scarred bounty hunter out for the blood of the man who murdered his family, Quentin Turnbull (Malkovich). But its not simply a matter of revenge, since Turnbull has a monomaniacal plan to use an Eli Whitneyinvented weapon of mass destruction (a cannonball-hurling side project to that silly ol cotton gin) against President Ulysses S. Grant (Aidan Quinn).  

Whats a guy who can interrogate the dead to do? Fuck Megan Fox, of course. Then its off on a nonsensical progression of adventures that reach their apex when a handy group of Indianssort of the AAA roadside assistance for the recently deceasedbrings Hex back from the beyond. He inhales some digital smoke, coughs up a crow and shouts a Shatneresque Turnbull!!! 

And then? Howzabout a rushed steamboat-of-death finale involving the plastic-bag-loving videographer from American Beauty, Colonel Daniels from The Wire and Gob Bluth from Arrested Development? But by that point youll hopefully be passed out from all the pocket-flask shots youve swigged to survive this hex of a flick. Keith Uhlich]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Taking a page from the Dawn of the Dead 04 playbook, this entertainingly shallow remake of George A. Romeros 1973 horror film opens with a clever use of Johnny Cash (crooning the Dr. Strangeloveclosing ditty, Well Meet Again), then jumps right into the societal breakdown. A man goes nuts at a baseball game. Our hero sheriff (Olyphant) shoots him through the noggin. Seems theres a destructive force, later determined to be a government-engineered virus, working its way through this small Midwest American town.  

Director Breck Eisner (Sahara) has a talent for in-the-moment tension (theres some pretty memorable business with a pitchfork and an autopsy saw), and it often feels like the characters are plunging headlong through a grisly Rube Goldberg gauntlet. All of which is a lot of fun, until the realization sets in that very little is going on beyond the fright-feature anxieties.  

Unlike Romeros film, whats missing is a trenchant sense of connection to our historical moment. The original Crazies perceptively shuttled back and forth between bureaucratically hampered Army men and a paranoid populace; it had Vietnam firmly on its mind. Here, the goal is clearthe sheriff and his pregnant wife (Mitchell) need to get the fuck out of Dodgebut the world around them is a half-baked hash of antimilitarist sentiment and goosey jump-scares: Operation Iraqi Hodgepodge.

      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[Above and beyond its bizarrely styled title  changed to avoid confusion with the Dakota Fanning action film Push  this Sundance winner is a tough sell even for those who like it. The movie is at once irritatingly glib and undeniably bold in its portrait of a late-80s, illiterate Harlem teenager (Sidibe) with no obvious escape route. 

Shes pregnant with her second child by her father; her daughter was born with Downs syndrome and is being raised by her abusive mother, Mary (MoNique), who blames Precious for stealing her husband. Mary also sees Precious as a financial burden and  to humiliate her for her obesity  forces her to overeat.
Producer-turned-director Daniels (his only other feature is the reputedly nutso Shadowboxer) has a tendency to fetishise misery, shooting domestic brawls and child endangerment in a way that seems too arty for comfort. (The sequences representing Preciouss fantasies are particularly cringeworthy.) 

On the other hand, its rare to see such a convincing or poetic portrayal of life on the margins. Eventually, Precious emerges as an unsentimental pro-education film: Precious only way out is to attend a special school, where shes assisted by a patient teacher (Patton) and  outside the classroom  by a social worker (a surprisingly good Carey, whod be unrecognisable if you didnt know she was in the film). 

The movie strains to withhold judgment; even Mary gets a redemptive monologue. The bottom line is that youve never seen anything quite like this  its highs, its lows, its gaffes, its embarrassments or its uplift. Ben Kenigsberg]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[So this is what $533 million buys you. Before I get into hot water: Thats not the budget of Inception, a luxurious slice of future shock that still has room for a preponderance of lovely sun showers. Rather, its the domestic box-office gross of writer-director Christopher Nolans previous movie, The Dark Knight. 

With that bruiser, Nolan, an intellectual prone to wearing trench coats, was vaulted into an echelon occupied only by James Cameron. And like Cameron, the barely-40 filmmaker has now bet the farmall of his industry clouton a fantasy. We may be living in the riskiest of Hollywood days.  

Inception, though, is no Avatarinstead, its the movie that many wanted Avatar to be. In a roaringly fast first hour, were introduced to a new technology that allows for the bodily invasion of another persons dreamworld. Leonardo DiCaprio has been doing this to his female fans for years. Here, as the haunted Dom, a corporate spy, the actor might finally be shorn of that last hint of baby fat thats larded his adult roles. Dom steals secrets, the big billion-dollar ideas. Hes also something of a pill, estranged from his children and a source of worry to his mentor, Miles (the purring Michael Caine, an Alfredian holdover from The Dark Knight): Come back to reality, the elder urges.  

Um, right. Nolan, who worked on his script for a decade and preserved most of its secrets, knows that nobody, least of all the audience, wants that to happen. Inception thus commits to that hoariest (if enjoyable) of conventions, the one last job, in which Dom will do the bidding of a mysterious Japanese energy magnate (Ken Watanabe) who hopes to fend off a younger competitor (Cillian Murphy) by simply having him quit the business. Dom could plant such a notion in his head, and as the film assembles its crazy team of ultraserious geekslike a chemist named Yusuf who makes the necessary sedatives (Dileep Rao) or a maze-building architect (Junos Ellen Page)youll be reminded of such pseudoscientific larks as The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension. (And if you havent seen that bit of cult wonderfulness, get cracking.)  

How can it be that a bunch of people sitting around scheming nonsense can prove so compelling? Only David Fincher knows how to take a studios money and spin it as stylishly as Nolan. First and foremostand with breathtaking verveout go the laws of physics. As in dreams, these cities fold in on themselves and bridges rear up like pissed-off cats. The plan has not yet begun and already, weve gotten an eyeful of slo-mo vertigo.  Yet Inception would be all guff if it didnt strive for the romantic poetry of the great subconscious fantasias, movies like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Chris Markers immortal La Jetée. There is a woman, lurking on the periphery of Doms visions. She has tears in her eyes; sometimes, they hold a saboteurs glare. Mal is her name (shes played by the mighty Edith Piaf portrayer, Marion Cotillard) and we soon learn that she is Doms wife, and dead. Are these manufactured dreamscapes a bold frontier for him, or a private hell of memory?  

Suddenly, the game is onand my advice to you would be to throw away the rule book. Has any movie so lavishly committed to its dream logic as Inception? Certainly not at the multiplex. And honestly, for all its audacity, this might not be a ringing endorsement. A train comes barreling out of nowhere (thats not a metaphor; one really does). Several unconscious characters float weightlessly in an elevator shaft. Pagewhos never allowed to be funny, a mistakegets ski-lodgey in winter whites as a snow fortress is besieged by an armed militia. In short: Help.  

But how refreshing it is to be consumed by a raging ambition, not merely the whoosh of a theaters air-conditioning. Escapism is the goal of the summer seasonindeed, maybe of cinema in generaland Nolan has honoured that pact considerably while also asking much more of us. His latest, like his 2000 breakthrough, Memento, turns our viewership into a prickly challenge of catch-up: Even though Hans Zimmers score blares its tubas with the ominousness of a James Bond soundtrack, this is no mere good-versus-evil shoot-em-up.  

The kick is what Dom calls the moment when his team is jerked awake from its mission. Nolan has made a livelihood out of crafting such kicks (in The Prestige, it was an unfortunate bird, crushed in a magic trick). Does plunging through Inceptions many layers of kicks, symbology and interrupted bliss-outs bring us any closer to a higher truth? Maybe not. But oh, to have such dreams. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Dont let the wayward Oscar nominees fool you; this sex thriller is trapped in a tepid zone between quality trash and pretentious psychodrama. Comfortable Torontonians Catherine (Moore) and Dave (Neeson) eye each other with suspicion through the glass panels of their fractured existence. Is he cheating on her? Catherine, in a fit of pique, hires doe-eyed escort Chloe (Seyfried, out of her limited depths), whom she meets in a restaurant bathroom, to seduce Dave and finally get some closure. (The scheme comes from the 2003 French drama Nathalie, where it didnt make much sense either.)  

Were supposed to tingle when this temptress goes off task, turning lasciviously to Catherine herself and then to the latters sexually active teenage son. But while conceived like the typical predator of these kinds of flicks, the enigmatic character is stranded by Seyfrieds unpersuasive, watery diffidence; even when (briefly) nude, the actor seems way too covered up and unwilling to seize the brass ring of late-night-Skinemax glory, as Drew Barrymore once did in Poison Ivy. 

Directing this painfully arty wreck is Atom Egoyan, whose recent series of misfires suggest hes long forgotten how to make anything as sublime as Exotica. No doubt he looks down upon a film like Basic Instinct, even though its less pseudo-elitist and more secure in its own skin. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Every middle-aged Saturday Night Live alum grazing the wider pastures of Hollywood comes to a big decision: Do you follow the model of Steve Martin and his gaggle of sputum-seeping onscreen progeny and traipse into middlebrow mania? Or, like Bill Murray (and, to a lesser degree, the Mike Myers of The Love Guru), do you pursue your muse even further into go-it-alone weirdness? 

Adam Sandler may have made his choice. After flirting with some fascinating sourness in Judd Apatows Funny People, hes ready to sweeten up a bit; Grown Ups, a benignly crude slice of family hysteria, reunites him with ex-SNLers Chris Rock, David Spade and Rob Schneider (plus obligatory chubster Kevin James), as former 12-year-old basketball teammates drawn together decades later when their coach kicks the bucket.  

Back to their old summer lodge they go, along with several impossibly attractive wives  the breast-feeding Maria Bello; a quietly dominating Maya Rudolph; high-strung fashionista Salma Hayek Pinault (who?)  plus a swarm of carefully written kids destined to wise up in the great outdoors. No viewer goes into this movie expecting John Cassavetess Husbands, least of all from soft-serve director Denis Dugan (You Dont Mess with the Zohan).
 But would it have been such a crushing blow to these stars egos if they accommodated a little honest anxiety, instead of the typical lake-rope-swinging mishaps and an inevitable Steve Buscemi cameo? 

Telegraphed down to the final shot of its hoops climax, Grown Ups suggests a mask being torn off to reveal another one: the male fantasy of cheerleader spouse, well-adjusted kids and expanding waistline, all okey-dokey. Joshua Rothkopf ]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Comedy]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[Its a time-honoured tradition among ageing rock stars with dwindling audiences to go back to the time that made them famous: nostalgia sells.  

Now John Cusack is applying the same shtick to movies: having tried his luck as both action hero and romantic lead, with Hot Tub Time Machine, Cusack returns to the slapdash, high concept 80s comedies that made him famous. 

And concepts dont come much higher than this: following a mysterious incident with an outdoor Jacuzzi and a can of nuclear-powered Russian energy drink, Adam (Cusack) and his three friends find themselves rocketed into the past, forced to relive the craziest night of their teenage lives before they can find a way back to the good old twenty-first century.  

Hot Tub Time Machine conforms a little too closely to the post-The Hangover comedy template of a gang of drunk middle-aged losers with loud voices, bad attitudes and dubious ideas about women. But where this film scores over The Hangover is in the script, which replaces brash overconfidence with a looser narrative structure and a shaggier, more playful sense of humour. 

It also does a great job of recreating the style and content of the 80s comedies it so lovingly pastiches, namely girls with big hair, pounding synth music and skisuit-wearing preppy douchebag villains. Giving his most charming performance in years, Cusack keeps the film sweet-natured when his more outrageous co-star Rob Corddry threatens to go overboard.  No masterpiece, perhaps, but Hot Tub Time Machine is post-pub perfection. Tom Huddleston]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Theres little more humiliating in this line of work than admitting you enjoyed a movie that exists primarily as a merchandising tie-in, but if you can accept the idea of this Sorcerers Apprenticethat is, an iconic Fantasia segment reimagined as a contemporary action film, starring a long-haired but defanged Cage as a thousand-year-old sorcerer and Baruchel as his nerdy-hapless college-age protégéthe movie offers ample fun for your inner eight-year-old. Expect a boatload of Pirates-like sequels.  

Part of it may be that standards are falling. Say what you will about producer Jerry Bruckheimer, but the man has no qualms about dropping coin on convincing special effectsand unlike those in The Last Airbender, these have good color quality. 

Set in New York, the movie shows a fair amount of wit hypothesizing how wizardry would take shape in modern Manhattan, as when a spell reverses all the writing in Times Square. (Geographical and chronological consistency are issues. Is that Chicagos Carbide and Carbon Building?)  

The script could have been written by committee, but its a committee that worships Robert McKee. (Notice those giant, electricity-generating Tesla coils that Baruchels character uses to impress his bombshell would-be girlfriend? Those might come in handy.) And Molina takes more relish in a paycheck role as a wry, cane-wielding villain than anyone would expect. Hell probably laugh all the way to the bank. Ben Kenigsberg]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The UK tosses its hat into the 3D ring with this sweet-natured, London-set dance movie that, if nothing else, proves that gainful employment is within the realms of possibility for the fly-by-night famesters of Britains Got Talent.

Bear-hugging convention with all its might, the film tells of Carly (Nichola Burley) and her attempts to whip her dancing crew in shape for a tournament. She does this by co-opting the help and resources of a compassionate ballet instructor (Charlotte Rampling, looking like shes having fun) who requests that they work on creating a dance routine that fuses the traditional with the modern. 

That the climactic dance resembles something from the dark recesses of Lloyd Webbers dream archive is by the by: the movie has vim and spark in abundance. The filmmakers are canny enough to let the cast play to their strengths by keeping dialogue to a minimum and shoehorning in as many brilliantly choreographed dance sequences as the material will allow.

      <review><![CDATA[The original title of the Stieg Larsson novel which became, in translation, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, was Men Who Hate Women: a blunt but fitting description of this angry, intelligent but curiously uninvolving Swedish shaggy dog story. 

The film sees down-at-heel, crusading journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) hired by industrialist Henrik Vanger to look into the disappearance of his beloved niece more than 30 years before. Blomkvists quest is intercut with the story of Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), a bisexual ex-con cyberpunk computer hacker (only in Sweden!) at the mercy of a corrupt, sexually deviant parole officer.  

Throughout this beautifully photographed, skilfully constructed film theres a sense were skimming lightly 
over Larssons characters and themes. Blomkvist is the putative hero, but his investigative journey is a little too familiar, his character too clean-cut to be compelling. 

Its Salander who holds the attention: superbly played by Rapace, shes a grim, spectral presence in the opening scenes, before shes pushed too far and explodes in a moment of shocking, vengeful violence.  

Such scenes place The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo above the extended TV mystery it easily could have become, but explicit violence only takes you so far. 

At heart this is a traditional thriller, down to a series of convenient and underwhelming last-act revelations. For fans of Larssons books this could be the highlight of the cinemagoing year  for the rest of us its a solid, enjoyable but emotionally unengaging detective story. Tom Huddleston]]></review>

The Expendables is a sluggish, derivative, witless farrago which is laser-targeted to the nostalgia set and would surely have gone straight to DVD were it not for Stallones recent run at the box office with belated sequels to his Rocky and Rambo franchises.  

The Expendables is  once again  about ageing fighters who remain happily out of sync with the modern world, though its more Wild Hogs than No Country For Old Men, concerned less with growing old gracefully than with clinging to a state of perpetual adolescence in which fast cars, tattoos and knifes all remain indescribably cool. 

Sly is Barney Ross, the stogie-chomping front man to a ragtag, cosily diverse unit of jaded, muscle-bound mercenaries who accept jobs that no-one else in their right mind would touch. Stallone has lost much of the loveable-lug lustre of his early years  and seems to have turned into his own 'spitting image' puppet, spending the entire film looking like hes watching a fly perched on the end of his nose.  

We open on the gang dealing with a fleet of Somalian pirates, revealing that  unsurprisingly  diplomacy is not a term in their lexicon. Before you can say, Hey, whats Dolph Lundgren doing with that 12-gauge?, a hostage-taker has been shot through the torso and the whole vessel is submerged in gunfire. And so the depressingly reactionary tone is set, offering the first hint that the title of the film refers as much to the groups view of other human beings as it does to themselves.  

Settling for the most rudimentary of save-the-maiden/topple-the-dicator plotlines and wheeling out tough-guy clichés by rote, innovation and skill are notable by their absence. And as if things werent bad enough, Stallone mysteriously opts to photograph the entire film in extreme close-up, which a) allows you to see just how shallow all the characters are, b) alerts you to the shoddiness of the effects, and c) means that all the action scenes look like an indiscriminate tangle of bloody body parts.   

Elsewhere, pickings remain slim. 

Cameo appearances by Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger serve no function whatsoever bar allowing Stallone to make a cheap allusion to Arnies day job (a Planet Hollywood gag wouldve been funnier), while the inclusion of a romantic sub-plot exists solely to allow Jason Statham to furnish retributive justice on the local wife-beater. 

Theres even a fight scene inspired by a racial stereotype, as Jet Li engages in a warehouse tussle with Lundgren and gains the advantage because hes so short.  Even if Slys sense of irony hadnt been lost in the mail, The Expendables would still be unsalvageable. 

Its a film that exists in a cultural limbo, where life, history and filmmaking appear to have ceased at the moment Ronald Reagan left office. Still, if you like watching men with no necks thumping each other, this could be your Citizen Kane. David Jenkins]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[At first glance, you could mistake this for a mainstream Hollywood romcom: handsome con artist accepts money from rich parents who want him to stand in the way of their beloved daughter and her unsuitable beau. He charms her, she realises she can do better, he invents a sob story about a broken heart and swiftly departs with a wallet full of cash. 

This, however, is a French film, so theres a blissful lack of Dane Cook types peddling crude sex gags. Instead, we have the comically talented French thesp Romain Duris as the charming Alex, and Vanessa Paradis as Juliette, his latest mark  a woman who could actually break his heart. 

Juliette is engaged to a posh Brit, Jonathan (Lincoln, not great), but her dad objects, and assigns Alex to intervene and pose as her bodyguard. 

Its an instantly amusing setup: Duris is terrific as the suave trickster assisted by his sister and her husband, a comical duo who set up surveillance devices to research Alexs targets. 

The opening scene is hilarious: Alex poses as a heartbroken doctor delivering medicine to needy villagers, all of whom are in on the act. For Juliette, he must memorise the Dirty Dancing routine and Wham! lyrics. More farcical laughs come courtesy of Juliettes drunken nympho friend, who inconveniently sets her sights on Alex. 

Problem is, Alex and Juliette never look like a credible love match. Paradis is an enigmatic presence, her characters true feelings never apparent. When Heartbreaker goes for real romance, it falters. When it goes for laughs, it hits the mark. A mixed bag, then, but still an accessible comedy that outstrips its similarly conceived US counterparts. Anna Smith]]></review>
