      <review><![CDATA[Action movie addicts who do evil in this life should be forced to watch Bright Star over and over in the next. Because it seems to have been laboratory-assembled from all those things that annoy people most about costume dramas. It's slow - oh yes, it's slow. There are pretty frocks aplenty; Abbie Cornish changes costume so often it's almost a running gag. There are close-ups of butterflies perching on half-oranges, and characters who say things like "There is a holiness to the heart's affections." It may be a gross exaggeration to say that period films contain little but chaste lovers reciting poems to each other before dying gracefully of consumption, but in Bright Star, this actually happens. It's Hampstead, London in 1818. John Keats (Ben Whishaw), 23 years old and yet to be recognised as one of the greatest of all the romantic poets, falls in love with his 18-year-old neighbour, Fanny Brawne (Cornish). This vexes Brawne's mother (Kerry Walker) because Keats has no money. It also displeases Keats' close friend Charles Brown (a magnetic Paul Schneider), because Brown knows that an attachment will force his comrade to take up a vulgar profession such as medicine and turn away from verse-making.The passionately unconsummated affair that unfolds sees Keats and Brawne exchanging notes, walking in the countryside, reading poetry, and taking part in lovingly constructed tableaux reminiscent of 19th century paintings (as photographed by Greig Fraser, the brilliant lensman of Last Ride). They endure the agony of separation, first through choice and then through death. Life in Georgian England was cruelly short but also cruelly boring, and Campion captures the monotonous rhythms of a time when to receive a letter could be the highlight of one's week.  Sad and anaemic as it is, there's much that is mesmerising about Bright Star. Ben Whishaw's Keats is lean, saturnine and tortured; a chic geek, he has narrow, coal-black eyes that dart back and forth distractedly when recalling a poem, as if reading the lines from a ghostly autocue. Sloe-eyed Abbie Cornish, as the dressmaker who struggles to penetrate the mysteries of Keats' verse and captures his heart, is ravishing as always. This is yet another film that harnesses her abilities both to gaze meaningfully into the distance and break down in disturbingly deep fits of anguish. I hope for her sake she does a comedy next.Campion's movie is rooted in the gritty realities of 19th century existence: a world where life would be unbearable without the power of the imagination. She approaches every scene in a fresh, off-kilter fashion, less like a historian than a poet herself. That's the secret to Bright Star's slow-burning power: it's not so much a biopic as an ode.

      <review><![CDATA[This portrait of the artist as a young man takes a few liberties. Screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh (Control) implies that Lennon was estranged from his biological mother until the age of 15, when, in actuality, Julia Lennon was a major presence in her son's childhood. The change is meant to strengthen the tension between the prim Aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott-Thomas), who raised John from the age of five, and the wilder, flirtier Julia (Anne-Marie Duff). The two women, we're meant to believe, represent the opposing forces that made Lennon the iconoclast he was: a product of a repressive era who burst free spectacularly.Thus Nowhere Boy has teenage John (Aaron Johnson) reconnecting with Julia following the death of his beloved Uncle George (David Threlfall). While Mimi tut-tuts in the background, Julia introduces John to American rock'n'roll ("know what it means, ‘rock'n'roll'? Sex," she reveals) and teaches him to play the banjo. Soon John is forming his first band, the skiffle outfit the Quarrymen. Though the Beatles are never so much as name-checked in Nowhere Boy, cheeky references are scattered throughout: the walrus that Lennon doodles in his school notebook, a sign for ‘Strawberry Fields,' and his mother's rendition of the folk song ‘Maggie Mae' on the banjo (a song that would later appear on the Beatles' final studio album Let It Be). Fans will also be amused by the epochal first meeting between Lennon and the lanky, awkward Paul McCartney (Thomas Brodie Sangster of Love Actually) - it's the first moment when Lennon's confidence in his own superiority is shaken. Aaron Johnson nails Lennon's mercurial temper and withering wit, while Scott Thomas and Duff offer complex portrayals of two fascinating women. And yet, there's something just a bit incomplete about Nowhere Boy. Since the audience comes armed with the foreknowledge of Lennon's impending superstardom, everything we learn about his struggles as a teenager takes on a gravity that it simply wouldn't possess if the story were just about a nameless, mixed-up Liverpool teen. Nevertheless, director Sam Taylor-Wood (a Turner Prize-nominated artist) makes every shot of her debut feature look like an award-winning photograph. The movie is also a joy to listen to, stuffed full of all the classic rock'n'roll that inspired Lennon - Elvis, Screamin' Jay Hawkins and Buddy Holly. The near-absence of Beatles songs is no drawback here. Michelle Lamont]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA["Wait a minute...was that in the book or the movie?" Peter Jackson
asks himself, then bursts out laughing. The 48-year-old director is
musing aloud over the phone, and he's momentarily forgotten where the
derivation line ends regarding his latest project - a mostly faithful
adaptation of Alice Sebold's best-selling 2002 novel, The Lovely Bones - and
its source material. "My God, it's been so long that, to be honest, I
get the specific details of each muddled."
Strict word-for-word
fidelity was never the goal when Jackson and his longtime cowriters,
Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, dug into Sebold's dark thriller about a
deceased teenage girl who's looking back on her cut-short life from
beyond the grave. ("I was 14 when I was murdered on December 6th,
1973," goes the second line of the book; it only gets bleaker from
there.) Some of the film's tweaks are major, some slight, and some - like
the character's spectral flight from the scene of the crime - open the
tale in unexpectedly moving ways. "People may take issue with any
changes, even the small ones. But the more honest way to approach
something like this is: I am a reader, and here's what I got out of the
book. Let's capture the ways it affected me, rather than replicate
every comma. That's what we did with the Lord of the Rings films; that's what we tried to do here." Jackson was working on The Two Towers, the second instalment in the groundbreaking Rings trilogy, when Boyens impulsively picked up the novel as she was
boarding a 30-hour flight from New Zealand to London. After Walsh and
the director also read Sebold's tragedy and, in his words, "finally
stopped crying over the last ten pages," they inquired about the
rights. A script with Lynne Ramsay (Ratcatcher) attached was in the works, so Jackson &amp; Co. set their sights on making a long-promised King Kong remake. When Ramsay ended up dropping out of the production for
undisclosed reasons several years later, the screenwriting trio quickly
made it their next post-Kong project. Now they just had to
figure out how to turn a beloved literary work with a
purgatory-stranded protagonist into a watchable movie."That was
the challenge, wasn't it?" Jackson says. "You don't finish this
powerful piece of fiction and say: Well, here's this beautifully
structured narrative that will translate immediately into film. But to
me, every movie is a puzzle to be solved. It wouldn't be easy, but
that's half the fun." Given that The Lovely Bones offers the wide-eyed Susie (Atonement's
Saoirse Ronan) a grisly demise courtesy of the neighborhood pedophile
(Stanley Tucci, in übercreepy mode), and then toggles between her being
lost in limbo and her grieving family, fun isn't the first
word that comes to mind. The film is completely original, however,
especially in the hallucinogenic "in-between" sequences of spooky,
symbolic landscapes that make up a third of the film.
Jackson sounds giddy as
he describes the "map" he and his cowriters used in designing those
computer-generated scenes, which involved a symbol legend based on
extensive dream-analysis research, but he also emphasises that
state-of-the-art visual effects are useless if they don't serve the
story. "Critics in particular treat CGI as a virus that's infecting
film," the director admits. "But as something that can help bring a
script to life, it can be remarkably effective. You could conceivably
portray an alternate universe dictated by a 14-year-old girl stuck
between heaven and earth without special effects, I guess, but why not
use every imaginative tool available to you?" It's doubtful
that such tools will be left in the bag for Jackson's next big
adaptation: cowriting and producing the two-movie take of The Hobbit to be directed by Guillermo del Toro. "The first film's script is in to
Warner Bros," Jackson confirms. "And after we get back from promoting Bones,
we expect to have the second film's script done by New Year's and start
shooting next summer. I was worried about going back to Middle-Earth
after so long, to be honest, but it's been great. I feel like things
have somehow managed to work out exactly like they're supposed to." He
pauses. "Someone definitely seems to be watching over me." David Fear

      <review><![CDATA[Wes Anderson's movies include The Royal Tenenbaums, Rushmore and The Darjeeling Limited. They typically involve a large number of characters, droll dialogue, and Bill Murray. Fantastic Mr Fox is no exception, but it represents a major technical leap: an ambitious stop-motion animation for all ages that critics are acclaiming as his best work yet. What made you want to adapt Fantastic Mr Fox?This was the first book I ever personally owned. It was a book I loved as a child and that introduced me to Roald Dahl's work, so it made a big impression on me. Then about ten years ago I approached Felicity Dahl, Roald Dahl's wife, and asked for permission to do it. What exactly was it about the story that you loved? The thing that I love is a character that is a thread through Dahl's works: these fathers who are often a bit shady. They don't respect authority and they love to break the rules. In his autobiography you get that sense that he didn't really accept anybody's rules.Great cast. How difficult were they to assemble?It wasn't easy. [Laughs]. Bill Murray and Owen [Wilson] and Jason [Schwartzman] are guys who I have known for a long time, so that's one thing, but if you have George Clooney that really brings some power to the cast.What made you think of Clooney? I've always been a fan, and as soon as the script was done I thought, well, who is going to be Mr Fox? And I thought Cary Grant would have been good. But then in 20 seconds of thinking of Cary Grant we were talking about George Clooney. I discovered that he has the most wonderful voice.How overwhelming was this project?There are a million decisions, more than a live-action movie. People are making decisions not in a moment-to-moment basis but in a frame-to-frame basis and everything is just more intricate. And there's 29 units going at once. It was insane. Part of the script was written at Dahl's actual house in Buckinghamshire; why?I'd visited there and it occurred to me that it might be very inspiring for Noah [Baumbach, co-writer] and I to start our writing there. We also thought we'd see what we'd pick up, and in fact we modelled the whole movie on that place and the area around it. Why did you decide to record the voices outside rather than in a studio?I wanted it to be very natural and sort of like a documentary. All the actors were together and would talk at the same time as people do. If the scene took place by a river, we recorded it by a river. That's probably an unusual way to do it.What were your inspirations for the film?There's an animated film called Le Roman de Renard [1930] that was a great influence on us because one of the animation techniques they use is to have multiple sizes and scales. So there are puppets that are a couple of inches high and puppets that are eighteen inches high. They're meant to be the same character, but different scales for close-ups or wide shots. It's very charming. That was something we stole. Gaynor FlynnFantastic Mr Fox screens from 1 Jan]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[I suppose, if you're going to be fired, then you may as well be fired by George Clooney. Who among us could sit opposite Hollywood's lovable scallywag and not accept a redundancy package like it was an offer of a weekend in Vegas? As Ryan Bingham, a professional ‘career transition counsellor', Clooney criss-crosses the continental United States, laying off employees for corporations that would prefer not to soil their hands with the task. Termination is his business and in recession-hit America business is good. Like death with a smile and a handshake instead of a scythe, he rides the pale horse of the airways, with no personal goals but the kudos of clocking up ten million frequent flyer miles. Bingham is at home in departure lounges and hotel rooms, bypassing lengthy check-in queues because of his valued-customer status and navigating security checks with the elegance of a ballet dancer. He even moonlights as a motivational speaker, giving a lecture titled ‘What's in Your Backpack?' that espouses the virtues of an unencumbered life. His carefree existence leaves him free for casual dalliances with fellow business travellers like Alex (Vera Farmiga), with whom he bonds in a hotel bar over a comparison of the virtues of rental car companies Hertz and Maestro. Relationships, to Ryan, are excess baggage, but Alex comes without strings: "Think of me as yourself, only with a vagina," she assures him.   His perverse love of constant travel comes under threat when a brittle young colleague, Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), wants to implement a system of firing via Skype, thus saving millions in airfares. Bingham prefers to sack people face to face, which in the film's skewed logic makes him a kind of saint. Agreeing that Natalie lacks practical experience of letting people go, her boss (Jason Bateman) sends her out with Bingham to learn the ropes of the career transition business.Up in the Air asks us to sympathise with a man who has no friends, a lousy relationship with his sisters, and a shitty job that involves ruining people's lives. Perhaps only Clooney, and director Jason Reitman, could pull this off. (Reitman made a tobacco-industry lobbyist likeable in Thank You for Smoking, and teenage pregnancy a cause for breezy banter in Juno.) But what goes up must come down, and when Bingham starts to have feelings for Alex, inviting her to his sister's wedding, you know that the movie's final destination won't be that far from Redemption City, Arizona.  Based on a novel by Walter Kirn, this is a thoughtful romantic comedy steeped in the harsh ironies of 21st century business - how travel gets us nowhere, how communication technologies isolate us, and how it's easy to mistake a job for a life. Performances are really fine - especially from the casually seductive Farmiga - and visually, it's a blast, with Eric Steelberg's camera capturing spectacular bird's-eye views of American cities. Up in the Air reinforces the fact that the appeal of air travel is much like the appeal of being single: full of exciting possibilities, but a real drag after a while. Everybody needs a co-pilot.

It's true that the athletes-among them Shaun White, Travis Pastrana and Bob Burnquist-are all freakishly fearless, awe-inspiring and yes, often airborne.

      <review><![CDATA[Best wipe 8 1/2 from your mind, or at least delay seeing Fellini's loopy masterpiece, if you're going to enjoy this angsty romp through the director's 1963 film about a fictional Italian filmmaker, Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis), who loses his mojo and might be about to lose his marbles and his marriage.Surprisingly, though, there's lots in this musical version, itself an adaptation of a 1980s Broadway show, that relates to the sombre heart of Fellini's original. We still get Guido's formative childhood memory of watching a prostitute perform on the beach (although this time it is Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas brilliantly belting out the film's foot-tapping anthem Be Italian). We also get the lingering ghost of his mother (Sophia Loren!), the pain of his adultery and the madness of his creative impasse. Also, Fellini's meshing of dream and reality is oddly suited to the unreal tendencies of a musical, although it's anybody's guess what the director would have made of Penélope Cruz throwing herself around in stockings and suspenders and upping the sex factor beyond anything Claudia Cardinale offered in the original.
The biggest difference, though, is that almost 50 years later, director Rob Marshall (Chicago) is able to play the story of 8 1/2 as a nostalgia piece. He fetishises the look and feel of 1960s Italy and especially Rome so that the film's mood of artistic melancholia is expressed on a canvas that comes dangerously close to looking like an ad for Italian coffee. Marshall and his writers, including the late Anthony Minghella, also stress the humour of Guido's philandering, often preferring that his inner turmoil goes no further than chain-smoking. To give Day-Lewis his due, the actor grounds the film's sillier tendencies in a charming performance of mercurial despair. He's well supported by Marion Cotillard, who conveys the sadness of being Guido's wife, although both Nicole Kidman as his leading lady and Kate Hudson as an admiring journalist are little more than window-dressing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[There's a breed of character in UK humour that has invective down to a fine art: the Basil Fawlties, the Blackadders, the Bernard Blacks. To that glorious lineage add Malcolm Tucker (Peter Capaldi), the PM's director of communications from In the Loop, the thunderously funny debut film by Armando Iannucci. Tucker is a foul-mouthed monster prowling the corridors of power: when a colleague uses the word "purview" he erupts, "This is a government department, not some fucking Jane fucking Austen novel! Allow me to pop a jaunty little bonnet on your purview and ram it up your..." Iannucci created Tucker for the 2005 BBC sitcom The Thick of It, basing him on Tony Blair's feared press secretary Alistair Campbell. "He's notorious for swearing, and also for ringing journalists at 1.30am and saying ‘I'm about to get you sacked,'" the director explains. "Campbell and others are this new breed of enforcers - Karl Rove was the Bush one. On paper they're in charge of getting the government's message across, but gradually they take over and start telling ministers what the policies are."In the Loop resurrects the character for a feature-length swipe at the kind of machinations that led to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. With Downing Street and Washington both itching to send troops into an unnamed Middle Eastern country, a bumbling minister, Simon Foster (Tom Hollander), lets slip a comment on TV that seems to back war. After much bollocking by Tucker, Foster is dispatched to America to take part in the US government's secret ‘Future Planning Committee' (War Council). Foster idealistically believes he can prevent the conflict, which is also opposed by the Pentagon's General Miller (James Gandolfini) and the US Assistant Secretary for Diplomacy (Mimi Kennedy). But then Tucker arrives to manipulate events. "We didn't want it to be seen as about Iraq," Iannucci says. "It's a comedy, and comedy is all about exaggeration, so you make things up, and then politicians come up to you and say, ‘How did you find that out?' It's a worrying, worrying thing."A veteran writer of seminal TV comedies The Day Today and I'm Alan Partridge, Scottish-born Iannucci researched the film in Washington where he was shocked by the youth of so many government powerbrokers. "I met a 22 year old who was sent to Baghdad to help draw up the constitution of Iraq. He was 22." The idea of unruly children running the world is carried through the movie; as one character says: "They're all kids in Washington. It's like Bugsy Malone with real guns." In shades of the Chaser-APEC scandal, meanwhile, the director reveals that he was able to enter the US State Department simply by flashing his BBC pass. "I expected to be escorted in but I was just left to wander around. So I took photographs, because we wanted [the sets] to look right. And because this was brought up when the film came out in America they've now undertaken a major review of their security procedures. Hillary Clinton is safe as a result of this film."

      <review><![CDATA[A minute after Viggo Mortensen and I end our call, the phone rings. It's the publicist. "The word he was looking for was incubator,"
she says, adding - I presume at Mortensen's request - that the footage he
was talking about while searching for that word was available online.We
had been discussing the run-up to the Persian Gulf War - specifically, a
story told by a Kuwaiti nurse to Congress that helped tilt public
opinion in favor of invasion - and Mortensen couldn't think of the word
for the units in which premature babies are held. He had the publicist
call back because he wanted me to know.Mortensen is nothing if
not precise. A conversation with him tends to lead wherever he wants it
to go. Try to ask a follow-up question or change the subject, and he'll
gently, politely raise his voice and continue talking over you.In
this case, we had touched on this subject because we were discussing a
poem he had written, 'Letter from Nebraska,' which has a
post-apocalyptic theme and was inspired by the Gulf War. I'd asked
whether, between that and his performance as the father in the
long-awaited film version of Cormac McCarthy's The Road (opening on 28 Jan), he had a career interest in dystopian material."It's
funny you should say that," he says. "I'm doing a new book that's all
poems in Spanish. And then I decided to take some poems that I had
written in English and translate them into Spanish... when I came across
that [one], having shot The Road and seeing where the world continues to be going in some ways, it seemed pretty current in a way that was interesting."Mortensen
may be unique among movie stars in publishing books of his own poetry,
let alone in Spanish. (The American-born actor spent part of his
childhood in Argentina.) On the website for his publishing company,
Perceval Press, he shares poems and articles he likes by authors from
around the globe. He's also a photographer, editor and painter. For
Mortensen, it's all of a piece with acting: these are just different
ways of expressing himself."You show up on time, you treat
people with respect, and you use them, in a positive sense, to learn
and do the best job that you can, and you hope that they'll have the
same approach as you do," he says of acting in a film. "That's no
different than, for me, editing books, which I do, and trying to help
someone come up with the best representation of what they want to say...
I'm trying to do it as honestly as I can and get the most out of that
moment. 'Cos you think, yeah, I kind of did a half-assed job, but
I'll get to do it again later. And you kind of don't."It's
appropriate that he should raise the topic of getting only one
chance. McCarthy's bleak, uncompromising vision always seemed like a
risky film project. The story follows a father and his young son as
they trudge across a bombed-out America overrun by looters and
murderers; the movie asks whether it's possible to retain one's
humanity in a world where survival is all that matters. When the release of The Road was delayed a year, websites erupted in protest. Was it possible that Aussie director John Hillcoat (The Proposition) had botched an adaptation of one of the most acclaimed books of recent years? The Road finally premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August before moving
on to Toronto. Reviews have completely diverged, ranging from the
rapturous to the dismissive. ("The road leads nowhere" was how Variety began its pan.)Mortensen says apart from the Variety review, most of the reaction he's heard has been overwhelmingly
positive. He also sees the movie as faithful to the spirit of
McCarthy's book, despite charges of sentimentalising. "Let's take
another book that was very popular," Mortensen says. "And it was
adapted. Yes, it was much more of a sprawling enterprise and a bigger
challenge logistically, but Lord of the Rings captured the spirit of Tolkien.... I felt that [the adaptation of The Road]
hewed much closer in some ways. ...And it somehow avoided
feeling... slavishly respectful of the source material. I felt like this
was its own thing using all of the benefits of the medium."Mortensen
is a medium-specific kind of guy. In a sense, you'd think his work as a
painter and photographer would give him a special respect for the
pictorial aspect of filmmaking. Some directors will encourage actors to
go wherever their whims take them; others, Hitchcock perhaps most
famously, are more concerned with capturing a specific look than with
"motivation" or "spontaneity.""I've worked with those type of
directors," Mortensen says, not naming names. "I try to be sympathetic
toward them, but it's not a very effective way to do things. It shows a
lack of courage and imagination, in my opinion. Even if Hitchcock is
very smart, he would have made better movies if he would've allowed his
actors a little more freedom. Who knows? They wouldn't be the movies
that they are."There's a qualifier again. Mortensen takes what
he says seriously. He thinks acting is not only an important business,
but also a political one, regardless of a film's subject matter. "By
making a character as human as you can, you're already doing something
political," he says.That explains his penchant for bringing up politics in interviews. Even so, he sees a political element in The Road's story - at least now, in light of the American healthcare debate."You
take everything away-what are we paying taxes for?" Mortensen asks.
"What's the most important thing for a person, for a family, for a
town, for a country? ...In the sense that Maurice Sendak said, ‘There
must be more to life than having everything.' ...And I do think that this
movie, in some very indirect way, it does touch on that. When you strip
everything away, you see what really matters: life itself."That goes back to the idea of not getting second chances."I
agreed with that piece of narration where I say - this is right out of
the book; every word is McCarthy's - essentially what I say is, I
wouldn't trade this life for any other," Mortensen says. "Not that I
can. But anything that makes you appreciate the time you have on this
earth, that makes you feel like reaching out and asking yourself
questions - reaching in and reaching out after you see it - something's
working. And that's no different for a poetry reading to ten people
than it is to working on a character. And it can be Aragorn where it's
this giant crew and seven units shooting, or it can be a very small
crew in the woods in Pennsylvania shooting a scene by a stream with a
boy from Australia [Kodi Smit-McPhee]. Everything falls away when you're in the right
place as an artist." Ben Kenigsberg]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[New Zealand-born director Martin Campbell has a good track record when it comes to tricky comebacks. In 1995 he was handed the reins of GoldenEye, Pierce Brosnan's successful debut as James Bond. A decade later he ushered in Daniel Craig's 007 with Casino Royale and delivered not only a massive hit, but one of the very best Bond movies ever.  

His latest assignment also returns a popular action hero to the big screen, albeit one whose continuing popularity is less of a foregone conclusion. Mel Gibson hasn't starred in a movie since 2002's Signs. He's been busy directing his own: The Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto. While Mel's well-publicised anti-Semitic comments to the officer who arrested him for drunk driving in 2006 did not prevent Apocalypto from being a hit, it remains to be seen whether audiences are ready to accept him as a leading man again.  

Does Campbell consider his star to be damaged goods at all? "People do say that," the director says on the phone from the New Orleans set of his next film, Green Lantern. "My argument is that Mel, short of jumping off a cliff, I don't know how he could apologise more. We've all been drunk and we've all said things we don't mean. It makes me very angry the way he's been treated. I don't think he's had a drop of drink from that day to this."

Edge of Darkness offers Gibson the kind of sympathetic role that has been his stock-in-trade since Mad Max in 1978: that of a reasonable man pushed to the edge and out for revenge. Thomas Craven is a Boston police detective whose 24-year-old daughter Emma (Bojana Novakovic) is gunned down outside his home. Craven suspects she's the unwitting victim of a revenge attack by one of the crims he's collared in the past. But his investigations lead to the commercial nuclear facility where Emma was interning just prior to her murder. The ante is upped when a shadowy UK operative, Jedburgh (Ray Winstone), contacts Craven and further witnesses start being knocked off.

Scripted by William Monahan (The Departed) and Australia's Andrew Bovell (Lantana), the film is a remake of the 1985 BBC series that Campbell himself directed to great acclaim. "We've been quietly developing it as a film since 2000 and then Mel became available, so we did it," the director says. 

Widely thought of as one of the best TV shows ever produced, the original Edge of Darkness used the thriller genre to attack the nuclear policies of Margaret Thatcher, who strengthened Britain's nuclear arsenal and permitted American nuclear missiles to be stationed on British soil. "There are things that go on with the American government with the black ops that are tied up to private corporations either developing or manufacturing weapons," says Campbell. "So the movie takes the same story point as the series does, but it takes a different path."

If Campbell had any concerns that his leading man would be a little rusty, they were allayed from day one of shooting. "He just stepped up as though he'd never given up acting at all. He's very directable, Mel, I have to say." Not bossy? "He actually said to me ‘I'm not a director, I'm not a producer, I'm just the actor.'" 

Gibson, Campbell says, brings the right sense of weight to a character burdened with grief and guilt. "Bill Holden, Burt Lancaster, Lee Marvin, all these great actors who had such weight - they just don't exist anymore. Mel is one of the few who has that sort of gravitas and honesty." Campbell also applauds the ‘edginess' of upcoming Sydney performer Novokovic, who can thank Gibson for her big break. "The point is, we didn't have a lot of money for casting. Once you pay for Mel Gibson, there's not a lot left! So what you look for are fine actors who will do it for the budget you have. And Bojana did it perfectly."

Campbell, an energetic 70, also has the two Mask of Zorro films to his credit, but says that he fell into the action genre by accident. "I just like entertaining movies - I don't think I'd be any good at Chekhov." Is he a man of action himself? "Absolutely not! I'm always so busy prepping or filming. Well, I did do [mountain climbing thriller] Vertical Limit in 2000, where we went to the alps in New Zealand. And it was a bloody nightmare actually." Nick Dent]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In the world of Daybreakers, vampirism has infected humanity and, after a brief period of civil war, society has resumed its normal course, with a couple of key differences. This is a night-time culture, and the streets lie empty in daylight. The few humans that remain are farmed for blood by corporations like Bromley Marks, headed up by Charles Bromley (Sam Neill) and for whom Edward (Ethan Hawke) works as a research haematologist. Vampire scientists are searching desperately for a substitute for human blood, as supplies are dwindling and without it vampires revert to a violent, brainless, batlike form.The basics of animal husbandry seem to have eluded these demons: why not simply breed the humans? Unlike vampire stories from Dracula to New Moon, where bloodsucking is a stand-in for sex, fornication doesn't enter into the equation here. That's because in Daybreakers the red stuff doesn't symbolise lust per se, but rather humanity's insatiable lust for oil. That's right: it's a B-movie with a message - Who Killed the Electric Car? in plastic teeth and a cape. All it lacks is an undead Michael Moore sinking his fangs into big oil. Edward is a vampire with a conscience who dislikes drinking human blood; in the real world, he'd drive a Prius and keep a compost heap. After meeting a fugitive human in a traffic accident (Claudia Karvan), Ed's introduced to a secret most vampires don't know: that their condition has a cure. That cure involves a grizzled ex-vampire called Elvis (Willem Dafoe), who serves the kind of purpose a Vietnam veteran would play in a straight action film, and therefore gets the kind of cheesy dialogue reserved for Men Who've Seen Things You People Wouldn't Believe. ("Living as a human in a world of vampires," he tells Hawke, "is as dangerous as barebacking with a $5 whore." Clunk.)The Spierig Brothers are the scrappy Brisbane twins who made the 2003 zombie thriller Undead literally in their bedroom, creating the CGI effects on home computers that would take all night to process a single frame. Made in Queensland but set in America, their follow-up is a fun little B-movie with a few nice shocks and enough gore and mayhem to guarantee it a long video-store shelf life. Whether it can pass muster in cinemas remains to be seen. The special effects look cheap; and while the premise, with its "we're drinking the blood of the earth!" subtext is interesting, the characters just aren't.
That said, I for one am happy to see that Daybreakers is partly funded by the former Film Finance Corporation. It's nice to think the funding bodies are paying attention to the kind of movies large numbers of people are actually going to see. Nick Dent]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[So much of the insistently honorable Invictus is spelled out for slowpokes that when it finally hatches a subtle moment, you cheer. Already, we’ve seen black children kicking a ball on their own field while, directly across the street, white athletes scowl. (Boo!) Apartheid is over, but the movie’s Nelson Mandela (Freeman, stiffer than usual, out of respect) is prone to telling his assembled biracial staff that “reconciliation starts here.” It gets didactic, until the camera captures the beautifully mystified expression of Matt Damon, playing Afrikaner rugby captain Francois Pienaar. Sitting in his car after meeting with the president, Pienaar is speechless: an apolitical man suddenly pressed into a mighty cause. Let us now praise Damon - he may be the actor Clint Eastwood’s been looking for all these years.Invictus then becomes a tale - a real-life one - of rebranding. Mandela’s inspired vision was to shape the national Springboks club, a green-shirted symbol of the old racism, into figures of a new countrywide pride. That the team went all the way in 1995’s World Cup lends the partnership an almost mythic dimension; Eastwood, as a director of race-related material (White Hunter Black Heart), is too smart to suggest that hatred was suddenly erased. Rather, he leans into the satisfactions of a meat-and-potatoes sports film: lots of slo-mo ball spiralings and cutaways to joyous crowds hoisting lagers. Occasionally, there’s an awkward hug. It shouldn’t go unmentioned that Eastwood, 79, with the inhuman stamina of a Kurosawa, has shot a massive political epic on location within the studio system. The movie isn’t adventurous, but I’m sure glad it exists.  Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[Precious]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[If there was a gold statuette for wall-to-wall compassion, Precious would wipe the floor with its rivals this awards season. Director Lee Daniels and writer Geoffrey Fletcher’s adaptation of Sapphire’s novel Push oozes empathy from the first scene to the last. It’s inescapably bleak, but occasionally it has the confidence and spirit to emerge from the shadows of its tragic story – the tale of Precious (Gabourey Sidibe), an obese 16-year-old teenager in 1980's Harlem who is abused by her mother and father – to indulge in sly humour and jolly camaraderie before retreating again into the darkness at its heart.
‘My name’s Clarissa Precious Jones… and I want to be on the cover of a magazine,’ says Sidibe. What she gets is less glitzy: we learn of the gross difference between the refuge of her mind and the reality of her life. When her vile mother (Mo’Nique, grotesque, chilling but in the end almost sympathetic) screams, ‘I should have aborted your motherfuckin’ ass,’ Precious imagines herself walking the red carpet at a film premiere. Perhaps most movingly, when she looks in the mirror, she sees a girl who is more beautiful and more white.
So, a better life is possible, but imagination just isn’t enough: Precious is a film about real escape, not dreams. The film celebrates a winning combination of individual strength, education and community over the warped logic of the sort of corrupt household where a loveless grandma puts on a wig and feigns love for a Down’s syndrome child, a piece of theatre to secure a cheque from a visiting social worker. It’s a film that acknowledges poverty and inequality while refusing to believe that people can’t escape from their grip. It’s a truly American movie. Its realism is social – not socialist – and its happy flights of imagination recall the magical side of Danny Boyle more than the grit of Ken Loach.
Slowly, surely, Precious attends a special school with an inspirational teacher (Paula Patton), begins sessions with a social worker (Mariah Carey, unobtrusive) and fights her silent, violent and self-loathing tendencies to make new friends, a colourful bunch of girls in her class, from a mouthy Jamaican immigrant to a tough nut from The Bronx. It’s not an easy battle and Daniels has a tendency to land new blows when you think the fight is over. So oppressive and extreme is Precious’s background that you imagine terrible things are about to happen even when they’re not. I didn’t find the film as actively upsetting as many have reported – merely very, very sad.
So, should you believe the hype? Yes and no. Precious is very affecting and has some great performances, especially from Sidibe and Mo’Nique, but the film is arguably more heart than art. Is that such a bad thing? Perhaps not: when a film shines a light on a desperate way of life and gives dignity to characters barely ever portrayed on screen, you can forgive some clumsy, emphatic storytelling and a narrative that’s too episodic and reliant on voiceover. It’s a film full of life and love, well-meaning and important phenomenon that says act – don’t dwell – on your dreams. Dave Calhoun]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[The Hurt Locker]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[Pop quiz: in the 81 years of the Academy Awards, how many women have been nominated for the best director Oscar? Answer: three; namely Lena Wertmüller (Seven Beauties, 1975), Jane Campion (The Piano, 1993) and Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation, 2003). On 3 February Kathryn Bigelow will certainly make that four, and she's the odds-on favourite to actually take home a golden phallic symbol come March. And deservedly so: The Hurt Locker, which has swept critics awards across the US, articulates the Iraq War in a way that's never
been this thrilling.
"It's extraordinary to look at a day in the
life of a Baghdad bomb tech," says Bigelow, 57,
chipper on the phone from LA. "There's no margin for error: no ‘I almost cut the right wire,'" she continues. "These individuals arguably have
the most dangerous job in the world, and they volunteered for it."Bigelow's incendiary yet contemplative action drama is her first feature since 2002's Harrison Ford nuke-sub thriller, K-19: The Widowmaker.
Prior to that, she made a string of odd genre movies: an
unusually affecting vampire film, Near Dark (1987); the surfer-narc mano a mano, Point Break (1991); the Ralph Fiennes millennial thriller, Strange Days (1995). Her work over the past six years has been less visible, mostly television and shorts."That's
the cost of wanting to make something with total creative control,"
Bigelow says, with time-tested serenity. "Filmmaking is not for the
faint of heart." The Hurt Locker, produced via indie fund-raiser Nicolas Chartier (Crash),
afforded Bigelow final cut and the ability to cast two excellent
non-A-listers, Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie, in key roles as a
daredevil defuser and a by-the-book sergeant. "For me, it
always starts with the character," Bigelow offers, uneasy with being
pegged as a genre specialist. "I need to work from the inside out.
Seriously, what would incite you or I to wake up one day and think,
Hmm, bomb defusing is a vocation I'd like to pursue? And what's the
price of that heroism? They call it the lonely walk – the walk in the
heavy suit toward the suspicious object. You're by yourself. The war
has stopped for you. It's probably a very existential moment."Bigelow
met with soldiers in Kuwait and elsewhere to understand that moment,
also leaning heavily on journalist Mark Boal's screenplay, the product
of a 2004 embedding with an army bomb squad. Rooted in its characters'
stoic sense of professionalism and shot in and around Amman, Jordan, The Hurt Locker is refreshingly free of politics – indeed, the filmmaker considers it the
first Iraq War movie that's actually about the ground situation itself.
"I do consider myself a political person," she says, "but we've lost
sight of the troops that are fighting over there. There's now a
perception among them that this is a job – a good one, even – and not the Vietnam-era draft mentality of old."She has a sensibility that recalls Howard Hawks films
like Only Angels Have Wings and Rio Bravo, which
focus on characters quietly working through jeopardy with a minimum of
fuss. "Courage is not the absence of fear," Bigelow continues, "but
maintaining a sense of humour in the face of fear." That's as far as she
wants to explain it; we move on to the logistics of a summer shoot in
the Middle East and the immersion of her actors in four-camera
disarmament sequences, take after take. (Bigelow, once married to James
Cameron, can talk shop with the best of them.)
Inevitably, the
question does arise; the one that's tailed Bigelow throughout her
career making pictures associated with men's tastes. Actor Renner, by
phone, is direct in his defence: "I always get a little tense when
people bring it up. Just because she has long, shaved legs means she
can't direct a great movie?""I've been fortunate and tenacious," Bigelow admits on
the gender issue, but can't claim to have encountered any significant
resistance. "It would be impossible for me to not be who I am, and do
what I do." She laughs, well practiced at this pause. "I simply don't
bifurcate the job description." Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[George Miller's full-throttle revenge classic launched Mel Gibson's career and ran for years on the drive-in circuit.Thirty-one years later, the highway mayhem of Mad Max is still jaw-dropping and its primal violence still shocking. On Wed 25 Feb, cast and crew will reunite live on stage at the Randwick Ritz Cinema for a Popcorn Taxi screening followed by a no-holds-barred Q&amp;A.Actors Steve Bisley (‘Goose'), Hugh Keays-Byrne (‘Toecutter'), Roger Ward (‘Fifi'), Tim Burns (‘Johnny the Boy'), and Paul Johnstone (‘Cundalini') will join legendary stuntman Grant Page and more special guests yet to be announced.Mad Max is set in a dystopian near-future society suffering from a prolonged fuel shortage. Civil order is rapidly deteriorating and lawless gangs rampage across the desolate landscape, in defiance of the crumbling police force, the Main Force Patrol (MFP).An escaped cop killer, the Nightrider, is killed during a high-speed pursuit by a young MFP patrolman, Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson). The Nightrider's comrades, a motorcycle gang led by the Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne), hold Max and his partner 'the Goose' (Steve Bisley) responsible.A chain of events will force Max to throw away his moral and civil responsibilities and with the help of a super-charged V8 XB Falcon coupe... it's war.For 30 years, this movie held a record in the Guinness Book of Records as the highest profit-to-cost ratio of a motion picture ever, conceding only in 2009 to Paranormal Activity.Popcorn Taxi is proud to bring this Australian classic to the big screen for one night only to launch the Australian Film Festival - and give old and new audiences a once in a lifetime chance to experience one of the most influential films of all time, and then talk directly to the filmmakers and actors responsible.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Because watching a movie is already a kind of divine madness - a collective dream - directors need to approach the portrayal of nightmares, hallucinations and drug trips with circumspection. Dreams devalue the cinema experience by artificially inflating the odds. Even a novel that's as gripping and well written as Dennis Lehane's gothic thriller Shutter Island can falter on the screen, since viewers need to feel like they can trust what they're seeing. With typical panache, Martin Scorsese (and screenwriter Laeta Kalogradis) goes marching in where angels fear to tread in his adaptation. Scorsese's muse, Leonardo DiCaprio, as US Marshall Teddy Daniels, arrives out of the mist with his colleague Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) onto a remote, windswept island in Boston Harbour that houses Ashecliffe - a high-security asylum for the criminally insane. Daniels is here to investigate the disappearance of a patient, a multiple murderess who has "excaped" from an apparently locked room. It's 1954, and conspiracy is in the air. If Ashecliffe's dapper chief psychiatrist, Dr Cawley (Ben Kingsley), isn't hiding something from Daniels, then Dr Naehring (Max von Sydow), a German émigré, certainly is. And there's a hurricane closing in that will cut them all off from the mainland, bringing with it the risk that the lunatics could take over the asylum.Daniels has a beef against the mentally ill: his wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) has died in a fire lit by a crazed arsonist. And it's his dreams of Dolores, mixed up with horrific memories of having liberated the concentration camp of Dachau, that invade the narrative and may stretch the viewer's faith in where the story is going. These lengthy fantasy sequences are visually impressive, but wearying.The cast is first-rate, with Jackie Earl Haley, Emily Mortimer and Patricia Clarkson also appearing. Scorsese directs with fluid grace, drawing freely from the Hitchcock school of suspense, where violent storms, dark corridors and vertiginous staircases reflect and amplify the protagonist's mind-set. This is the relatively entertaining late-period Scorsese of The Departed rather than the overwrought and ponderous late-period Scorsese of Gangs of New York and The Aviator. It's just a shame that what begins as an intriguing mystery in a forebidding location gets lost in a labyrinth of paranoia and psychobabble. When the solution to the mystery is revealed, it's meant to rattle us to the core; but it's actually something of a misfire. Nick Dent]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Movies about country musicians tend to go one of two ways. First, there are those inspired by true events, films like Coal Miner’s Daughter or Walk the Line, which explore the rise of a legend: all one-room shacks, abusive parents and acres of gingham. Then there are stories inspired by the songs themselves: tales of hardship and loss, redemption and self-discovery, saloon bars, acoustic guitars and gallons of sippin’ whisky.

Crazy Heart falls squarely into the latter bunch. Jeff Bridges plays Bad Blake, a one-time Nashville big hitter reduced to touring Midwestern dives picking up loose change and loose women, his livelihood in even worse shape than his liver. That is, until two events conspire to turn his sinking ship around: a relationship with Maggie Gyllenhaal's Jean promises the kind of unflinching affection and familial grounding Blake badly needs, and a gig writing songs for one-time protégé-turned-megastar Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) provides a much-needed jolt for his career.

In purely story terms this is by-the-numbers stuff, ticking all the expected boxes about redemption and renewal. But writer-director Scott Cooper's trick is to turn that predictability into a strength: like a song you’ve heard a thousand times but which never fails to tug the heartstrings, Crazy Heart feels familiar, even comforting, offering few surprises but a wealth of lovingly crafted, immaculately judged, wholly authentic emotion.

The emotion is there in the soundtrack put together by Cooper and producing legend T-Bone Burnett, with new songs by Burnett and Ryan Bingham sitting perfectly alongside obvious inspirations like Townes van Zandt and Waylon Jennings. It’s also in Cooper’s solid direction: despite his inexperience, he never falls prey to flashy first-time director syndrome, confident that his screenplay and cast will carry him through.

And it’s in those remarkable central performances: Bridges has already earned an Oscar nomination, but it’s impossible to overstate how much his honest, unabashed performance – part The Dude, part Kris Kristofferson – grounds the film. He’s backed by a sympathetic Gyllenhaal, making magic from a potentially thankless role, and a convincing turn from Farrell as the preening bigshot in cowboy clothes. But best of all is Robert Duvall, who essentially defined the subgenre with ‘Tender Mercies’ back in 1983, and whose quiet, deeply felt turn as a bar owner reminds us of his undimmed but underused talent.

A shame, then, that the movie falls at the final hurdle with a series of crude, convenient feelgood twists, leading to an abrupt, unconvincing finale. If Cooper and his cast hadn’t done their work so well, hadn’t made us care so deeply for these fractured souls, maybe it wouldn’t matter. As it is, Crazy Heart is only two-thirds a great movie: but like the song says, that ain’t bad. Tom Huddleston]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Lisbeth Salander - the Swedish cybergoth - is one of the more intriguing characters of recent airport fiction. A tough 24-year-old computer genius with a photographic memory and a body covered in tatts and piercings, she's the main drawcard in the late Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy of technological thrillers that has sold more than 21 million copies in various translations. As portrayed by the inscrutable Noomi Rapace, Salander is also the best reason to keep watching the film adaptation of the first novel, in which she meets her mentor/offsider, crusading investigative journalist Mikael Blomqvist (As It Is in Heaven's Michael Nyqvist).The film and book's original Swedish title is Men Who Hate Women, and there are certainly a few of those to go around, starting with Lisbeth's  sadistic legal guardian Bjurman (Peter Andersson). She's under psychiatric observation by the state for a crime she has committed as a minor, and the depraved Bjurman wants to keep her in a state of sexual servitude. (A glance at her charge sheet - or her stony, don't-fuck-with-me face - might have persuaded him against the wisdom of that.) One nasty revenge scene later, Salander is free to go back to what she does best: hacking into people's computers, namely Blomqvist's.Meanwhile Blomqvist, in classic noir style, has been summoned to the mansion of octogenarian billionaire Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube, a dead ringer for the older Jimmy Stewart). Vanger is still mourning the disappearance of his teenage niece, Harriet, 40 years earlier, and hires Blomqvist to sift through dusty boxes of evidence in a cottage on his estate. The main clue is a list of women's names and phone numbers scrawled on the front page of Harriet's diary that the police never managed to explain. When snooping Salander sends Blomqvist an email explaining their meaning, the craggy journo and the bisexual tearaway form an odd couple to solve the mystery.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was made for Swedish TV, and it sadly shows, with a ponderous small screen pacing seemingly timed for commercial breaks. Despite the use of computers to zoom in on old photographs, it's more Midsomer Murders than big-screen techno-mystery, and it doesn't take a degree in computer science to figure out that the fruit rots close to the Vanger family tree. An American version is in the works, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo may be that rare thing - a European film that might actually be improved by a Hollywood remake. Go ahead, Tinseltown - do your worst. Nick Dent]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[A Single Man]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[A Single Man is suffused with two kinds of nostalgia: longing for a lost loved one, and an acute pining for the 1960s. The film is an adaptation Christopher Isherwood's 1964 novel about a Los Angeles English professor, George Falconer, dealing with the car-crash death of his partner of 16 years. Fashion designer Ford, making his directorial debut, could have equally taken his cues from 1960s-set TV drama Mad Men.Shooting in a soft, grainy glow that resembles Kodachrome, Ford lingers lovingly on black-rimmed spectacles, beehive hairdos, Cadillacs, lamps and modernist buildings. It's a production designer's dream, coated in the era's most melancholy shades of brown, and art directors Dan Bishop and Ariane Phillips pull out all the stops. Luckily, Ford's delight in Kennedy-era design dovetails nicely with his lead character's mindset. George (Colin Firth) wakes up on Friday, 30 November, 1962, with the intention of ending his life. As he moves from his job, to the bank and to the house of his best friend, Charley (the excellent Julianne Moore), he looks upon objects and faces with the knowledge he will never see them again. (Even the smell of a passing dog enchants him, "like buttered toast".) George's wistful mood is too heavy to be penetrated by the sexual eagerness of either a handsome student, Kenny (Nicholas Hoult), or a handsomer Spanish rent boy (Jon Kortajarena) he encounters in a parking lot. Colin Firth has been nominated for an Oscar for this role and it's easy to see why. In flashback we see George being informed of Jim's (Matthew Goode) death by phone. He holds his stiff upper lip while being told he can't come to the funeral as it's for family only, then see him paralysed in his chair with shock, tears welling up. Ford favours close-ups for his performers as well as his props, and Firth's devastation is awful to behold. The film's politics are understated but pointed. George learns from a neighbour's young daughter that her father disapproves of him for being "light in his loafers". He also snaps at his one-time lover Charley's suggestion that his 16-year relationship with Jim was just a passing phase. "If you weren't such a goddam poof we would all have been happy," is the gin-soaked divorcée's half-serious rejoinder. George and Charley are both expatriate Londoners, both lonely, and both trapped, but their friendship is a beautiful thing. Lush music by Abel Korzeniowski and Shigeru Umebayashi (In the Mood for Love) completes A Single Man's mood of trembling poignancy. One might expect a fashion icon's debut film would be flashy and superficial, but Ford's movie is a layered work of quality tailoring. Nick Dent]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[There's little doubt that Memphis interior designer Leigh Anne Touhy and her family did a noble thing when they adopted Michael Oher, a hulking, homeless 17 year old, helped him get his grades up, and set him down the path towards a career as a pro footballer. They, and he, deserve a much better movie than the sanctimonious, self-satisfied pap that is The Blind Side, a film that Ned Flanders might find two-dimensional and preachy. The story is based on a chapter from a non-fiction book by Michael Lewis about the recruitment process for American football. Oher (Quinton Aaron), the barely literate child of a crackhead mother, is admitted to an exclusive Christian school in an act of charity, tempered with the football coach's hope he will make a formidable addition to their school team. When football-loving parent Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) realises that despite his scholarship this gentle giant has to sleep in the school gymnasium, she takes him into her palatial home with the support of her husband, fast food millionaire Sean (Tim McGraw). It's especially generous of them considering the family woes: nine-year-old son, SJ (Jae Head), is suffering from a terminal case of Movie Kid. All freckles, gapped teeth and catchphrases, SJ is like a scamp from a 1960s sitcom - cloying, artificial, insufferable. It's a car crash of a performance, and director John Lee Hancock's camera just can't seem to look away. SJ and Michael bond over videogames, while the Tuohys' teenage daughter Collins (Lily, er, Collins) reacts to the sudden arrival of a new, taciturn, big, big brother with unteenager-like forbearance. Michael can't play for the school team until he starts getting better grades, and the school's teachers rally round with righteous goodwill to help the poor black kid grapple with English, science and history. Once admitted onto the field, he proves to have the perfect girth to play offensive tackle - one of the most valuable assets to an American NFL team - and it's not long before college recruiters start calling.All very inspirational stuff, to be sure, but it's more than two hours into the film before Big Mike pointedly says: "Nobody's asking me what I want." The Blind Side has been a huge hit with bible belt audiences, thrilled by the Tuohys' colourblind charity and goodness, but African-American pundits have been outraged at the way the passive Michael is pushed and prodded by his wealthy, white minders - like one of the ketchup bottles that SJ shunts around the dining table to demonstrate football moves. They're right: it's incredibly condescending.Sandra Bullock's Oscar nomination for this is disturbing, rather like Sarah Palin's nomination for Vice President. She steamrollers through the movie, utterly convinced of the rightness of her actions and shouting down her opposition. The film seems constructed so as to keep the spotlight on Bullock: everyone else is either a cardboard cutout of saintly goodness (hooray!), a risible cliché of intolerance (boo!) or a clammed-up cipher (Michael). It's too bad the filmmakers did not see the ironies in this story and approach it with some subtlety. This tale of selflessness and loving one's fellow man would have made a great movie about selflessness and loving one's fellow man. Nick Dent]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Although far better than its troubled history lead one to fear, this gory, gothic take on the classic lycanthropic love story has had its romantic heart ripped out. Returning to his estranged father's crumbling pile in 1891 - to investigate his brother's disappearance - actor Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) falls for his dead sibling's mourning fiancée, Gwen (Emily Blunt). But before this spark of love can ignite, Lawrence is bitten by the lunar-tic creature the locals fear, and must confront the beast buried within himself. With its mist-shrouded sets, gruesome slaughter and copious CGI, this is a surprisingly respectful updating of the 1941 Universal original. Thanks to Rick Baker's make-up effects, Del Toro's transformations from handsome lover to hairy, howling beast are frighteningly convincing; Anthony Hopkins is restrained as his emotionally detached father; and a cruelly underused Blunt is all-a-quiver as the beautiful, bereaved Gwen. Ultimately, though, neither Joe Johnston's efficient direction nor Danny Elfman's hard-working score can lift the familiar storyline out of the ordinary. Nigel Floyd]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The Wonderland (or ‘Underland') of Lewis Carroll was a whimsical, mid-Victorian philosophical landscape where the laws of logic held no sway. In Tim Burton's film, however, it's your run-of-the-mill totalitarian state where the evils of dictatorship are all too banal and familiar. It's where an 18-year-old Alice (Mia Wasikowska) ends up while fleeing the proposals of her stuffed-shirt suitor Lord Hamish (Leo Bill), unaware that she has visited this topsy-turvy world before as a child. A cross between Pandora, Narnia and a graveyard, Underland is where a coterie of creatures from Carroll's books are ready to welcome Alice as the valiant heroine foretold to help the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) and the good White Queen (Anne Hathaway) defeat the evil, balloon-headed Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), and restore balance to the Force. Or something like that.  When a book poses difficulties in adaptation – and they don't come much more befuddling than the Alice books – you can do one of two things: break bravely from narrative tradition to be faithful to the source material (see Where the Wild Things Are), or just go ahead and tell a completely different story. Burton and screenwriter Linda Woolverton have mainly opted for the latter course. Their pretext is the short ‘Jabberwocky' nonsense poem that Alice finds in Through the Looking Glass, involving a young hero who slays a monster. Eventually, resplendent in Joan-of-Arc get-up, Alice will get the typical rousing speech from an ethereal Anne Hathaway (presumably Cate Blanchett wasn't available) informing her that only she can slay the Jabberwock with the Vorpal Blade. Depp, meanwhile, plays the Hatter as a vengeful Scot, addled by regret, who rises to the call of battle ready to fling hatpins and rolls of fabric at the Red Queen's playing-card soldiers - saving the world with haberdashery.  It's a shame Burton gets his Lewis Carroll mixed up with his Tolkien and CS Lewis. Still, the film's 3D visuals are fun to look at, and there's a wizard's school worth of great British actors contributing voice work and occasionally even their faces. (Little Britain's Matt Lucas is amusing as Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Dee.) With her upper lip painted to recall Hitler's moustache, Bonham Carter marches around, petulantly demanding decapitations, while Crispin Glover gets to be surprisingly dashing as her henchman, the Knave of Hearts. As for Aussie newcomer Wasikowska, she does a perfectly capable job of insisting that everything is merely a dream and that she's in control, while an army of special effects technicians shrinks, expands, and tosses her from pillar to post. After this and Avatar, let's hope Australia's latest batch of stars don't need to be propped up by computer animation to make an impact. Nick Dent
10 odd facts... Alice in Wonderland
1. Contrary to popular belief, the 1865 novel's title isn't Alice in Wonderland. It's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.
2. Lewis Carroll (real name Charles Dodgson) was a mathematician at Christ Church College, Oxford. All of the famous scenes in the story - such as the Mad Hatter's Tea Party - were Carroll's swipes at the new imaginary number theory (algebra), which he thought was absurd.
3. Although Tweedledum, Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty and the Jabberwock are often thought to be characters in the book, they only appear in the sequel, Through the Looking-Glass.
4. Carroll caricatures himself in the book as the Dodo. Carroll/Dodgson was known to have stuttered, so if he spoke his last name it would be Do-Do-Dodgson.
5. Alice is said to be strongly based on Carroll's child friend Alice Peasance Liddell. During the Mad Hatter's Tea party, Alice reveals that the date is 4 May, which happens to be the real-life birthday of Alice Liddell.
6. Biographers suggest that Carroll was romantically or sexually attached to Alice Liddell as a child. The relationship between the Liddels and Carroll suffered a sudden break in June 1863.
7. Hatmaking was the main trade in Stockport, near where Carroll grew up. The Mad Hatter derives from hat makers who suffered from mercury poisoning in the process of curing felt.
8. It's reported that Carroll found inspiration from the Cheshire Cat in the 16th century sandstone carving of a grinning cat located near his birthplace.
9. Queen Victoria enjoyed Alice's Adventures in Wonderland so much that she asked Carroll dedicate his next book to her, and was presented with a scholarly volume titled An Elementary Treatise on Determinants.
10. "Alice in Wonderland Syndrome' is a brain condition affecting the way objects are perceived by the mind. Joanna Lowry]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[The Red Shoes]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[A romantic fantasy about a doomed ballerina, the 1948 film The Red Shoes, directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, has been restored with the help of Martin Scorsese, whose own Shutter Island is currently in cinemas. The Red Shoes will be re-released at the Chauvel Cinema, Paddington, this month. Here's what Scorsese had to say about the film to Time Out.His first impressions of The Red ShoesWhen
did it catch on here in New York? 1950? So I must have been eight or
nine. I remember abstract impressions of colour and movement. Later, it
became a very intense psychological vortex of passion, like a whirlpool
sucking in the lives and souls of these characters. I was intrigued by
the obsession, the need to dance. To be an artist. I guess it all comes
down to that wonderful exchange early in the film when Anton Walbrook
confronts Moira Shearer at a cocktail party. "Why do you want to
dance?" he asks, and she answers, "Why do you want to live?" There's no
choice about it. The look on his face is extraordinary.How the film inspires himOver the years, if I've found myself weakening, it's not that I summon up the exact atmosphere and experience of seeing The Red Shoes,
but that determined state of mind has definitely become part of who I
am. I feel that this movie has given myself and plenty of other
filmmakers the courage to keep going. It's about directing. But it's
also about a dedication to what you do. You may not do it well
[laughs], you may do it very well. But no matter what it is, you have
to do it. And often, that's a dangerous thing, not only to you, but to
the people around you.The magic of the film's colourNo,
the colour in the movie isn't realistic. But it reflects the heightened
world of the ballet, of theatre. Colour is always something that is
going to be an aesthetic comment, no matter how you do it. When you see The Red Shoes from the centre of the tenth row, you get submerged in a kind of
reality, so to speak. You see these extraordinary close-ups of these
people's faces, with this amazing make-up on their eyes and red, red
lipstick. It's so blunt. Halfway through our screening at Cannes, the
audience spontaneously applauded. I've never seen the print looking
this good.How The Red Shoes influenced Raging BullThe
movie hasn't inspired me shot by shot. But the idea of whether your
determination is going to take you off the cliff and you perish? That's Raging Bull. It's funny: when Michael Powell saw some 8mm test footage of De Niro sparring in 1978 or '79, he said,
"You know, it's interesting, this sparring, but there's one thing
wrong." I said, "What's that?" He said, "The red boxing gloves are too
red." I said, "You're absolutely right." That was one of the reasons we
decided to make it black-and-white.Why I still champion Michael PowellPeeping Tom destroyed Michael Powell's
career, and I helped get that film re-released. There was a dismissal
of his work. A great deal of it had to do with the style of filmmaking
coming out of England in the 1960s, excellent pictures like This
Sporting Life. A new realism, yes, but the filmmakers had to eschew
what came before them - a shame. We went about reclaiming those films.
I even had an Anton Walbrook (who plays the Russian ballet master in The Red Shoes)
Cossack shirt - yes, a velvet one. I still have it [laughs]. It's a
little warm. I think it had to do with the lack of central heating in
England. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Thirty-five years after Network and All the President’s Men, in which journalists told uncomfortable truths and defended democracy, Green Zone makes military personnel do the noble work which craven reporters shirk. The only consolation is that the movie is inspired by a work of journalism, Rajiv Chandrasekaran’s Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraq’s Green Zone.Set in Iraq in the months following the 2003 invasion, the film reunites the director and star of The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon; this time, however, we already know the details of the underhanded government action our hero confronts. Damon plays an army warrant officer whose WMD sorties keep coming up empty; unwilling to roll over, he’s soon embroiled in a turf war between the CIA and the Pentagon (personified by conscientious Brendan Gleeson and oleaginous Greg Kinnear) while attempting to wrangle a Ba’athist general (Igal Naor), a useful veteran (Said Faraj) and a useless embedded reporter (Amy Ryan) against a backdrop of more-or-less real events.Greengrass’s approach to real-life disaster is far more simplified and pumped up here than it was in United 93 or Bloody Sunday, but there’s much to be said for his ‘Bourne in Baghdad’ approach. The action is robust, the politics simplified but strident, insisting that a wilfully under-prepped war worked against both US and Iraqi interests. By shifting focus from the naively doctrinaire civilians of Chandrasekaran’s book to street-level soldiers questioning authority, Greengrass concocts a formula with a fighting chance of dispelling the Curse of the Hollywood Iraq Movie. If a picture as conventionally accessible as Green Zone tanks, that campaign is surely lost. Ben Walters]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[There’s tons of brooding for your buck in the hilariously earnest Remember Me, which will hopefully be revived several years from now as a beloved midnight movie. Twilight inamorato Robert Pattinson (star and executive producer) confidently sulks his way through this jaw-dropping mix of come-hither stares, “love me, Daddy!” histrionics and historical tragedy.He’s Tyler Hawkins, a gloomily soulful NYU student at odds with his businessman father (Brosnan), and who cracks Boyz II Men jokes as if he were Allen Ginsberg reading Howl. After getting into a street fight, he’s arrested by a policeman (Cooper) who—it just so happens—has a daughter (De Ravin) also enrolled at NYU. One alpha-male bet with his roommate later, Tyler’s on a retributive date…but then love begins to bloom.Sex is had, past secrets are revealed, but all is not well in Camelot, as director Allen Coulter and writer Will Fetters shamelessly hint via snatches of summer 2001 news broadcasts (it’s a period piece, see) and a telegraphing glimpse at a certain pair of buildings. I can’t say any more beyond telling you that I came out of the screening with an ear-to-ear grin I don’t usually get from even great movies. Bless you, R.Patz &amp; Co., because this gloriously steaming pile is officially in the bad-movies-we-love pantheon. Keith Uhlich]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A Gallic American Pie without the sugary taste, The French Kissers serves up slices of male teenage life in all its awkwardness, ugliness, and sexual desperation. Hervé (Vincent Lacoste), 14, has fallen into the geek caste at his local school. Afflicted with braces and acne, tormented by the cool kids and erotic urges, he swaps lingerie catalogues with his heavy-metal freak friend Camel (Anthony Soningo) and fantasises about girls. Hervé gets no relief at home: his high-spirited mother (Noémie Lvovsky) finds it hilarious to embarrass him, teasing him about his masturbating, buying tampons in front of him, even following him into a house party to which she has driven him. Then one of the popular girls, Aurore (Alice Tremoilieres), takes a shine to Hervé. And of course, he can't quite believe it at first - the flipside of teen sex mania being the utter fear of females. Will she let him sleep with her? Will her sophisticated friends accept him? What rumours will make their way around the schoolyard? And how will Hervé stuff it up - the stuffing up of teenage first-love being a universal given? The French Kissers puts glorious lie to the assumption that the French are all born with their savoir faire perfectly in place. This is the painfully funny debut film of Riad Sattouf, who has written several graphic novels about adolescence. A massive hit in France, the film catalogues the difficulties of puberty so accurately that it makes you wonder how teenagers even get through the day, what with bullying, humiliation, moodswings and unwanted erections. (You also wonder how their poor teachers put up with them - and as the film suggests, some, tragically, can't.) Sattouf's eye for authentic and sordid details is unflinching: a curious eye that opens during a kiss; a urination malfunction; practice pashing on a mirror; the use of socks as a receptacle for semen; and the blind callousness of which 14 year olds are capable.  Sattouf deliberately sought ugly ducklings from Paris schools in his casting process and the performances by these first-time actors are all wonderfully natural. Lacoste in particular, with his unforced deadpan presence, is a real find. French cinema has a new coming-of-age classic to go alongside Au Revoir les Enfants and The 400 Blows (call it The 400 Wanks). Wondering what to go see among the rush of Boxing Day releases? This one's the pick. Nick Dent<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Brothers captures the fallout in when a soldier
(Tobey Maguire) goes missing in Afghanistan and his wife (Natalie Portman) becomes
close to his brother (Jake Gyllenhaal) back home in the US. Irish director Jim Sheridan, 60, a master of the searing kitchen-sink drama, explains to Time Out why he remade Susanne Bier's 2004 Danish film of the same name.You've just got off a flight from the US. Do you work on films when you fly? Back in the day when I was younger and I was
writing My Left Foot,
we were on the runway and taking off and if you're in any way scared it
activates something in your mind for writing. There's conflict and deep
fear in the air. It kind of puts you in that space between life and
death.Does a sense of mortal danger make it harder to concentrate? No,
I think it focuses you. I live off adrenaline. It's only when the
adrenaline's going that I'm clear up top. So maybe that's a fuckin'
childhood trauma, or something.Do you ever watch films on planes? No, very rarely. But I saw The Hangover on a plane which I loved. The structure is brilliant where they wake up and they can't remember anything... My life's occasionally a little like that.How were you first introduced to Susanne Bier's version of Brothers? I watched it in my house on tape. I thought it was rather good,
and when I heard they wanted to remake it I thought I could do
something different with it. I liked the idea of the main character
being put in a place beyond life and death, where whatever choice he
makes is going to be wrong.What appealed to you about it? Well,
the brothers having a fight appealed to me. Sibling rivalry in general
- I know a bit about that. The family story too. The ability to say
something about post-traumatic stress was interesting. You didn't write it. Did you ever want to? Of
course, but here's the thing: if you're a director, you won't get a
credit for writing in the current system. It's impossible in America.
You just won't get credit.I don't understand. Why? What
used to happen was that the producers and directors used to bend the
arms of the writers to get a credit. The Writers' Guild acted the
opposite way - they didn't want credit for directors and producers. So,
even if you go in and rewrite everything, they'll still say it wasn't
your idea. Not unless you go into an arbitration where you produce a 50-page
document on what you wrote and what you didn't write, then three
members of the Writers' Guild say yes or no. Basically, it's like a
court case. But I do feel that the
director is the main creative force in the movie making process, so it
doesn't really matter.So do you feel you're more of a writer or a director? The weird thing is, I wrote My Left Foot, The Field, In the Name of the Father, The Boxer and In America, and luckily enough, all of them got nominated for Oscars...except The Boxer,
which got some Golden Globes. Even then, people still only look at me
as a director and not a writer. And when they hear me talking, they
think I'm totally inarticulate! Writing is easier. You can slack off.
You get up when you want, get a coffee and a paper, then I'll come back
via the bookies, then before you know it, it's four o'clock in the
afternoon, you know?Where did you set Brothers? It's not obvious from watching it. The
weird thing is, I didn't set it anywhere. When people asked me where it
was set, I said "California", because I didn't want anyone to do
accents. Having a voice coach wandering around the set saying "accent,
accent, accent" drives me nuts. One of the producers of Brothers said that the fact the film involves the war in Afghanistan is not important. He said Tobey Maguire's character could have suffered in any traumatic situation. Do you agree with that? More
or less. Yet, I don't think Tobey Maguire would have been as affected if he'd been in a car crash or something.
We're in a war where there are no rules. Choosing heroic suicide or
life - it's a hard choice. Suicide bombers I'm not into. I think it's
a bit of a cop out.What research did you do for your portrayal of the Afghan militants in the film? We
just read up as much as we could about the Taliban really. And a little
bit on Al-Qaeda. But, at the end of the day, it's an imaginative thing
where you're taking an idea and just running it. I mean, are they
stereotypical Al-Qaeda guys? I dunno. David Jenkins]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Finally: a French movie for the subtitle-averse. Welcome is set in Calais, where refugees from different nations converge to find a way into England. French may be the language of diplomacy, but English is the common tongue of the desperate and dispossessed. Bilal (Firat Ayverdi), a 17-year-old Kurd, has the 500 euros he needs to pay a smuggler to get him onboard a truck and through the Channel Tunnel, but when the plan comes unstuck he has an idea so suicidal it might just work: why not swim to England? He pays local swim coach Simon Calmat (Vincent Lindon) for some lessons. Simon is a former swimming champ pushing 50 whose divorce from Marion (Audrey Dana) is just about to come through. The split is amicable, and there's still a spark of affection between the two, although Marion is disappointed Simon doesn't have more sympathy for asylum seekers.That's about to change. The reality of his lonely existence hitting home, Simon starts to admire Bilal's determination, and gives the youth a couch to sleep on for a few nights. But the burghers of Calais are suspicious of refugees, and Simon's neighbours are watching him closely. Philippe Lioret has directed an enjoyable melodrama about a hot-button issue, bringing to light the tragic difficulties asylum seekers go through. One gruesome fact we discover is that the "clandestines" on board trucks have to cover their heads with plastic bags when passing through border security because guards use CO2 detectors. Lindon is a tall, broad, masculine presence whose face simultaneously exudes world-weariness and hopefulness, while Ayverdi is a lovable mix of awkwardness and determination, like a Turkish Michael Cera. With its bitterly ironic title, Welcome is a film to prick the conscience of any who still believe there's such a thing as a "queue jumper". Nick Dent]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[Micmacs]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[If you'd never seen a Jean-Pierre Jeunet film then you might find Micmacs gloriously fresh and freewheeling. The director of Amélie has been delivering blackly comic stories of lovable misfits and their harebrained schemes for 20 years, ever since 1991's Delicatessen. Micmacs is not his best work, but it's an inventively skittish journey with a serious message about arms dealing.The movie begins in Hurt Locker territory. A bomb disposal expert in Morocco is killed by a mine. Back in Paris, his wife is driven catatonic with shock and his young son, Bazil, is packed off to a Catholic boarding school.Thirty years later, Bazil (French superstar Dany Boon) is a video store clerk who gets caught in the crossfire of a random gun battle. With a bullet lodged in his brain, Bazil is now prone to vivid hallucinations. Like a faulty cathode ray TV, he often has to whack his forehead to clear the picture. Having lost his job, Bazil swiftly falls in with a junkyard coterie of secondhand dealers (like you do). Presided over by the matriarchal Mama Chow (Yolande Moreau), they each have powers that border on disabilities.There's a human cannonball (Jeunet's favourite actor, Dominique Pinon); a girl with a brain like a calculator (Marie-Julie Baup); and a man who can communicate only in clichés and aphorisms (Omar Sy). There's also Elastic Girl (Julie Ferrier), a contortionist whose ability to hide inside boxes and fridges comes in very handy in the elaborate caper they're about to pull.Bazil discovers that the arms manufacturer who made the landmine that killed his father is located across the road from the one that made the bullet in his brain. With his new friends he sets out to revenge himself on these two ruthless tycoons (André Dussollier and Nicolas Marie) and teach them a lesson in ethics. As this is a Jeunet film, that lesson will involve improbable tricks, crazy cons and elaborate machinery. While Jeunet's Audrey Tautou films A Very Long Engagement and Amélie are both schematic and moving, Micmacs is schematic and artificial. Boon, with his hangdog looks and Buster Keatonish pratfalls, is engaging, but his zany friends never exhibit any character traits beyond zaniness. Jeunet has fashioned another cinematic perpetual motion machine, but this time the cogs are showing. Nick Dent]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[War movies are a minefield. Either the grim truth of battle gets muddied by an audience's expectations of happy endings (clear-cut heroes and villains and good triumphing over evil), or the weight of history crushes story and turns a worthy tale into a cinema bomb.The last Australian war film, 2006's Kokoda - directed by Alister Grierson, who is currently in Queensland helming $30 million 3D epic Sanctum for producer James Cameron - was typical of a film caught in the Art vs Truth crossfire, sacrificing cohesive story for co-funding (and thus meddling) from the Australian War Memorial.But Australia's latest war film, Beneath Hill 60, sidesteps expectation. "If this story wasn't true," says star Brendan Cowell, "you dead-set wouldn't believe it."He's right. Who knew a company of WWI Aussie diggers was responsible for what was then the largest man-made explosion in history, a 1917 detonation that smashed open the German frontline and led directly to the Allies' victory the next year?Not even renaissance man Cowell, 34. "The fact this beautiful, complicated, demented, heroic story was virtually untold until now tells me we've all been too caught up in our double mortgages and decorating our personal playgrounds to care about real Australian stories and dark parts of our history," the poet, playwright, director and soon-to-be-author says.Beneath Hill 60 - based on a book by Will Davies - casts Cowell as Captain Oliver Woodward - "miner turned soldier turned strategist turned killer" - and commander of the 1st Australian Tunnelling Division, a motley crew of former miners turned soldiers who fought a silent, terrifying war 30 metres under the Western Front."These were the original 'Diggers' - men dealing with the huge psychological issues of war through camaraderie, humour, humility and chivalry," says Cowell, who admits he based his characterisation of Woodward on ex-Australian cricket captain, Steve Waugh, the modern personification of ANZAC credos "courage, endurance, mateship, sacrifice".
The cast - which includes Gyton Grantley, Aden Young and Anthony Hayes - did their damnedest to live and breathe ANZAC hardship. "The boys went off on a week-long boot camp, sleeping rough, firing shotguns and drinking rum out of billycans," Cowell laughs.Director Jeremy Sims engineered a "brutal" shoot that left Cowell and co "thrashed, battered and bruised". "From Scene One, we shelved egos and vowed ‘No whinging, no complaints, no cabaret'... but it's hard to maintain the 1,000-yard stare of an ANZAC when there's a French chef and make-up truck on standby." Angus Fontaine

      <review><![CDATA[Russia, 1910. In his old age, Leo Tolstoy has become so famous worldwide that the merest hint he’s about to pop his clogs sends newsreel cameras gathering in anticipation. The real story though, as this slightly fusty drama elaborates, is unfolding inside the Tolstoy household, where the octogenerian writer (Christopher Plummer, authentically beardy) finds himself in the centre of a dispute over the valuable publishing rights to 'War and Peace'. The Tolstoyan political movement – an organisation espousing his ideas on communal property to combat social injustice – sense a major funding opportunity should Tolstoy sign his best-known book over to their leader Chertkov (Paul Giamatti), yet Tolstoy’s aristocratic wife Sofya (Helen Mirren), having delivered him 13 children, is determined to fight her corner to the bitter end.

Idealism versus family ties makes for a potentially juicy set-to, yet it’s the historical detail which keeps this adaptation of Jay Parini’s novel relatively intriguing, rather than merely stodgy. Writer-director Michael Hoffman is all reverence towards Tolstoy himself, but curiously supercilious towards the beliefs of the Tolstoyan movement, thus undermining the key subplot (eager young acolyte James McAvoy gets his dream job as the great man’s secretary, but must also spy on him) and unfairly loading the central conflict in favour of ferocious spouse Mirren. Her impressively projected performance becomes the dominating factor, causing Plummer to overdo it, and sidelining both the earnestly wet McAvoy and moustache-twirling Giamatti. Engaging performers all, but the movie’s superficial flummery is slightly exasperating when the true-life events would have provided an even richer palette of ideas. Trevor Johnston]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ronnie Miller (Cyrus) has Georgia on her mind. That’s because this teen delinquent and former piano prodigy (she played Carnegie Hall when she was seven!) has been sent there for the summer to stay with her estranged composer father (Kinnear). While her annoying younger brother helps Dad build a stained-glass window for a burned-out church, dour Ronnie fends off a ravenous raccoon, brushes up on her Tolstoy and runs afoul of the local lasses who peg her as a city slut gone country. Then volleyball-player–car-mechanic–aquarium-volunteer Will Blakelee (Hemsworth)—the washboard-abs Ken to Ronnie’s skimpy-shorts Barbie—enters the picture. They meet cute over a spilled milkshake, and it isn’t long before they’re doing underwater canoodling, staring longingly at the horizon and making eternal declarations of love.

Director Julie Anne Robinson does the best she can with what she has, coaxing competent performances from the two leads (and a particularly fine one from a world-weary Kinnear) and adding so many soothing, widescreen pillow shots that it feels like you’re swimming through a sea of down with the Snuggle bear. But this is a Nicholas Sparks joint—the master of mush coadapted his own novel—so eventually there has to be a five-car pileup of melodramatic contrivances: an unfinished song, unsolved arson, cancer, class warfare and newly birthed sea turtles as an inspirational metaphor! Maybe Douglas Sirk could have made something profound out of the pseudo-ennobling horsepucky. As is, The Last Song is what the crinkle-nosed Southern belle in all of us would resoundingly deem 'Trash! Trash! Trash!' Keith Uhlich]]></review>

Taxi Driver
New York City cab driver Travis Bickle constantly, almost obsessively, reflects on the ugly corruption of life around him, and becomes increasingly disturbed over his own loneliness and alienation. In nearly every phase of his life, Bickle remains a complete outsider, failing to make emotional contact with anyone. Unable to sleep night after night, Travis haunts the local pornography emporiums to find diversion, and begins desperately thinking about an escape from his depressing existence.]]></review>

Raging Bull
When Jake LaMotta steps into a boxing ring and obliterates his opponent, he's a prizefighter. But when he treats his family and friends the same way, he's a ticking time bomb, ready to go off at any moment. Though LaMotta wants his family's love, something always seems to come between them. Perhaps it's his violent bouts of paranoia and jealousy. This kind of rage helped make him a champ, but in real life, he winds up in the ring alone.]]></review>

Mean Streets
The future is set for Tony and Michael - owning a neighbour- hood bar and making deals in the mean streets of New York city's Little Italy. For Charlie, the future is less clearly defined. A small-time hood, he works for his uncle, making collections and reclaiming bad debts. He's probably too nice to succeed. In love with a woman his uncle disapproves of (because of her epilepsy) and a friend of her cousin, Johnny Boy, a near psychotic whose trouble-making threatens them all - he can't reconcile opposing values.]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[Kick-Ass]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[To justify taking up 100 minutes of your life a movie ought to show you at least one thing you've never seen before. On the entrance of Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), the 11-year-old, cute-as-a-button angel of death in Kick-Ass, I was ready to call it a fair exchange. This fille fatale - four foot nothing, livid purple wig, armed to the teeth - dispatches bad guys with guns, knives, grenades and salty remarks (you haven't heard a little girl curse like this since The Exorcist). Trained in violent vigilantism by her crazed ‘Big Daddy' (Nicolas Cage), a disgruntled ex-cop, Hit Girl is a walking DOCS nightmare; the sweetest l'il psychopath in New York City. We meet this lethal poppet when she comes to the rescue of Kick-Ass, a wannabe superhero who has wandered recklessly into an enclave of hardened drug dealers. Decked out in a ludicrous green wetsuit bought online, Kick-Ass is really Dave Lizewski, a high school comic book freak whose only superpowers are invisibility to girls and hyper-inflated optimism. (He's played by the likable Aaron Johnson, who does American geek as convincingly as he did nascent Beatle in Nowhere Boy.) After one humiliation too many, Dave invents his alter-ego, obtains a couple of ninja sticks and sets out into the night, pausing only to set up Kick-Ass's MySpace profile. On his second mission, Kick-Ass rescues a man from three assailants while a café full of onlookers records the incident on their mobiles. Now an overnight YouTube phenomenon, Kick-Ass catches the attention of local crime boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), whose couriers have been encountering mysterious costumed resistance. D'Amico's spoiled son Chris (Superbad's marvellously dweebish Christopher Mintz-Plasse) happens to attend the same school as Dave, and has a plan to catch the unwitting amateur crusader for his dad.When he's not dressing up like Jacques Cousteau, Dave is trying to win the affections of schoolmate Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca), who has erroneously adopted him as her "gay BFF". (The movie knowingly incorporates the X-Men subtext of costumed heroics as a code for queerness.) His desire to impress Katie with his manliness is leading him into a world of pain, where seriously evil people clash with heavily armed killers like Hit Girl and Big Daddy.  There's a grand tradition of European directors - Paul Verhoeven, Luc Besson - approaching American action films with an irreverent, off-kilter sadism that often strikes a chord with the public. Vaughn, the British director of Layer Cake, has no qualms about ruffling American sensibilities in his faithful adaptation of the savagely silly Kick-Ass comic book by Scotsman Mark Millar. With its prepubescent girl killer, allusions to online jihadist executions and superhero aspirations that fall to earth spectacularly, Kick-Ass seems to have cult hit written all over it, except that in this interactive age, cults have gone mainstream. The box office should be massive. Nick Dent]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[There are those of us who can watch brainy Tina Fey bobble around 30 Rock for hours, and drink up her every self-deprecating zinger like freshly brewed espresso. (As for the others who don’t get her—we understand Sarah Palin has a new show.) Still, there’s no reason why Fey, so dynamic on the small screen, has to get Anistoned out of a proper Hollywood crossover. Baby Mama (2008) was cringingly mediocre; indeed, one has to cast back to 2004’s tangy, Fey-scripted Mean Girls to get a reasonable glimmer of her talent. Even then, we were still watching Lindsay Lohan.
Date Night isn’t going to alter this conundrum—it makes you laugh in fits and starts, but more often it feels toothless and exhausted, the kind of project that exists to give Ray Liotta work. (The generic script is by Shrek-sequel scribe Josh Klausner.)
Fey is almost perfectly paired with Steve Carell as bored, married New Jerseyites Claire and Phil: The way they trade quips and cast snide aspersions at strangers, the actors seem totally believable as intellectual mates and, more crucially, deeply in danger of losing intimacy. After stealing a reservation at a clichéd-snobby NYC eatery, the couple is mistaken for blackmailers and pursued by goons, North by Northwest–style, throughout the city.
You know where this is going; shouty misadventures in a slow-moving motorboat, a clamorous car chase and an exclusive sex club will surely move them out of the “most excellent roommates” category. When Mark Wahlberg shows up as a shirtless tech-heavy spy—one who can also flirt in Hebrew—he almost constitutes a joke in himself. But can’t there at least be faster fish for Fey and Carell to shoot in the barrel? Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The stylish opening of The Book of Eli - a lateral camera track through an ashen forest - attests to the spellbinding talents of ace cinematographer Don Burgess. His moody and immersive visuals (most notably a shoot-out filmed, Children of Men-style, in an illusory single take) lend weight to this otherwise rote postapocalyptic tale from Allen and Albert Hughes (From Hell).
A mean motherfuckin’ servant of God (Washington) shepherds a mysterious book to some unknown locale out West. (The tome’s identity is fairly obvious, despite the calculatedly hushed, oblique tones used to speak about it.) After a stopover in a decrepit outpost, the holy warrior attracts the attention of a snake-tongued saloon owner (Oldman) who wants to use the book for his own diabolical purposes. Cue guns-’n’-ammo showdowns, not to mention voluminous product placement - the J.Crew and Motorola conglomerates bedevil us even in the end-times.
A spunky sidekick (Kunis’s irritating barmaid) and character-role cameos (Michael Gambon, Malcolm McDowell and Tom Waits) round out this vision of a world where “Ring My Bell” played on an antique Victrola is meant to stoke nostalgia. Thank the pallid green heavens for Flashdance’s Jennifer Beals, positively ravishing as a sightless kept woman who acts as the story’s oracle. She wanders the halls of her makeshift prison like a goddess deprived of power, and ultimately takes an elatingly bloodless revenge on her captor. For a few brief moments, the film becomes something close to Greek mythology, as opposed to graphic-novel imitator. What a feeling! Keith Uhlich]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Eighties Hollywood was a crazy kind of place where mannequins became real girls, people swapped bodies and genders, high school seniors acquired the ability to open bras with telekenesis, and mogwai should never, ever be fed after midnight. There was no male sexual neurosis that screenwriters could not compensate for with an improbable high concept. This is the territory that Steve Pink's Hot Tub Time Machine is mining in its story of directionless 40 year olds who find themselves back in the 80s with the chance to rewrite their own fates. It's Back to the Future infused with the fratboy spirit of Animal House, and a comedy that is smart enough to embrace its own stupidity and run with it.  Adam (John Cusack) has just had another relationship break up, and can't shake the feeling he should never have dumped his high school sweetheart Jennie (Lyndsy Fonseca). Nick (Craig Robinson) has a dead-end job in a pooch pampering parlour and wishes he'd never quit his music career. Lou (Rob Corddry) is a rampaging party monster whose hedonism masks an inner emptiness. When Lou parties a little too hard one evening and ends up in hospital, Adam has the idea of a therapeutic sentimental journey back to the ski lodge where as teens they once had their best holiday ever. They bring along for the ride Adam's 20-year-old nephew Jake (Clark Duke) in the hope he'll drop his Nintendo and pop his cherry. After an all-night binge in their suite's hot tub they find themselves back in 1986. The clothes are garish, the president's an actor, mobile phones are gigantic and so is the hair. Should the boys remake their lives anew, or focus on getting back to 2010 while being careful not to affect the future? In the meantime they must navigate all the familiar tropes from 80s teen sex comedies: nasty jocks, Cold War paranoia, and sexually compliant girls ready to redeem nerds with their fleshy favours. A patron saint of bad 80s movies, Chevy Chase, appears as the mysterious hot tub repairman, and Back to the Future's Crispin Glover plays a happy-go-lucky bellhop destined to meet with a nasty accident.Hot Tub Time Machine might be irredeemable trash if it wasn't fast, funny and packed with killer one-liners delivered by a cast of seasoned comics. (The Office's Robinson is especially good.) Crude and crass it may be, but it never sinks to the leaden depths of an actual 80s teen comedy. There's also a sadness behind its knockabout, wish-fulfilment antics: the desperation of Adam, Nick and Lou to reclaim their masculinity from the ravages of time - the ultimate buzzkiller. Forty-year-old yobs rejoice: your ultimate guilty pleasure movie has arrived. Nick Dent]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[Iron Man 2]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[The X-Men, Spider-Man and Batman movies have proven that the second instalment is where a comic-book blockbuster series finds its feet: with all those pesky origin details out of the way, the filmmakers can focus on raising the stakes, deepening the characters and ramping up the action. And for the first 45 minutes or so, this is where Iron Man 2 looks to be heading. Director Jon Favreau sets the stage for a titanic three-way conflagration as Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is under investigation by the US government following the public revelation of his superhero persona, while his arch rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) is scrambling after his technology and mysterious, musclebound Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) is up to unspecified no-good. The dialogue crackles, the special effects pop and the onscreen action never flags, climaxing with an astonishing multi-car pileup at the Monaco Grand Prix, where Iron Man meets his nemesis Vanko, aka Whiplash, for the first time. So far, so excellent: Favreau builds on the solid foundations of the first movie, and success looks guaranteed. But slowly, imperceptibly, it all starts to fall apart during the remaining hour or so. A major problem is the number of characters: Downey, Rockwell and Rourke are obviously all enjoying themselves enormously, but the same can’t be said for Don Cheadle as Stark’s redundant buddy-cum-sidekick Rhodes. Nor do the others seem to be having much fun: Gwyneth Paltrow is underused as Stark's assistant-cum-love interest Pepper Potts, while Scarlett Johansson’s Natalie is slinky but pointless. The less said about a perfunctory appearance from Samuel L Jackson as some sort of shady inter-agency bigwig the better. As the film plays out, it starts to look likely that all the rumours of reshoots and recuts weren’t just online rabble-rousing. Characters appear and vanish. Seemingly important plot details surface and are swept away. And this feels increasingly like a film which got lost in the edit. Whereas in the first act we jetted from Siberia to Washington to Monaco, the second half is mostly confined to a series of boardrooms, army bases and laboratories. A flat, studio-bound final showdown takes an age to arrive and is over in minutes. Iron Man 2 is a lot of fun: it’s shiny, likeable and never boring. But it’s also wildly uneven and unnecessarily convoluted, leaving the viewer unsatisfied and hungry for something more substantial. Let’s hope a promised third instalment can fulfil the series’ undeniable potential. Tom Huddleston]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[Bunny and the Bull]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[By the standards of British comic films, Bunny &amp; the Bull is formally adventurous, thematically conventional and emotionally tending towards the inert. Just as problematically, it’s not very funny. Bringing together elements of buddy flick, road movie and romance, its story follows meek, self-conscious Stephen (Edward Hogg) and his brash, hard-living pal Bunny (Simon Farnaby) on a ramshackle European tour, with Spanish waitress Eloisa (Veronica Echegui) tagging along for the ride. Their escapades are recalled from the interior of Stephen’s flat, which he hasn’t left in the year since the trip ended, and where he keeps everything from shower caps to urine neatly archived.

Director Paul King is a longtime collaborator of comedy duo The Mighty Boosh, whose TV series and live tours he directed (and who have characteristically outré cameos here). Like ‘Boosh’, Bunny &amp; the Bull revels in a playfully expressionistic milieu of stylised settings and handmade effects, realised here through various kinds of animation that bring Michel Gondry to mind; a clockwork fairground and cutlery-derived bull stand out, as does the desk-based credit sequence. The film’s action also elides the distinctions between reality, memory and delusion in an impressively sustained manner more familiar to stage than screen.

Much to appreciate, then, but less to enjoy. Bunny and Stephen remain largely if differently unsympathetic during their Withnail-esque travels and travails, and there’s little sense of passion in the latter’s tentative romance with Eloisa. Like him, the movie remains mired in a mood of frustration and mopiness that works against both emotional engagement and big laughs, however consistently tickling the picture’s narrative schema and production design might be.Ben Walters]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Michael Haneke is the patron saint of the post-cinema discussion. Moviegoers around the world file out of his films such as Hidden, Funny Games and Code Unknown, straight into cafés to argue not just the deeper meaning of his works, but what actually happened in them. His unnerving, tightly controlled mysteries are left open-ended, without any comforting solutions, and plenty of ideas to pick over.The White Ribbon, which won the Palme D'Or at Cannes a year ago, takes place in a small German village on the eve of World War One. The young village schoolmaster who narrates the film says that the mystery he's about to describe may "help to clarify some things that happened later in our country."The first of a series of strange events is when the local doctor (Rainer Block) breaks his collarbone falling off his horse. Someone has strung a wire between two trees to trip the animal up. Then, some time after a local farmer's wife dies in an accident at the Baron's sawmill, the Baron's young son is found tied up and tortured. Meanwhile, the local pastor (Burghart Klaußner) rules over his brood of six children with intense psychological cruelty. The white ribbon of the title refers to a piece of fabric the pastor ties to his kids to signify their lack of maturity. Throughout the film, the theme of children's innocence, or lack thereof, recurs. A wide-eyed four-year-old learns what death is from his 14-year-old sister, who may or may not be the victim of sexual abuse by her father. The stern pastor terrifies one of his sons with a fiction that masturbation will cover his body with pustules.We also meet the local steward (Josef Bierbichler) and his family, and the young nanny Eva (Leonie Benesch) who catches the school teacher's eye. (The White Ribbon involves a vast panoply of characters. Keep your eyes open, or you may get confused as to who's who.) Eichwald's picturesque appearance belies simmering tensions among the villagers to do with class, sex, and religion. As one character says near the end, it's a place of "malice, envy, apathy and brutality".This is a mesmerising and beautiful film that Haneke has shot in black and white. Some may find its lack of firm answers frustrating. Is Haneke saying something about the brutalised psyche of Germans going into the First World War and the subsequent rise of Nazism? The director has admitted that he likes to construct stories "so that several explanations are possible." It's a film that viewers who love a mental challenge - and coffee shop proprieters - should rejoice over. Nick Dent]]></review>

    <version lang="en">
      <name><![CDATA[Robin Hood]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[Burdened by the weight of
expectation, Robin Hood is over
long, overblown, and over hyped. As a result, this archer misses the bullseye.  The film starts promisingly
enough. After some Blackadder-y
Medieval scrolls set the olde worlde scene, we meet Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe), a
humble and courageous archer fighting the Crusades in France for Richard the
Lionheart (a very under-the-radar Danny Huston). When the king is killed in
battle, a decisive and brass-necked Longstride takes advantage of implausibly fortuitous coincidence to escape the
army and return to England considerably higher of rank and with a band of merry men.  But all is not so merry back
home. Bankrupted by the cost of the Crusades, the ambitious and head-strong new King John imposes
stringent taxes to recoup the losses, which brings an already struggling
country to its knees and on the brink of civil war.  France, sensing weakness and
in-fighting, hatches plans to invade England thanks to their man on the inside,
the double-crossing and self-serving British noble, Godfrey (Mark Strong).  In successfully re-uniting a
fractured country to see off the French, Robin enjoys a meteoric rise from foot
soldier to national hero. But King John, threatened by this new leader's sudden
popularity and unimpressed by his lack of nobility, casts him aside. This, then, is the origin
story behind the legend: the prequel that explains (with a fair amount of
literary license) how Robin Longstride the archer may have become Robin Hood
the outlaw. In ending where all the other Hoods have begun, director Ridley
Scott has probably engineered himself a new franchise. But in blowing over $140m on
this 140-minute epic, one could argue he himself has robbed from the rich and given us
something poor.  The main problem is, by once
again casting Crowe as an heroic warrior fighting all the odds for an honourable
cause, comparisons to Scott's Gladiator are unavoidable. (Oscar Isaac's King John shares more than a little DNA
in common with Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus, for example.) But next to The
Spaniard, this Englishman doesn't quite measure up. Nor, for that matter, is he as good
as Mel Gibson's William Wallace in Braveheart.
The Robin Hood plot is convoluted and at times ponderous, the battle scenes are a dizzying shakycam chaos of arrows and clanging metal, and several key characters remain disappointingly underdeveloped. We see little of Little John and the Sheriff of Nottingham barely features in this prequel – which is a shame. And just what are those
voices supposed to be? Scott's Robin Hood doesn't really know where he is from.
And judging from his accent, which veers laughably from Scouse to Scottish via ee-bah-gum
Yorkshire, neither do we. Perhaps this is deliberate, indicative of the
itinerant lifestyle of a career soldier. As Hood discovers by piecing together some submerged
flashback memories and exhuming long-buried emotions, he is from Nottingham. Which is, of course,
where he meets an ice maiden called Marian (Cate Blanchett), a blanched-out woman of nobility
who has fallen on tough times. But even her accent, while more consistent,
occasionally grates. When she yells "y'bastads!" at some looters who have stolen
her seed grain, our Cate sounds like a screeching council estate chav.  So what are the saving
graces? Though there is little
apparent chemistry between Robin and a very washed-out looking Marian, it's interesting to
have the two main characters played by seasoned pros who look battle-hardened
and, let's face it, a bit old. There is a realism to their relationship.
They don't so much fall in love as settle for each other. A formidable woman,
Blanchett is more than a ditzy love-interest. (Thank goodness they dropped the
originally-cast Sienna Miller.) Having wasted 10 years of her life waiting for
her husband who will never return from the Crusades, Marian pragmatically takes
what's on offer with an air of resignation. Well, she ain't getting any
younger.  For his part, Crowe looks
steely and stacked, every inch the leading man. He has lost a Friar Tuck-load of weight to be in his best shape in a decade – yes, since Gladiator.  Mark Strong gets strong
marks, cementing his growing reputation as the baddest villain on the big
screen. Without giving too much away, the expression on his face in his final
scene is wonderfully sinister.  And to his great credit, Scott
avoids the temptation to resort to Hollywood schmaltz and cliché (unlike Gladiator). Although half an hour too long, Robin Hood is a
gritty period drama with no room for romance. Even the final kiss at the film's denouement is tinged
with the metallic taste of blood.  If you are going to see Robin Hood,
don't wait for the DVD. While the set does look like a Disneyfied rendering of
Medieval England at times, visually the film has that epic quality that only
really works on the big screen.
The film as a whole is not terrible by any means. It's just not as good
as it should be. Go and see it without any high expectations whatsoever and you
won't feel robbed.Dan Rookwood]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In Wes Craven’s 1984 original, Nancy warned her boyfriend Glen,  a young Johnny Depp: "Whatever happens, don’t fall asleep." Heed this warning if you see this tedious ‘reimagining’ of Craven’s seminal slasher movie, because you’ll be struggling to stay awake. Inheriting Freddy Krueger’s iconic fedora and striped sweater from Robert Englund, former child star Jackie Earle Haley makes what he can of a hand-me-down role, slicing his way into the dreams of suburban teenagers. That said, Haley’s CGI-enhanced make-up makes more of an impression than his weak presence, ‘scary’ voice or lame one-liners.

After their friend is killed by an invisible attacker, emo girl Nancy (Rooney Mara) and misfit Quentin (Kyle Gallner) are convinced that her death is connected to a nightmare they’ve all been having and a dark Freddy Krueger-related secret their parents have kept from them – a secret the kids have all, in a convenient act of collective amnesia, repressed since nursery school. Now Freddy is back, invading their dreams and threatening to kill them in their sleep.

The makers clearly couldn’t decide between a prequel or remake, so they and first-time director Samuel Bayer have jammed both together. Heather Langenkamp’s wimpy portrayal of Nancy was the original’s weak point, and here Mara’s Nancy slips between the somnambulant and the catatonic. This is the worst yet from Michael Bay’s horror production company Platinum Dunes, which also brought you rubbish re-makes of Halloween and Friday the 13th.Nigel Floyd]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[Harry Brown]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[I ended up feeling a bit sorry for Michael Caine by the time this hateful vigilante flick set in modern-day London came to a close. Did the old boy know what he was getting into? The funny thing is that Harry Brown, bar a violent prologue, begins fairly soberly, even reflectively, as if the makers were thinking more of All or Nothing than Death Wish. Harry (Caine, below) is a widower who shuffles around a crumbling housing estate with only fellow army vet Leonard (David Bradley) for company. But life changes when Leonard falls prey to the hoodies who linger in the local underpass. When distraught Harry gets short shrift from the police (badly written, and poorly played by Emily Mortimer and Charlie Creed-Miles), he decides to take the law into his own hands and drives this already wobbly wagon straight into hysterical genre territory. By now, all you can do is sigh, laugh and try not to get upset at the stupidity of it all.

Although it takes a while before Harry Brown shows its true colours, there’a a vulgar whiff from the off: in the first seconds of this debut from director Daniel Barber (who, technically, shows a fair amount of talent) we watch grainy mobile footage of a kid on a scooter as he confronts a young mum and shoots her dead before he comes a cropper himself on the road. It’s horrible stuff, but there must be a good reason for it, surely?

As it turns out, this scene is the first hint of the sick ideology of the film, in which ill-informed pessimism is bolstered by childish ideas of revenge. There’s always a punishment around the corner, not only to avenge bad behaviour but also to give the makers sneaky licence to indulge in violence. As narrative – and moral – maths go, this is a cooking of the books that sidesteps any smart commentary on real life.

      <review><![CDATA[Hands up who ever thought they’d see the director of Four Weddings and a Funeral making a Jerry Bruckheimer movie – and a video game adaptation to boot? As with his instalment in the 'Harry Potter’ saga, Mike Newell was clearly brought in to add a touch of dramatic gravitas to this flimsiest of summer blockbusters. It’s a strategy which pays off – but only just.

The plot feels cobbled together from myriad sources: a pinch of The Thief of Baghdad, a smattering of The Mummy and a hefty dollop of The Thousand and One Nights. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Dastan, a one-time street urchin (natch) elevated to Persian Princeling by the generosity of good King Sharaman. But when Dastan goes against his two brothers and their scheming uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley, whose moustache is just too short to twirl malevolently), he’s framed for the king’s murder and flees into the desert with only his camel and a bad-tempered princess (Gemma Arterton) for company. 

As this synopsis suggests, Newell and his screenwriters leave no historical fantasy cliché unmolested, and that’s before we get to the mystical dagger, the supernatural assassins and Alfred Molina as a jolly, morally dubious gambler. The story does feel overfamiliar and suffers from a lack of dramatic tension as a consequence. Matters aren’t helped by shoddy CGI and some seriously silly last-act developments.

But Newell keeps things moving at a lick, barely allowing his actors a pause for breath between bouts of knockabout banter before chucking them into another athletic action scene. And Gyllenhaal is good value, his natural vulnerability working to offset some slightly alarming action-hero abs. Prince of Persia won’t linger long in the memory – but then it probably wasn’t meant to. Tom Huddleston]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Animal Kingdom grips from its opening scene. Joshua ‘J' Cody (James Frecheville), 17, is staring vacantly at a TV game show while his mum snoozes on the couch next to him. Except that she's not snoozing; she has overdosed, fatally, on heroin, and her son doesn't quite know what to do next. So he calls his estranged grandma, Janine ‘Smurf' Cody (Jacki Weaver), who tells him to pack his bags, and gently, reassuringly invites him into the lions' den.

Janine lives with her three sons, J's uncles - the young one, Craig (Luke Ford), the nervous one, Darren (Sullivan Stapleton) and the ringleader, Andrew ‘Pope' Cody (Ben Mendelsohn). The Cody boys, together with Barry Brown (Joel Edgerton), are notorious armed robbers, under constant police surveillance. Crime isn't paying like it used to, and Barry wants to go straight, but Pope doesn't know any other life. A drug user with huge personality problems, Pope is the alpha male of the pack, and ashen-faced Mendelsohn plays him as a moral blank, a man staring into the abyss, jumping at shadows.

When one of their gang is killed by police, Pope's vengeance is swift and brutal, and J finds himself an accessory to murder. Enter Detective Senior Sergeant Nathan Leckie (Guy Pearce), who hopes to convince J to testify against the family. There's a difference between being strong, he explains to J, and the illusion of strength from being under the protection of the seemingly strong. J is no fool and realises that Uncle Pope would kill him at the slightest suspicion of grassing. What's a boy got to do to survive?

Drawn from the recent history of Melbourne's gangland, former Inside Film editor David Mîchod's debut feature outshines any crime thriller ever made in this country. Mîchod spent nine years honing his screenplay and it shows. Miraculously cliché-free, its every scene is surprising yet believable, building to an epic climax hinged on revelations about character. Mendelsohn is chilling, and newcomer James Frecheville is excellent as J, moving from inarticulate teen observer to trapped participant. Even better is Jacki Weaver as Smurf, the mother hen to this family of rotten eggs. Doting, chirpy and kissy-kissy, she smiles like a pixie but her eyes are as cold as a shark's. It's a magnificent performance by one of our national treasures.

Destined to be an international arthouse hit, this portrayal of power struggles in an underworld dynasty may be the closest thing we get to an Australian Godfather. Of course, while those smart capitalists the Corleones thrive and prosper, the small-time Codys are on the way out – but no species of carnivore surrenders to extinction without a fight. Nick Dent

      <review><![CDATA[We’re so used to amped-up white-knucklers that the controlled approach of a filmmaker like Roman Polanski is immediately seductive. The director responsible for such mainstays as Chinatown and Rosemary’s Baby (and of course his own real-life news cycle) turns Robert Harris’s political potboiler involving a ghostwriter (McGregor), a former British prime minister (Brosnan) and an isolated island home into a slow-burn near-masterpiece. Shot in claustrophobic widescreen, the film showcases Polanski’s mastery of even expository scenes: A revealing conversation between McGregor’s so-called ghost and a shady figure played by Tom Wilkinson is so fraught with tension that you expect those malevolent Cocteau-esque hands from Repulsion to burst out of the wall and drag someone into oblivion.
The film stays more grounded than that, though it certainly doesn’t lack for perverse Polanski flourishes. There’s a great bit of carnal business with the prime minister’s wife (Williams) that’s filmed in a deadpan long shot. Eli Wallach pops up—frail-looking though spirited—as an old-timer who stokes the writer’s paranoia about his employer’s plans for him. And more than one character has a wry aside on the protagonist’s heritage (“Oh, you Brits!”), as if it was both a badge of honor and a reason for condescending suspicion.
There are all number of similarly colorful touches (the sick-joke ending alone is worth the price of admission) that help to deepen what one colleague suggested is the greatest airport novel ever filmed. It’s true that The Ghost Writer doesn’t possess the lingering profundity of the director’s best work—the War on Terror window dressing is just that. Yet Polanski has made a genre piece with a verve and vitality that’s in sadly short supply. Keith Uhlich]]></review>

    <version lang="en">
      <name><![CDATA[I Am Love]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[A work of masterly daring and skill, the new Italian film I Am Love plays out in the late 1990s within a super-rich family called the Recchis. Their power base is a Milanese villa introduced to us by young director Luca Guadagnino as a gilded cage – a marble-and-stone palace too large and ornate to support intimate family life. In the film’s early scenes Guadagnino laps up this mansion, exploring it with a swirling, fluid camera that turns its world into a character itself. The fictional Recchis recall the Agnellis,  another troubled industrialist family which feathered its nest on the back of fascism, but they trade in textiles, not cars, and Guadagnino gives us a brief shot of their mechanised looms at work to stress how business is woven into the fabric of this family’s soul.

We meet the Recchis on the cusp of change – and change is the film’s main interest, along with the dangerous strength necessary for any woman to counter the forces of tradition and expectation in such a family. We begin by watching the elderly family head (Gabriele Ferzetti) at dinner as he nominates his successors in a scene of ‘King Lear’-like power and unnaturalness. But soon he is dead and our focus and heroine becomes Emma Recchi (Tilda Swinton), the dutiful Russian wife of Tancredi (Pippo Delbono), the family’s new head, and mother to two grown-up sons and a daughter attempting her own flight from this patriarchal world. Emma’s burgeoning friendship with her son’s business partner, Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini), a rural chef, is the nudge that will bring this house of cards down in dramatic, tragic fashion. 

The story is bold enough, but true daring is at play in the film’s style. Guadagnino has the confidence to mix big, brash ‘Dallas’-style establishing shots of Milan and London and complicated scenes of busy parties with much more intimate, expressive moments. Dialogue becomes less important as the film progresses, and Guadagnino invites us to read the film rather than the characters’ lips. He also manages to bring the film to an operatic crescendo without losing sight of emotional realities.

There are many reasons to recommend this sensual and good-looking film about personal and female liberation. The music is one; it is central to a work that demands that all the film’s elements work together to create a total cinema. Guadagnino and his star and co-producer, Swinton, persuaded John Adams, the composer of operas such as Nixon in China and Doctor Atomic, to allow his work to be used in a film for the first time and his crashing, arresting, impulsive music is gripping from the start.

It’s a fitting collaboration. Adams has given modern opera a much-needed shot in the arm and that’s what Swinton (who speaks Italian throughout) and Guadagnino are striving to achieve: ‘I Am Love’ is a brazen blueprint for a cinema that straddles past and future while worrying little about trends of the present. It’s a bold experiment rooted in tradition. It plays like smart opera and looks like a marriage of poetic documentary with classical European drama. Swinton and Guadagnino call it ‘Visconti on acid’ and that’s as good a phrase as any to describe the film’s intoxicating allure. Dave Calhoun]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A work of masterly daring and skill, the new Italian film I Am Love plays out in the late 1990s within a super-rich family called the Recchis. Their power base is a Milanese villa introduced to us by young director Luca Guadagnino as a gilded cage – a marble-and-stone palace too large and ornate to support intimate family life. In the film’s early scenes Guadagnino laps up this mansion, exploring it with a swirling, fluid camera that turns its world into a character itself. The fictional Recchis recall the Agnellis,  another troubled industrialist family which feathered its nest on the back of fascism, but they trade in textiles, not cars, and Guadagnino gives us a brief shot of their mechanised looms at work to stress how business is woven into the fabric of this family’s soul.

We meet the Recchis on the cusp of change – and change is the film’s main interest, along with the dangerous strength necessary for any woman to counter the forces of tradition and expectation in such a family. We begin by watching the elderly family head (Gabriele Ferzetti) at dinner as he nominates his successors in a scene of ‘King Lear’-like power and unnaturalness. But soon he is dead and our focus and heroine becomes Emma Recchi (Tilda Swinton), the dutiful Russian wife of Tancredi (Pippo Delbono), the family’s new head, and mother to two grown-up sons and a daughter attempting her own flight from this patriarchal world. Emma’s burgeoning friendship with her son’s business partner, Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini), a rural chef, is the nudge that will bring this house of cards down in dramatic, tragic fashion. 

The story is bold enough, but true daring is at play in the film’s style. Guadagnino has the confidence to mix big, brash ‘Dallas’-style establishing shots of Milan and London and complicated scenes of busy parties with much more intimate, expressive moments. Dialogue becomes less important as the film progresses, and Guadagnino invites us to read the film rather than the characters’ lips. He also manages to bring the film to an operatic crescendo without losing sight of emotional realities.

There are many reasons to recommend this sensual and good-looking film about personal and female liberation. The music is one; it is central to a work that demands that all the film’s elements work together to create a total cinema. Guadagnino and his star and co-producer, Swinton, persuaded John Adams, the composer of operas such as Nixon in China and Doctor Atomic, to allow his work to be used in a film for the first time and his crashing, arresting, impulsive music is gripping from the start.

It’s a fitting collaboration. Adams has given modern opera a much-needed shot in the arm and that’s what Swinton (who speaks Italian throughout) and Guadagnino are striving to achieve: ‘I Am Love’ is a brazen blueprint for a cinema that straddles past and future while worrying little about trends of the present. It’s a bold experiment rooted in tradition. It plays like smart opera and looks like a marriage of poetic documentary with classical European drama. Swinton and Guadagnino call it ‘Visconti on acid’ and that’s as good a phrase as any to describe the film’s intoxicating allure. Dave Calhoun]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[You’ve watched these scenes before, awful in their heartbreak, most memorably in Saving Private Ryan: Steven Spielberg frames an army mother in silhouette as uniformed men approach her doorway, solemnly removing their caps. She sinks to her knees, the news too hard to bear.
The Messenger focuses specifically and tenderly on these moments, and on the stern but damaged men who perform such duties on a daily basis. The reactions don’t go as smoothly as with Mrs. Ryan. A bitter father can’t believe his daughter has married “that greaseball” until they both hear the KIA report, and he can only hold her while she screams. Wives fall ruined; a gardening dad (Steve Buscemi, in a powerful cameo) can only spit his rage: “Why aren’t you dead?”
And maybe they are a little dead. Notification trainee Will (Foster) served heroically in Iraq but seems to have left a bit of his soul behind. His new boss, an imposing mountain of a man, Captain Stone (Harrelson, at his finest), hides his own loneliness behind the procedures of proper respect and a script they have to read. Directed by a newcomer, Oren Moverman (the cowriter of Todd Haynes’s Bob Dylan fantasia, I’m Not There), the movie does an uncommonly sensitive job probing the psychologies of blocked men, less so the urges of a widow who needs more than comforting words. (As played by the great Samantha Morton, you’ll forgive this obvious plot trajectory.) Though it feels a little too indie-ish in its wallowing misery, The Messenger signals the start of strong year-end work. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[After a fine start to the decade with 24 Hour Party People, the British music film has become an increasingly drab prospect. Sanitised, reverential biopics like Control and Nowhere Boy have reduced our most vital rock legends to overanalysed everymen, robbing them of power and mystery in an effort to ‘understand’ them – a pointless and impossible task best left to the cultural scholars.

But Road to Guantanamo director Mat Whitecross is having none of it. Tackling the rise and fall of bolshy proto-punk gobshite Ian Dury, Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll is a riot of clattering noise and kaleidoscopic colour, off-kilter imagery and foul language, all the good things the title promises and much more. Taking his cue not just from former collaborator Michael Winterbottom’s celebrated Factory exposé but from Todd Haynes’s ramshackle, revisionist rock ’n’ roll masterpieces, Velvet Goldmine and I’m Not There, Whitecross presents Dury as a verbally abusive, dishonest, thoroughly disreputable but endlessly fascinating lyrical genius, exploring his past in a way that informs – but never seeks to explain – his present.

That present is the mid-’70s, the period in which Dury (Andy Serkis)  split from his old band Kilburn And The High Roads – and from long-suffering spouse Betty (Olivia Williams) – to form the Blockheads, with whom he would achieve stellar homegrown success. Taking up with teenage tearaway Denise (Naomie Harris), Dury attempts to juggle the demands of family, fame and mounting alcoholism, but always ends up putting his own needs first.

It’s this refusal to sugarcoat Dury’s shortcomings that really impresses: yes, Whitecross and screenwriter Paul Viragh ask us to empathise with their self-pitying, class-obsessed, emotionally and physically crippled hero, but they never expect us to forgive his excesses. Serkis’s performance is remarkable, alternating between Gollum-esque bug-eyed lunacy and a more subtle, heartfelt portrait of a life in turmoil. 

A scene in which Dury revisits the hospital where he spent his childhood, coming face to face with a new generation of angry young outcasts, is quietly heartbreaking: sentimental, perhaps, but entirely schmaltz-free. Similarly, the central relationship between Dury and twitchy pre-teen son Baxter (a superb Bill Milner) does a great job of outlining the unpredictable lows and (often literal) highs of having a deadbeat pop star for a father. You don’t need to be a fan of Dury’s music to enjoy ‘Sex &amp; Drugs…’. This is just gorgeous, celebratory cinema, unfettered and courageous, if unashamedly scattershot, much like the man himself. Forget young Lennon and his tedious Oedipal angst – this is the one by which a new decade of music movies will be judged. Tom Huddleston]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Banksy has a weird relationship with fame. Let’s call it the ‘reverse Lohan’: he’s famous for not being famous. He breeds celebrity then rejects it. Just last year he was the subject of an odd film made by the ICA’s ex-chairman Ivan Massow called Banksy’s Coming to Dinner, in which an actor duped Joan Collins into believing she was hosting a dinner party for the street artist. All signs suggest Collins was party to the gag. But was Banksy also in on it? Probably not. But still it fed his notoriety.
His anonymity is a handy tease – a tool which allows him to draw attention to himself while at the same time deflecting it.
This is the spirit of Exit through the Gift Shop, a new documentary brought to us by Banksy but not directed by him (the film has no such credit). It profiles Banksy and prods at issues raised by his success, from originality to commercialisation. But it’s a wonky, sideways profile in that the film pretends not to be about Banksy.
He – or whoever made the film – employs a fall guy to make himself look good. It's passive self-promotion. Some even say it's a hoax. But that’s missing the point: even if the final section of the film doesn’t feel as honest as the earlier parts, there’s nothing to suggest that the whole thing is made up (which is different from savvy editing and presentation). Part of the problem is that we expect a Banksy project to be a joke on us. Whatever the film is, it’s sparky and funny and invigorating to watch.
The fall guy – Banksy’s mirror – is Thierry Guetta, a hipster French exile in Los Angeles introduced to us from the beginning as obsessed with video cameras and looking for an outlet for a creeping early middle-aged ennui. Essentially the film has two narrators: Rhys Ifans, buoying the story along in voiceover, and Banksy, who pops up occasionally in silhouette to offer commentary. Both lend their voice to a mass of archive footage, much of it shot by Guetta, who, we’re told, started filming his cousin Invader (the French bloke who plasters mosaics everywhere) in the late 90s and moved on to other artists, including Shepard Fairey and Banksy.
We’re told that after many years of filming these artists on roofs, at night or in their studios, Guetta edited his footage into a mess called Life Remote Control. Which is where Banksy decided to take over and turn the archive into something watchable. Which is where we join the party.
The cheeky twist in the tale is that Guetta, encouraged by Banksy, then becomes an artist too. He exhibits and sells work at a hyped-up Los Angeles show, and all the signs are that Banksy is closer to this late creative flowering than he admits. Most of Guetta’s works look like D-grade Banksy rip-offs and there’s a sense that there’s a smart mind behind this ‘bad’ work, which includes a giant aerosol can labelled with branding for ‘Campbell’s Tomato Spray’.
So, whether Guetta’s burgeoning art career is under the patronage or direction of Banksy – or both – is the question you must take away. Whatever the answer, the film is a rousing tribute to street art, a crafty autobiography and a cheeky comment on the bravado of artists, talented or otherwise, and the gullibility of their punters – us included.

      <review><![CDATA[Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her fashion-conscious gal pals are back, and they’re taking the girl-power hi-jinks to a whole new level. First things first, though: the gay, gay, gay wedding of bestest friends Anthony Marantino (Mario Cantone) and Stanford Blatch (Willie Garson), where chorus boys sing ‘Sunrise, Sunset’, swans frolic among the guests, and Liza Minnelli officiates. Watching that queerest of queer icons risk her umpteenth hip replacement by performing Beyoncé’s ‘Single Ladies’ (dance moves and all!) is as suspenseful as a Hitchcock set-piece, and a difficult act to top.

So writer-director Michael Patrick King doesn’t even try. Instead, after this camp overture, we’re plunged headfirst into Carrie and friends’ familiar mock-troubled paradise: Ms Bradshaw’s relationship with the debonair Mr Big (Chris Noth) is moving further toward stifling domesticity. Neurotic mother Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is worried her braless live-in nanny has the hots for her hubby. Lawyer Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) quits her job after too many put-downs from her chauvinist boss. And Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is, well, horny as fuck. What a great time to take an all-expenses-paid trip to Abu Dhabi!

Taken in hand by this formidable foursome, the big, bad Middle East becomes a menopausal Westerner’s delight. One wrongheaded jaw-dropper follows another, from Samantha’s description of a gay manservant as ‘Paula Abdul’ to a comic climax in which the ladies escape an angry male mob by wearing hijabs and abayas given to them by like-minded Muslim women. And the featherbrained feminism the franchise specialises in reaches its apex when Carrie files her latest book, ‘I Do. Do I?’, beside Susan Sontag’s ‘Against Interpretation’. How do you say, ‘In your dreams, girlfriend’ in Arabic? Keith Uhlich]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Married-rich radical M.I.A. might be having press problems these days, but they’re nothing compared with the pretensions of fictional rocker Aldous Snow (squirmy, effortlessly charming Brand). Get Him to the Greek opens with a devastatingly funny parody - a video for Snow’s self-serious "African Child," described by shocked music critics as the worst thing to happen to the continent since apartheid. Seven years of infamy lead the debauched frontman to agree to a comeback concert, the brainstorm of superfan label-rep Aaron (Hill). After sparring with his workaholic girlfriend (Mad Men’s Moss, an unlikely partner), Aaron is on his way to London to shepherd Snow to the L.A. concert, scheduled to occur in three days.
And we’re off. When the movie remembers to be the drug-spiked, hard-R comedy you hope for, it’s more than just a fun romp (and, incidentally, superior to Forgetting Sarah Marshall, the rom-com from which its Britpop libertine spins off). It’s an unusually fast and inventive scramble through New York TV studios and Vegas party clubs. The heavyset Hill is beginning to cultivate a likable John Candy–esque appeal; playing against the surprisingly sharp Sean Combs, as a hellacious boss, he grounds the movie in approachability as the orbiting players get crazier.
So what’s with the Almost Famous rooftop jump and bummer left-turn? Writer-director Nicholas Stoller can’t really be expecting us to view his movie as a referendum on rock &amp; roll lifestyles; relationship arguments and daddy issues begin to cloud what started out as a perfectly black-lit satire. A climactic three-way in Aaron’s apartment has less oomph than a Lars Ulrich cameo. You desperately want the movie to be bad again. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The sensitive touch of Rodrigo García—a talented HBO house director (In Treatment, Carnivàle) with an extremely spotty feature career (Nine Lives, Passengers) - keeps this gimmicky ensemble melodrama out of the bullshit-detector red zone. As in most of his films, women take center stage: Middle-aged health-care worker Karen (Bening) is the biological mother of icy power attorney Elizabeth (Watts), whom she gave up for adoption immediately after birth. In a seemingly unrelated thread, the slightly manic baker Lucy (Washington) prepares to adopt a child of her own, since she’s been unable to conceive. All three live in Los Angeles, but none of them have ever met. Uh-oh.
Much as Nine Lives hinged on an aesthetic stunt (each sequence was filmed in a single shot), Mother and Child borrows the “we’re-all-connected” converging narrative patented by executive producer Alejandro González Iñárritu (Babel). It remains an annoying, faux-profound structural tic—at this point, there are no more returns to diminish - though this doesn’t negate the stellar performances García gets from his central female trio.
Watts is the most immediately attention-grabbing, with the story dictating that Elizabeth move from legal-eagle whore of Babylon (a terrific Samuel L. Jackson plays her willing prey) to martyred, maternal saint. A believably unbalanced Bening scores the movie’s true coup: Karen’s revitalizing relationship with a sweetly persistent coworker (Jimmy Smits) is a rare example of Hollywood doing right by midlife romance. And Washington, because she’s the least caught up in the twisted-pretzel plotting, gives Lucy’s every gesture the hallmark of truth. Everything else, sad to say, is just Hallmark.

      <review><![CDATA[From the moment that DreamWorks unleashed its jolly green animated franchise in 2001, the adaptation of William Steig’s popular children’s book found that sweet spot of appeal to both parents and kids. Children got ogre-fart jokes and Eddie Murphy’s manic jackassery; adults chuckled knowingly at pomo references and the subtleties of the Gingerbread Man screaming “Eat me!” Four chapters later, any attempts at satisfying both the prepubescent and the postcollegiate mind-sets have been shrugged aside, but what’s truly head-scratching is which way the series ended up skewing.
Shrek Forever After (is that a threat?) kicks off with a montage of our hero (Myers) in a domesticated rut: feed and change the brood, go about the daily routine of middle-class indignities, have dinner with the same group of friends, rinse and repeat—ad infinitum. Finally, Shrek suffers a nervous breakdown - what else would you call a rage spiral that ends with smashing your fist into a birthday cake? - and is suckered into a Faustian bargain with Rumpelstiltskin (Dohrn). It’s one thing to sell scatological gags to grown-ups, but pitching kids a toon version of It’s a Wonderful Life? Seriously?
Such a sideways move toward maturity might be applaudable if the rest of the film weren’t just desperately beating a dead cash cow. Third times are rarely charms in the movies, much less fourth go-rounds, and it takes more than ho-hum 3D and video-game-ready action sequences to liven up diminishing returns. When a chubby tabby is given the best lines, alienating the 12-and-under set with midlife crises might be the least of your problems. David Fear]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Sunnyside, the day-care center where the delightful new Toy Story occurs, might be a paradise - especially for Woody (Hanks), Buzz (Allen) and a gang facing obsolescence. (Andy is off to college and his mom has broken out the Hefty bags.) But in the sternly orotund warning of one Mr. Pricklepants (ex-Bond Timothy Dalton), it’s “a place of ruin and despair,” peopled with violent, drooling tykes and ruled with a plush fist by Lots-o’-Huggin’ Bear (the extraordinary Beatty), whose strawberry scent and harmonica-swaddled folksiness hide a sadist.
Clearly, Pixar’s genius for adventurous storytelling continues unabated; a prison film would seem to be the furthest idea from safe, but the tale (by director Lee Unkrich, John Lasseter and Wall-E’s Andrew Stanton) poses a serious challenge to the old saw of terrible second sequels. As always, the fun with this franchise comes from elaborate sequences of escape, stressing the plastic, resourceful nature of our heroes. This third chapter has some doozies, especially the jaw-dropper where spy Mr. Potato Head slips out of his skin, reassembling in the body of a floppy tortilla. (Watch out for that pesky pigeon, though.)
Why, then, are we not quite at the highest rank? There’s no avoiding the dark twinge of rejection that such a story inevitably courts; there are moments—the toys wandering through a dump’s wasteland of fire and swirling trash—when you might be reminded of Steven Spielberg’s depressing robot fantasia Artificial Intelligence. Still, humanity shines through the brighter comic lines. “Authority derives from the consent of the governed, not by force!” shouts a small, firm voice; her name is Barbie, and even Ken is stunned.

      <review><![CDATA[Once upon a time, a nebbishy New Yorker could fall for a willowy shiksa goddess and you could call it Annie Hall. No longer. Now, the whole movie’s got to be set in Los Angeles (not just one Christmas sequence), our love object barely gets a single “la-di-da,” and forget about naming the film after her. We’ve got inner male pain to address.
That shift, though, is precisely what makes Greenberg, Noah Baumbach’s latest comedy-drama, so car-crash-arresting and emblematic of Gen X self-absorption. Baumbach, an expert at skewering urbane pretensions (The Squid and the Whale), has conceived a remarkably sour character in Ben Stiller’s furious letter writer and fortyish layabout, Roger Greenberg. Once a college-rock musician, he scotched his band’s momentum in a fit of principle and now suffers the consequences: occasional work at carpentry and pride-swallowing in the home of his much wealthier brother. A ratty Steve Winwood T-shirt speaks volumes, as does a shelf of meds and a constant stream of bile directed at partygoing kids who scare him with their potential. Roger’s just not fun to be around.
Baumbach’s idea here is to find an expiration date on boyishness—it’s tempting to compare Greenberg to the more-trenchant The Anniversary Party (2001), also a shrewd examination of the limits of youthful decadence (and partly created by the filmmaker’s wife, Jennifer Jason Leigh, as is this). This movie corrects its wobbly, negative spiral with the romantic development of Florence (Gerwig, spacey as ever), a personal assistant to Roger’s sib and perhaps a salvation. Scratch that perhaps: Greenberg only slightly misses the top flight by settling for too weak a foil. (The better option, Rhys Ifans’s bruised bandmate, is right there.) But when Stiller indulges in moments of unfulfilled rage, this has real desperation. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Like flies to wanton schoolboys are humans to Predators – they hunt us for their sport. But at least when they drop us onto verdant alien worlds to be picked off one by one, we're given a fighting chance and allowed a full armoury of guns'n'ammo. And it's not just any old unsuspecting humans dumped onto the game reserve: it's hardened mercenaries like Royce (experienced cinematic fugitive Adrien Brody) along with murderers, kidnappers, Yakuza, and, er, doctors who are pitted against the crab-faced giants and their horned, toothsome hounds. Robert Rodriguez produces this fifth instalment in the franchise (Hungarian Nimrod Antal directs) and it's a return to the suspenseful, high-velocity form of the original Predator (1987), which gave Arnie one of his proudest pre-gubernatorial moments. It's no masterpiece, but after the cartoonish nadir of Alien vs Predator: Requiem we should be thankful that it's at least as much fun as an episode of Survivor (call it Survivor: Planet Predator). At its heart, it's a Dantean morality tale in which warlike folk of many nations are cast into a purgatory where demons can punish them for their belligerence. Certainly by the time a crazed Laurence Fishburne turns up channelling his Apocalypse Now castmate Marlon Brando, Predators starts looking like the oddest anti-war actioner of the holiday season.

      <review><![CDATA[Wasn’t it only yesterday that Dakota Fanning shrieked her way into your splitting headache in War of the Worlds? She was just 11 back then, and in this fast-and-loose dramatization of the flameout of the 1970s proto-grrrl group, she’s all of 15. Fanning’s costar, vamp bait Kristen Stewart, isn’t that much more experienced (she can vote). The two make for an uncomfortably tarted-up frontline as, respectively, blond yowler Cherie Currie and future-bad-reputation-disregarder Joan Jett. It’s exactly as it should be; the band’s story is a cautionary one. So if you feel yourself getting protective, the movie is doing its job.
The two underage characters meet, naturally, in a bar over drinks, shoved together by creepy L.A. entrepreneur Kim Fowley (Revolutionary Road’s Shannon, the only truly anarchic presence in the whole film). Soon enough, they’re crammed into a motor home with the rest of the band, working on chord ch-ch-changes and sliding inexorably toward drugs, soft-core lesbian sex and Japanese fame. As styled by video director Floria Sigismondi, the film mainly glances on these surfaces—it’s more giggly goofy than coke-in-the-bathroom naughty. (Only vinyl collectors will insist that a serious legacy has been sullied; the plot is as contrived as the group itself.)
So you don’t blink an eye when the prefab wheels run off the rails - there’s very little pathos here for something presumably informed by Currie’s 1989 memoir. Still, you do get a sense of the moment when glam was being fought out in American high schools, and teen sex was barely contained in tight pants. There’s lots of volume in these tunes - the soundtrack is killer—and at least everyone gets their rocks off. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Skin is based on the true story of Sandra Laing (Sophie Okonedo). Born in 1955 during South Africa's Apartheid era, Sandra is the daughter of white Afrikaner parents. However, due to a genetic anomaly, Sandra was born black (many Afrikaner bloodlines contain black genetic material).Sandra's stubborn father, Abraham (Sam Neill), fights the State to get her classified as officially ‘white'. Despite this, the white community refuses to accept her. Sandra eventually finds solace in a black man and elopes with him to Swaziland. Abraham disowns her and forces his wife (Alice Krige) to cut all ties.Anthony Fabian heard Sandra's story ten years ago in a radio interview and was instantly inspired. Knowing very little about South Africa's past, he had to lot to read up on. "This film goes to the heart of every aspect of South African history over the last 60 years and in that sense it was a very big lesson - a PhD in South African history," he says. Making his research a little easier, Fabian was able to sell the publication rights of Sandra's story to Miramax Books. The company hired Judith Stone to write Sandra's biography and she generously shared her findings with Fabian. Laing was also an active consultant on the film. "I think she found it very cathartic and quite therapeutic to see the scenes from her life being acted out and certainly the process of sharing her story with the world has been a very healing one for her," he says. The process of getting the film noticed has been a slow burn though. "Casting was tricky because there are very few black actresses that mean something to financiers and distributors," he recalls. Assuming that it'd be an easier task, Fabian decided to cast the parents first. While there were plenty of name actors to choose from, there were few that were willing to play supporting roles to an unknown African actress in a low budget, independent film. For the role of Sandra, therefore, Fabian needed a name that meant something in the industry. He noticed the UK actress Okonedo, who had been nominated for an Oscar for her part in Hotel Rwanda. Fabian approached her and she committed to the film within weeks of reading the script.The script itself took five years to perfect. For Fabian, the central narrative was about dynamic between Sandra and her parents - the issue of racial discrimination was just a backdrop. "The thing that makes the film most universal is that fact that we all have parents and I think that that cycle of rejection-acceptance that Sandra goes through is something that many of us go through with our families," he explains. Nonetheless, the touchy topic of racism made the film difficult to find distribution for. "A racist subject matter is considered something of a taboo and difficult for people - it takes films like Samson and Delilah to actually break through and prove that there are audiences that are wiling to deal with difficult subjects; subjects that involve non-white people," says Fabian. Fabian persevered and proved the cynics wrong - Skin was one of most popular films during the Perth Film Festival and is now due to open in at least eight Australian cities. It has now won 18 international awards and opened up many doors for the American-born Fabian, who started out as an opera director before moving on to short films and documentaries. "I'm not going to just make films with a message - not just for it to be medicine that's good for you. I want it to be in some way engaging as well," he says. Emily Cheng]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An Australian couple arrives at Calcutta Airport at dawn. Fiona (Radha Mitchell) is a high-flying lawyer; Ben (Joel Edgerton) is a music producer. They're in India to adopt a child, but the process stalls and they're forced to wait in the city for days - obliging them to confront relationship issues that have long lain buried. The debut feature of Sydney director Claire McCarthy, The Waiting City is the first Australian film to be shot entirely in India. It draws upon the director's personal experiences working in Bengali orphanages with her younger sister, Helena. "She believes I owe the whole movie to her," McCarthy laughs. "She was going through a war of attrition with my mum in her last year of high school. Mum said, ‘I cook for you, I clean for you and you're so ungrateful. You'd never survive a day in the slums of Calcutta.' My sister said, ‘yes I would.' My sister rang me and said, ‘Mum's gonna make me go to Calcutta, do you wanna come?'"They arrived in the city in 2002, the elder McCarthy girl bringing a camera to record what they saw, together with her sister's emotional meltdown. "We travelled through the streets and saw bodies sleeping - [Helena] wasn't certain if they were alive or dead. We couldn't find a hotel. She thought she had arrived on the set of a horror film." They eventually settled in and did volunteer work with Mother Teresa's sisters. McCarthy met foreign couples who had travelled to India to collect their adoptive children."The adoption process is not easy," she says. "It's protracted, it's expensive, it's difficult. I do feel the emotional impact that it has on people can really galvanise their relationship or tear them apart."McCarthy, a graduate of the AFTRS, went on to make the documentary Sisters in Calcutta. While shooting the Old Man River music video ‘Sunshine' on the banks of the Ganges, McCarthy revealed to a crew member her idea for a feature film together with her dream star - Radha Mitchell. The story found its way into the Times of India and caught the attention of Mitchell herself, who signed on after reading McCarthy's script.   Casting the role of former rock star Ben was trickier. "Ben had to be a bit of a boy man - not a man's man, but to grow into that through the course of the movie. I always had an eye on Joel and the clincher was when he performed U2's ‘With or Without You' to show that he could sing." The production utilised many of Bollywood's brightest acting and filmmaking talents but perhaps the real star of the movie is Sydney cinematographer Denson Baker. Every frame of The Waiting City is ravishing. "Denson was the year above me at film school so we worked on a few things together. We filmed [The Waiting City] for four months in India and then we decided if we could get through a shoot like that we could get through anything. He's now my husband." But are they going to adopt an Indian child? "We're thinking about it!" Nick Dent

      <review><![CDATA[Don’t expect anything too radical from this infuriatingly soft yet still pleasantly subdued and poignant screen adaptation of Randal Keynes’s book ‘Annie’s Box’, about the emotional traumas suffered by Charles Darwin (Paul Bettany) as he forms the ideas destined for the pages of his magnum opus, ‘On the Origin of Species’. Director Jon Amiel and screenwriter John Collee have gone out of their way not to antagonise either side of the science/religion debate, instead offering a distinctive take on evolutionary theory as refracted through Darwin’s relations with his pious wife (a sour-faced Jennifer Connelly, offering an occasionally hilarious, literal approximation of the Queen’s English) and increasingly curious brood.

In effect reprising his role from Peter Weir’s 2003 swashbuckler Master and Commander, the ever-reliable Bettany plays Darwin as a kindly fusspot who discovers that his austere view of death as an essential cog in the machinery of natural selection has the potential to outrage those who find consolation in an afterlife of clouds, angels and spiritual exoneration. This becomes all the more relevant when his own daughter Annie (likeable newcomer Martha West) is brought down with scarlet fever and he is forced to face the harrowing corollaries of his own theory. With its bijou period trappings and Enya-lite score, it’s easy to dismiss the film as another pat, issue-ducking weepie, but on closer inspection it offers interesting and cohesive musings on the illogical nature of the human character, and how that fits with the responsibilities of scientific discovery. As the title suggests, it’s a film more interested in the birth and nurturing of ideas and their relationship to society than it is in extracting a crude drama from Darwin nervously pressing a knife to God’s throat. In that sense, it succeeds admirably. David Jenkins]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Dream sequences within movies are all too common, and
actually kind of naff. But how do you like dreams-within-dreams - or
dreams-within-dreams-within-dreams? The human mind is a terrifying labyrinth,
or at least Christopher Nolan's is, and the British-born filmmaker has followed
up his gloomy and over-praised Dark Knight with something truly astonishing: a cerebral thriller that asks its audience to
keep track of heart-racing action taking place on four planes of reality,
simultaneously.  Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) works in ‘extractions', stealing
secrets from corporate giants by appearing to them in their slumber. When Saito
(Ken Watanabe) employs Cobb to go the opposite tack and implant a disastrous
business idea in the mind of a rival (Cillian Murphy), the game's afoot and
Cobb assembles a crack team of experts (including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen
Page and Bronson's Tom Hardy) to pull
off the dreamland caper. What they don't count on is a malevolent figure from
Cobb's unconscious (Marion Cotillard) turning up and pulling the rug from under
their illusions.  Nolan has at last made a worthy successor to his mindbending
Memento - a rip-roaring actioner that piles
intellectual conceit upon intellectual conceit, yet remains remarkably lucid
and straightforward. The multiple dreamscapes he brings to the screen include
gasp-inducing CGI images, such as a city giving birth to its mirror twin. But
even more uncanny is his use of real-world tricks like a fist-fight that takes
place in a zero-gravity hotel corridor.  Nolan wields film narrative like a Mozart, a Descartes, or
at least the smartest kid in the chess club. Inception may be two and half hours of car chases, gun fights
and intrigue but, like Memento,
it's also an inquiry into what we really know about life and what it truly
means to ‘wake up'. Ladies and gents, the Oscar race has officially started and
Inception is the one to beat. Nick

      <review><![CDATA[Miranda Otto has brought her star quality to movies including The Lord of the Rings, War of the Worlds, Human Nature and Danny Deckchair. But on the set of her latest and arguably best film, South Solitary, it was a scene-stealing lamb that attracted the most admirers. "Little Bill was the pinup of the shoot," Otto recalls with a laugh. "Everyone was in love with him. In the makeup trailer there were photos of him everywhere."The sight of Otto clutching her woolly co-star opens Shirley Barrett's new movie. It's 1927 and Otto, as Meredith Appleton, a 35-year-old spinster, is accompaniying her lighthouse keeper uncle Wadsworth (played by her father, Barry Otto) to a posting on a remote Southern Ocean island. Wadsworth is appalled by the lack of discipline on the island and sets about making changes. The previous head keeper has shot himself and the lighthouse has since been run by two assistant keepers: George Stanley (Rohan Nichol) and Jack Fleet (Marton Csokas). Fleet is a shellshocked war veteran and keeps to himself. Stanley is married with three children but immediately starts flirting with Meredith. "At the time many of the young men had died at war so there were a lot of women left on their own," Otto explains. "My character is probably thinking that she will most likely never get married. She's someone who's starved of affection; she lost her mother young and got stuck with an uncle who's very strict. And she can have her head turned very easily by a kind word from any gentleman."Barrett wrote the part with Otto in mind, having cast her once before in her debut feature, Love Serenade (1996). A magic realist comedy of two small-town sisters competing for the affections of an oily DJ, Love Serenade won the Camera D'Or in Cannes that year and gave Otto's acting career the boost it needed at the time. "I felt I'd been pigeonholed in things I didn't really like and I was thinking, ‘Do I really want to do acting?' Then I got Love Serenade and it was such a great character it made people look at me differently."For South Solitary, Otto and Barrett collaborated on fleshing out the main character's backstory, combing the Mitchell Library for 1927 photographs and newspapers. "It was wonderful reading the help columns for things like dry hands. We take for granted washing machines these days and forget how much life was a struggle for people. We also started writing letters to each other. Shirley said, ‘I'll pretend to be Meredith's friend, Myra,' and wrote me these hilarious letters and posted them and I'd write back." Otto's stock rose considerably after she played the heroic Eowyn in two Lord of the Rings movies and three years ago she was cast as the lead in a Sex and the City/Desperate Housewives hybrid called Cashmere Mafia. Then the Hollywood writers' strike came down and the show was cancelled after only seven episodes. "I would have loved to have done it a bit longer," she says. "It was a pleasure to work on stories about women and I miss the fact there isn't anything like that on television any more."In 2005 she had a daughter, Darcey, with husband Peter O'Brien, and has focused on making films in Australia including Blessed and In Her Skin. Otto has never won an AFI award, but that's a situation that South Solitary should remedy. Not only does she get some heart-rending scenes, it's a showcase for her skill at understated comedy. Otto, however, is quick to channel praise to the film's writer-director. "Shirley's writing is so funny and she has an original viewpoint on things. Just when you think things are about to get sentimental she'll have something really odd and funny happen." Nick Dent]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Last year, Amy Adams whined her way through Julie &amp; Julia as a modern-day food blogger, when all we really hungered for was more of Meryl Streep’s magically right Julia Child. So take the title of Me and Orson Welles as a slight warning. Yes, the Citizen Kane director figures prominently - and gloriously - in this 1937-set theatrical backstage drama. But in the spotlight, there’s a blandly eager high-schooler (Efron, unable to penetrate the cute), who’s conscripted into the zesty goings-on. Would someone please drag him offstage already? There’s a rising star in the wings.
Britain’s Christian McKay has already played Welles to great acclaim Off Broadway; his impersonation here is nothing short of astounding. Just to be totally clear, this is not the sprawling Mount Orson of the director’s latter years (or even of Touch of Evil). It’s the young phenom who terrorized the radio waves, tore around Manhattan in an ambulance and chased skirt on his way to Shakespearean glory. McKay effortlessly captures the man’s arrogance, sparring with tireless producer John Houseman (Happy-Go-Lucky’s fuming Marsan), but he’s even better with Welles’s sly invitation of a wink, drawing all to his bidding, happily. The voice is uncanny too.
Me and Orson Welles preoccupies itself with some romantic tussles - nice enough, but nothing on McKay’s dynamic moments of ego. Maybe this is a good time to mention that the director is Richard Linklater, usually a lot more versatile. Try to imagine a version of Linklater’s School of Rock that didn’t pivot on the manic music teacher played by Jack Black but instead, perhaps, on his boring roommate. That’s what you have here. Had Welles been in charge, there’d be no contest.  Joshua Rothkopf
Preview:Orson Welles's revolutionary 1937 stage adaptation of Julius Caesar famously relocated Shakespeare's play to a fascist context. Of course,
while it was in rehearsals, no one would have known how influential the
production would become.Enter director Richard Linklater's Me and Orson Welles.
Adapted from a novel by Robert Kaplow, the film views the playmaking
process through the eyes of a fictitious bit player, Richard (Zac
Efron), who has brushes with love (with Claire Danes) and genius (in
the form of Welles, played by uncanny newcomer Christian McKay) as the
show comes together. The way Linklater sees it, the movie shouldn't be
seen as just Richard's coming-of-age story. "I also consider it a
Welles coming-of-age movie, because he's only 22," the director
explains. "This is his first Mercury Theatre production. Although he's
had plenty of success already at his young age, he really is still
discovering who he is, who he's going to be, who he wants to be."The
Welles brand may be as much a hindrance as a help. When the film
premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival, a colleague
speculated that distributors wouldn't touch it because of the "curse of
Orson Welles." (The filmmaking polymath had more than his share of
butchered Hollywood projects.) It will have been almost two years between the Toronto world premiere and the day Me and Orson Welles finally sees Australian theaters, but Linklater says the delay had less to do with
skittishness surrounding the Welles mystique than the fact that the
film wasn't quite completed when it first played. At Toronto, it was
projected digitally without a final sound mix, so between finishing the
movie and getting it picked up for distribution, "it might have taken
that year anyway," Linklater says. Plus, he adds, "[Any Welles] curse
probably just existed during his lifetime - I think Orson only grows with
each generation."Let's hope that's true, because Me and Orson Welles is a grand backstage crowd-pleaser that, as Linklater suggested when he
introduced the first Toronto screening, celebrates the joy of theatre.
It's also, more subtly, a movie about hindsight and regret."A
lot of those guys who worked with Welles then - I think as even Norman
Lloyd [who played Cinna the poet in Welles's production] said - didn't
totally appreciate that at the time," Linklater says. "[He assumed]
there [would] always be a guy like Orson Welles [to work for]... At 23,
he didn't really appreciate what was happening right in front of him."A
major part of the challenge, of course, was casting a convincing
Welles, and Linklater found one in McKay, a British actor who'd starred
in his own one-man Welles show. "The magic of Christian was that he's
an unknown," Linklater says. "You're not going, ‘Leonardo DiCaprio's
doing a pretty good Welles.'"The Welles of 1937 was Welles before Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, Touch of Evil and Chimes at Midnight - and even before his landmark radio-play version of War of the Worlds.
"There might be [a possibility for] another movie about Welles's time at the Gate Theatre in Dublin or something, but this
seems to be the earliest depiction of him," Linklater says. "We all
know what comes soon after and much later, and everyone has their own
theories, opinions and all that, but it was just kind of fun to deal
with young Mr Welles."The focus on the collaborative process of
Welles's early years returns Linklater to the theme of one of his most
popular films. "In School of Rock,
I wanted to show how fun it might look to be in a band," Linklater
says. "What I liked in both these movies is that it was really about
the process - being part of an artistic troupe... That's what films are.
They're constantly in the state of becoming until the very end." Ben Kenigsberg]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In an interview at Cannes, Stone said he hoped viewers would keep an open mind about Hugo Chávez, but if there’s one thing South of the Border demonstrates conclusively, it’s that Stone’s mind was made up before he boarded the plane. The most charitable way to look at this documentary—in which the director tours South America and lobs softball questions at half a dozen national leaders for what appears to be an afternoon each - is as a straightforward, uncomplicated corrective to the shrill propaganda of Fox News. A real corrective might have upped the sophistication level - Stone makes a convincing case for Chávez’s teddy-bear side, but is he really not even going to ask him about Ahmadinejad or accusations of suppressing dissent? - but sophistication is not a stock in trade for the man who made Natural Born Killers.
Stone’s broadly provocative argument is that the last decade’s wave of populism in South America is actually closer to true democracy than what we have, where corporate interests dominate political decisions. (His sole serious line of questioning involves how much each country owes to the IMF.) It’s a proposition well worth considering during indulgent cutaways to Stone munching on coca leaves, listening to Bolivia’s Evo Morales regale him with Wiki-facts. South of the Border is far more fascinating for its filmmaker’s personality than for anything it reveals. Ben Kenigsberg]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Returning to the swirling camerawork, hallucinatory sense of real time and narrative maelstrom of sex, drugs and death that characterised his last feature, Irréversible (2002), Noé strives for greatness and even more notoriety with this epic, wild folly that transplants the same methods to modern Tokyo and its seedy expat scene. This is first-person cinema: we start in the head of Oscar (Brown), a young American living the backstreet life and whose blinking offers Noé a handy device for hiding his end-of-scene cuts. Not long into the film, Oscar, whose sister Linda (Huerta) has recently arrived from the US for a visit, suddenly dies while smoking the potent drug DMT. Noé’s camera then takes its cue from a handily placed copy of The Tibetan Book of the Dead and floats above his body for the rest of the film: this is truly soulful film-making. The camera hovers for the next two hours, taking ones patience to the edge of madness, darting in and out of buildings, visiting Oscar’s troubled childhood, creepily lapping up his sister’s naked body, revealing the after-effects of his death, and even embarking on an episode of reincarnation. Or, you wonder, is this just a bad drugs trip that Noé is trying to recreate? That would, at least, explain the frequent recourse to digitally animated spirals, fractals and other druggy patterns.

      <name><![CDATA[American: The Bill Hicks Story]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[Since his passing in 1994, the image of maverick US comedian Bill Hicks has been adopted as a crude totem that equates chain-smoking and invective with a vague, post-punk defiance. As this exhaustive, moving documentary confirms, not only did Hicks’s fiery, ultra-articulate belligerence make him a rebel with a cause but he carried with him a permanent sadness relating to how his comedy was received and the state of the world. Painstakingly recreating the testimony of friends and family by manipulating and animating archive photographs, the directors tell Hicks’s story in a clear, linear fashion and never push for undue meaning.

The breadth and quality of the archive is nothing short of astounding – there’s even grainy VHS footage of his endless tours through dives such as The Comedy Pouch in Possum Ridge, Arkansas – so even those who shrug at his combative style of humour won’t be able to deny that this is a model of detailed and distanced biographical filmmaking.

      <review><![CDATA[Imagine if you salvaged a grubby VHS tape off  the roadside only to discover it contained outtakes from an amateur ‘Jackass’ knock-off. That’s what the new ‘movie’ from scurrilous trash-art guru Harmony Korine feels like. It’s an interminable montage of bin-based horseplay, appliance smashing, high-pitched yowling and affected bad taste that’s fully aware of its own wilful derangement. Plus, it’s all carried out by four actors (including Korine and his wife, Rachel) wearing prosthetic OAP masks and gaudy dimestore threads. With its free-associative style and scuzzy VHS aesthetic, the film suggests Korine is trying to recapture the scintillating Southern-gothic poetry of Gummo, his sublime 1998 debut, while casting off the glossy production-value shackles of his lacklustre 2007 film Mister Lonely – but he only succeeds in bastardising the style of the former while achieving the low quality of the latter. Of course, there will be a core nucleus of hardened Korinites who will happily cheer along with every pelvic thrust, but for everyone else, this is a puerile and bafflingly hollow work.

      <review><![CDATA["We looked at it and thought 'What the hell are we going to do? Why did we agree to do this?'"
What could possibly have Quan Yeomans, frontman for veteran Aussie rockers Regurgitator, so shook up? Nothing more than a new music score for one of the most popular anime movies of all time, Akira. Of course, it all came down to fandom in the end: "Ben, Peter and I love the original film, and the soundtrack is incredible."
For those unfamiliar with the movie,Akira tells the tale of two gang members dealing with psychic powers and government troops in the post-apocalyptic city of Neo-Tokyo. The film will screen at the Opera 
House as part of the Graphic Festival with the new music performed live on the night by the 'Gurge. "[Performing the soundtrack live] was something we realised we had to do. It's interesting, because you’re locked into a set 
visual piece so you have to be very accurate. We're still working on the logistics. When we first started we thought 'we're fine!', but it’s really intense."
Of course, it's all grist for the mill for the trio. "It’s been interesting doing the soundtrack because we’re recording as well on the weekends, doing a quick EP. For later down the track when we’re doing a record at the end of the year, this experience will really influence us. 
"There’s a couple of weird songs that I’m not sure about, and a couple of pop-punk songs, and hardcore songs, and some repetitive art-rock 
songs, so it's a mixed bag. This is just so we have something to tour on in September." Jonathon Valenzuela]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The release date for Jonah Hex is now unconfirmed. Watch this space.All three of you clamoring for a sequel to Wild Wild West have got your wish: Jonah Hex - an adaptation of the DC Comics series about a Western antihero with otherworldly abilities - gives that Fresh Prince-starring disaster from 1999 a run for its wasted money. Occupying a similarly alternate 19th-century universe, Hex (Brolin) is a horribly scarred bounty hunter out for the blood of the man who murdered his family, Quentin Turnbull (Malkovich). But it’s not simply a matter of revenge, since Turnbull has a monomaniacal plan to use an Eli Whitney-invented weapon of mass destruction (a cannonball-hurling side project to that silly ol’ cotton gin) against President Ulysses S. Grant (Aidan Quinn).
What’s a guy who can interrogate the dead to do? Fuck Megan Fox, of course. Then it’s off on a nonsensical progression of adventures that reach their apex when a handy group of Indians - sort of the AAA roadside assistance for the recently deceased - brings Hex back from the beyond. He inhales some digital smoke, coughs up a crow and shouts a Shatneresque “Turnbull!!!” And then? Howzabout a rushed steamboat-of-death finale involving the plastic-bag-loving videographer from American Beauty, Colonel Daniels from The Wire and Gob Bluth from Arrested Development? But by that point you’ll hopefully be passed out from all the pocket-flask shots you’ve swigged to survive this hex of a flick. Keith Uhlich]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[The Ghost Writer]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[We’re so used to amped-up white-knucklers that the controlled approach of a filmmaker like Roman Polanski is immediately seductive. The director responsible for such mainstays as Chinatown and Rosemary’s Baby (and of course his own real-life news cycle) turns Robert Harris’s political potboiler involving a ghostwriter (McGregor), a former British prime minister (Brosnan) and an isolated island home into a slow-burn near-masterpiece. Shot in claustrophobic widescreen, the film showcases Polanski’s mastery of even expository scenes: A revealing conversation between McGregor’s so-called ghost and a shady figure played by Tom Wilkinson is so fraught with tension that you expect those malevolent Cocteau-esque hands from Repulsion to burst out of the wall and drag someone into oblivion.
The film stays more grounded than that, though it certainly doesn’t lack for perverse Polanski flourishes. There’s a great bit of carnal business with the prime minister’s wife (Williams) that’s filmed in a deadpan long shot. Eli Wallach pops up—frail-looking though spirited—as an old-timer who stokes the writer’s paranoia about his employer’s plans for him. And more than one character has a wry aside on the protagonist’s heritage (“Oh, you Brits!”), as if it was both a badge of honor and a reason for condescending suspicion.
There are all number of similarly colorful touches (the sick-joke ending alone is worth the price of admission) that help to deepen what one colleague suggested is the greatest airport novel ever filmed. It’s true that The Ghost Writer doesn’t possess the lingering profundity of the director’s best work—the War on Terror window dressing is just that. Yet Polanski has made a genre piece with a verve and vitality that’s in sadly short supply. Keith Uhlich]]></review>

    <version lang="en">
      <name><![CDATA[Scott Pilgrim vs The World]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[The first thing that springs to mind when viewing Scott Pilgrim vs The World is that
director Edgar Wright is a genius. Never before has a comic book been so
gracefully transferred to the big screen than in his latest effort, based on
the series of graphic novels by Bryan Lee O'Malley. The title character is a hipster
heartbreaker who meets the girl of his dreams and in order to be with her  must defeat her seven evil exes in combat. Even if you aren't familiar
with the source material, the movie lays everything out quickly and you never
feel like you are missing out on anything.Wright's success on this film comes from meeting his stylistic references on their
own territory: onomatopoeic words accompany sound effects just like in comic
books; videogame powerups float around in 8-bit glory; and martial arts battles
climax in eye-shattering visuals reminiscent of anime. Clever direction and
editing give the movie the feel of actually reading the comics themselves, with
scenes flowing and blending like comic panels and great physical comedy adding
a hint of classic cartoons to the mix. The casting is flawless. As Scott, Michael
Cera finally gets to showcase a wider range of talent than his usual ‘simpering
teen' role. He is excellent, not only capturing the humourous, vunerable side of
his character, but also playing a mightily convincing hero. Mary Elizabeth
Winstead is both charming and mysterious as Scott's object of desire, and Jason
Schwartzman gleefully chomps the scenery as the main villain Gideon. Special
mentions have to go to Kieran Culkin as Scott's wry, gay roommate Wallace and Aubrey Plaza
as the foul-mouthed social busybody Julie Powers. With a tight, hilarious script, excellent special effects, brilliant cultural references and a story that marries romance and action perfectly, Scott Pilgrim is
potentially the most fun movie to come out this year – a kinetic epic that both
stands for and gently lampoons the generation it came from. Superheroes should be so lucky to get this treatment. Jonathon Valenzuela]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When you take away a man's job you take away his pride. Take
away a man's job but force him to show up to work anyway, and you have a recipe
for disaster. New Oz flick The Nothing Men explores what happens when six
workers who are soon to be made redundant have to wait out weeks with nothing
to do on an empty factory floor. Their anxious wait is inflamed when a worker from a
different factory, David (David Field), is transferred to theirs. Foreman Jack
(Colin Friels) suspects the interloper is a spy for the parent company. If
workers break the rules or leave the factory during work hours they can be
dismissed and lose their redundancy cheques. Jack and his coworkers have been spending the time drinking
beer and playing poker, both of which are against regulations, so they're
considerably resentful of the new guy, who's irritatingly polite into the
bargain.  The only worker who likes him is Wesley (Martin Dingle-Wall),
who engages David in games of chess, but whose murky past contains a secret
that will bring about a devastating series of events. The Nothing Men is the debut feature of Mark Fitzpatrick and
based on his play of the same name. It's now showing at Hoyts Broadway and Randwick Ritz (for one week only).]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Marisa (Jacinda Barrett) is having a lousy week. No sooner is her young son Jack (Tom Russell) diagnosed with leukemia than she discovers that her husband (Richard Roxburgh) is a serial philanderer. While Jack befriends another leukemia sufferer (Kodi Smit-McPhee) Marisa becomes close to his Irish father (James Nesbitt). Matching Jack is a romantic tearjerker about illness, infidelity and silver linings. Veteran Aussie director Nadia Tass explains the making of her first local film (with partner David Parker) in 13 years.What was the inspiration for this film?This was inspired by a number of true stories. Lynne Renew wrote the original script and it was just a very strong, emotional story. The idea that a child's life might be saved through his father's infidelity was just so original and so loaded that we were immediately pretty keen on doing it.Getting the tone of this film right must have been difficult? When we first read the script ten years ago, tonally it was different. We added more humour. I think David and I are pretty much known for taking serious subject matter and couching it in humour.  Jacinda Barrett is an Australian actress but this is her first Australian film...I had Jacinda on my radar from a long time ago. The audience is actually going to believe that Jacinda Barrett is actually Marisa Hagen, because even though Jacinda has been in Bridget Jones's Diary and Ladder 49 and The Last Kiss and all of that, she actually isn't a recognisable face to that degree that it's going to colour their perception of the character. What made you choose Kodi Smit-McPhee, James Nesbitt and Richard Roxburgh? It was about three years before we shot it that we started talking to Kodi and Kodi's father. I had to have Kodi play Finn. He's such a wonderful actor. And Jimmy [Nesbitt] read the script five years before we shot it and said yes right away and stuck with us through all the vagaries of the financing process. I was thrilled that he wanted to come on board. Richard [Roxburgh] was kind of late into it. It was actually a really rough role to cast because he begins as the bad guy and we needed to make that character very human and not just see him of a caricature of the all bad guys out there who were screwing around. I didn't want to go there and neither did Richard.Is it true you re-mortgaged your house to help finance it?Yeah that's true! It's more than a decade since you've made a film in Australia, right?Yeah and I really wanted to come home. I felt this film would sit so much better in Melbourne. We did talk about Seattle.  You've made a couple of TV films with Julia Roberts' production company in the States. How did that come about?She approached us. She saw Amy (1997). That's flattering.Yeah, it was good, because it meant we did the first two for her and that was setting the tone for the subsequent films that were going to be made and it's good. There's been constant work in America for us. Gaynor Flynn]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Recent news about unmasked Russian sleeper agents in New York City might have lent the new paranoid action thriller Salt a kind of currency, but this story of nasty
Russians trying to start a global war is a mouldy slice of Reagan-era baloney.
Angelina Jolie is Evelyn Salt, a CIA operative on the run
after being fingered by a defecting Russian agent as one of their own. Is she
an innocent fugitive or an enemy of the state? Her CIA colleagues (Liev
Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor) can't decide, but as Salt escapes from one
hopeless situation after another it becomes clear that she's on her way to a
funeral to be attended by both the US and Russian presidents - and she's armed to the
teeth. Australia's Phillip Noyce directs Kurt Wimmer's script, which rockets along with chase
sequences and confounds with double-crosses but can't hide its essentially
facile nature. As for Jolie, she spends the film wearing an
I'm-pretty-and-I've-got-a-secret smirk that would mark her out as suspicious in a
crowd of thousands. To her credit, though, she gamely leaps off trucks, slams into walls and jumps out of a choppers. She – and a couple of dozen female stunt doubles – must be nursing a lot of bruises. Nick

      <review><![CDATA[Ahead of its Sydney premiere, we caught up with Kayvan Novak, one of the stars of Chris Morris's controversial comedy about four hapless jihadis.Welcome to Sydney. Have you been seeing the sights? We took a boat to Watsons Bay. We went on a walk
past the male nudist beach, to the lighthouse and back again.
  Interesting choice. Were there any male nudists there? Oh, there were – there was a congregation on one
side of five nude males. I think they had been camping. Not like that.
Actually, yes – like that. But they also had a tent.   In other news, how did you get involved with Four
Lions? The usual. Agent:
"Do you want to meet [co-writer/director] Chris Morris? He's doing a film about suicide bombers."
"Yes please!" Met him in a café, had a chat, he gave me some DVDs of
Asian lads from the north of England and said: "Look at this guy in particular. Give me the accent." I
gave him an accent. He was like, "Try harder." I got the part over the course
of a year. When you first read the Four Lions script and realised it was a comedy about jihadi
suicide bombers, what did you think? I thought: "I've got so many
lines. Wicked! This is awesome." No, I did think seriously about it. I don't think I would have done it with anyone else apart from Chris.
It's really about trusting him and trusting that he knew what he was doing. And
he did.
Did you worry about how certain people might react if
they thought you were mocking Islamic fundamentalists? Did you
think you might have had to go into hiding? Yeah,
there was a lot of that at the beginning where people would initially go: "Hmm:
suicide bombers. Comedy. What's funny about that?" It's a film ultimately. It's
trying to break that fear factor down really, by extracting humour from a
potentially humourless subject. The film will surprise a few people with just how far it
pushes the envelope... That's the beauty of the film – it kind of tickles you and
then kicks you in the balls at a certain point. And then kicks you again,
harder. That reaction is quite common, where people find it really funny, but
also really moving. Several times the film makes you laugh out loud, but then a couple
of seconds later you get laugher's remorse where you suddenly realise what
you're laughing at. Presumably that kind of discomfort is entirely deliberate? Yeah, not many films take you
there. That's the skill of Chris really. Dan Rookwood]]></review>
