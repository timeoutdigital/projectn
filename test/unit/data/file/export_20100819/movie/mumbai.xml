      <review><![CDATA[Knight and Day is an action movie of the old school before everything was about massive digital battles royal. Superspy Tom Cruise fends off trained assassins without ever losing his trademark grin. Cameron Diaz is the innocent bystander swept up into his world of international intrigue when he uses her to get something past airport customs. They careen from Kansas to Boston to Switzerland to Spain with Central Intelligence Agency agents who think he’s gone rogue in hot pursuit. Between the magical cell phones that can deactivate car alarms, the surviving of an airliner crash in a cornfield and the astonishingly bad aim of the machine-gun-wielding baddies, this is a film that asks us to skip past suspending disbelief and go straight to expulsion.It’s a measure of how lumbering action movies have been of late that this works at all. Cruise’s weird mix of earnest concern and roguish flirtation gives his character an amusing topspin. Diaz does what she can, but she’s asked to be both a resourceful, classic-car-fixin’ mechanic and the screaming girl of so many action movies. There are some inspired moments thrown in amid all the running and shooting, but they feel like truffle shavings on a Big Mac. - Hank Sartin]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA["What a difference a decade makes. The last time M Night Shyamalan tried to form a franchise, he made the idiosyncratic and relatively unpopular superhero story Unbreakable (2000). His adaptation of the popular Nickelodeon animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender  plays like a rejoinder to that film’s perceived flaws, which means that it’s been leeched of all personality and given a hack-blockbuster burnish. Any computer could have directed this mythological mishmash about a reincarnated boy named Aang (Noah Ringer) and his fairy-tale quest to master the sorta-martial art called bending. Just strike a lot of fancy, Far East-flavoured poses, and control over the four elements – earth, air, fire and water – is yours.
It’s a hell of a party trick, though Shyamalan visualises Aang’s otherworldly powers with dull detachment. The camera swoops and the music blares, but we might as well be watching a tolerant parent filming his son’s karate class demonstration. Only Slumdog Millionaire’s Dev Patel, as the bastard prince of the villainous Fire nation, truly gets jiggy with the fantasy. A cliff-hanger ending, meanwhile, portends a series of sequels (this is but “Book One”). I smell another Golden Compass]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Early on in I Hate Luv Storys, Sammir Soni, who plays a filmmaker, says that his upcoming movie is “not a love story, it’s a saga”. So in life. I Hate Luv Storys stretches on and on and, despite its best intentions, says nothing new about Bollywood’s treatment of love and relationships. Director Punit Malhotra’s debut film pretends to mock Bollywood’s formulaic and fluffy romances, but the movie ultimately confirms the power of mush. Cocky and cynical assistant director J (Imran Khan) despises the way Hindi movies depict romance. But he meets his match in Simran (Sonam Kapoor), a production designer who fervently believes that reel love is real. Like in any filmi story, J and Simran initially argue a lot but become fast friends. Simran mistakes their closeness for love. J blames her obsession with the movies for the awkward turn of events. Malhotra, who also wrote the screenplay and dialogue, manages to draw some laughs by spoofing hit romances such as Dilwale Dulhania Le Jaayenge, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (directed by I Hate Luv Storys producer Karan Johar), Dil Chahta Hai and Hum Tum. However, it doesn’t take long for the comedy bits to go off the rails, while the dramatic scenes fall flat in the second half. The attractive-looking lead pair have a charming screen presence and their repartee will amuse young viewers, but little else memorable transpires between them. Imran Khan gets some good lines but isn’t convincing as a womaniser. Kapoor does little more than flash toothy smiles. If Malhotra had focused as much on the script as on the sets and the wardrobe, this love story might have been more worthwhile. - Suhani Singh]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[“Bella, they're not even alive,” Jacob (Taylor Lautner) whimpers when he learns his improbable love interest (KristenStewart) has once again forsaken him and his lupine clan for the dependable lapdog of the undead (Robert Pattinson), and to the extent that The Twilight Saga: Eclipse is more tolerable than its predecessors, it is for giving its mannequins a semblance of anger and disappointment. Or maybe this time, the actors have just been directed to look interested. Clearly, Jacob of the congenital shirtlessness and Edward of the vacant stare can’t both have their way with Bella of the eternal pout, and as they size each other up in a freezing tent – with Edward spiteful over Jacob’s ability to keep Bella warm – there is the sense that Eclipse is good campy fun, or at least fodder for theorists and werewolf therapists.Director David Slade varies the pace and the rhythm a bit, knowing that when you’re stuck with two exasperatingly dull (and chaste) main characters, the best thing to do is to get away from them whenever possible. Eclipse rouses from its photo-shoot torpor during brief flashbacks to the Civil War and the 1930s; material involving the supporting cast (including an underused Bryce Dallas Howard) suggests Slade as a passing student of Kathryn Bigelow’s Near Dark. But Stephenie Meyer’s mythology is too thin to withstand the ponderous approach borrowed from adaptations of JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis, and its heroine’s appeal is never even established, let alone timeless]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[No one’s coming to a big-screen version of the lunkheaded American television show expecting The Hurt Locker. But would it have killed the editors to let a single shot breathe for more than two seconds? Diced into hash, the action sequences are unusually painful: poundingly loud and punctuated by Liam Neeson’s bark, Bradley Cooper’s manic heehawing and a total lack of clarity. Does it matter if the elite squad is squaring off against some shady CIA tools and mercenaries? The smidgen of topicality is buried under tons of noise. - Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Jon Harris says his routine sequel is a “seamless continuation” of Neil Marshall's heart-stopping survival horror movie, in which six female friends were attacked in an Appalachian cave system by mutant, flesh-eating monsters. Traumatised, amnesiac survivor Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) is ordered back underground by a sceptical local sheriff and sets off with the lawman, his female deputy and a three-person rescue team. The first hint of what happened to the five missing women is glimpsed on a video camera's playback; then the party is attacked by a new breed of ferocious crawlers. Simon Bowles’s subterranean sets and Sam McCurdy’s stygian cinematography create a suitably terrifying atmosphere, but ex-editor Jon Harris’s direction is messy, favouring confusing set-piece scares over the all-important group dynamics. Also, the opportunistic resurrection of the (presumed) dead Juno (Natalie Mendoza) is lazy and insulting, and the abrupt, nihilistic ending is in no way earned. - Nigel Floyd]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[We may have moved from veiled Cold War to explicit global terror in the 25 years since the excellent, UK-set nuclear conspiracy thriller Edge of Darkness first aired on the BBC, directed by Martin Campbell (Casino Royale) and written by Troy Kennedy Martin. It’s also been some eight, traumatic post-9/11 years since Mel Gibson’s last thespian outing in M Night Shyamalan’s Signs. But time seems to have stood still in Campbell’s drab remake for the big screen. In condensing the original mini-series into a conventional, two-hour package, scriptwriters William Monahan and Andrew Bovell have sadly sacrificed some of the original’s cultural specificity and its slow-burn quality. Craven (Mel Gibson), the widowed police officer whose engineer daughter (Bojana Novakovic) is gunned down on a home visit, is now one of the Boston police department’s finest. Gibson recalls the earnest intensity and investigative zeal of Bob Peck’s original performance, but he also brings a lot of unwanted manic mannerisms to the part. - Wally Hammond]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Let the record note that the martial art performed in this film is in fact kung fu. Karate is a Japanese discipline, which was fine for the 1984 original, with Noriyuki “Pat” Morita teaching Ralph Macchio the ways of karate. The 2010 reboot moves the action to China, which makes sense with star Jackie Chan as a new master and affords the opportunity for much scenic tourism. But The Kung-Fu Kid doesn’t have brand-name recognition, so The Karate Kid this film remains.The new version also skews younger with Jaden Smith as Dre, whose mother (Taraji P Henson, underutilised) has moved them from Detroit to China for a job in an auto factory (The idea that China is importing American auto-industry employees is a canard that must be discreetly overlooked under the “suspension of disbelief” audience-movie accords). It’s more plausible that a kid of 12 is the victim of bullying, though it does give the romantic pairing with a cute classmate (Wenwen Han) a bit of an icky too-young feeling. The movie remains a pretty painless piece of family entertainment, tapping into the primal urge to show up your oppressors in single combat. -  Hank Sartin]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The latest comic book to get a Hollywood going-over, The Losers is a growling, paranoid graphic novel about a renegade military unit transformed into a 12-certificate bro-out. Plugging into the zeitgeist for films about dark forces pulling strings in government, it opens with the unit carrying out covert black ops. They’re in Bolivia to do the CIA’s bidding, taking out a drugs baron. Only when they arrive, the baron is using children as mules. Their handler, Max – the puppet master orders them to strike regardless. Refusing, they come under attack from their own side, and presumed dead, disappear off into hiding promising payback. All the usual soldierly suspects are here: motormouth geek, family man, taciturn shooter, the really hard one – played perfectly decently by Chris Evans, Columbus Short, Oscar Jaenada and Idris Elba, with Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the colonel. There’s even a hot chick, Zoë Saldana, who handles weapons like a trooper, sometimes in her knickers. - Cath Clarke]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[After the family patriarch is paralysed by a stroke, the powerful Pratap clan is split down the middle. On one side is Prithvi (Arjun Rampal), more Sonny Corleone than Yudhishtra, and his brother Samar (Ranbir Kapoor), the movie’s Arjun/Michael Corleone. Brij Mohan (Nana Patekar) is Krishna, Samar’s sensei in statecraft. On the other side is Virendra or Duryodhana (Manoj Bajpai), who seeks revenge for being denied what he believes is his rightful share of the legacy. Virendra’slieutenant is Suraj (Ajay Devgn), a Dalit leader modelled on Karna. Anybody with even a cursory knowledge of the Mahabharata and The Godfather will knows what happens next. Samar, who is studying for a PhD in nineteenth-century poetry, morphs into a master strategist to save his brother’s political career. There are no friends, only allies in this morally empty world. Samar exploits his childhood acquaintance Indu (Katrina Kaif) to secure her wealthy father’s financial backing. The secret of Suraj’s birth – he’s the illegitimate son of the mother (Nikhila Trikha) of Samar and Prithvi – becomes a bargaining chip.  Samar is cruel and manipulative, but he is played by Ranbir Kapoor, so he must be an unlikely hero. - Nandini Ramnath]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Outlaw Beera (Abhishek Bachchan) kidnaps Ragini (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) and spirits her away to his gorgeous jungle lair. Ragini’s husband Dev (Vikram), a superintendent of police, follows in hot pursuit. Taking visual cues from Akira Kurosawa’s samurai-themed films, Francis Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now and Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Ratnam and his cinematographers (V Manikandan and Santosh Sivan) burrow deep into a rain-soaked forest that is a metaphorical refuge from the law and the strictures of society. Beera has something of a back story – he is seeking revenge for the gang-rape by policemen of his half-sister Jamuniya (Priyamani), which drove her to commit suicide. However, Beera is a mostly blank screen onto which Ratnam projects one of his pet themes: the celebration of the anti-hero. Beera’s rage against the system makes even more sense in the Tamil version, which refers to age-old caste tensions in Tamil Nadu. (Ratnam made two versions of the film, with Vikram playing Beera in the Tamil one.) While Ratnam’s fluid story-telling style is in full flow in the Tamil version, he seems adrift with an unfamiliar language and a cast in Raavan. The Hindi movie is much weaker than the Tamil version, which is powered by a mesmeric performance by Vikram.  Bachchan, in contrast, overacts furiously and treats the whole thing as one big joke. -  Nandini Ramnath]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Sunnyside, the day-care centre where the delightful new Toy Story occurs, might be a paradise – especially for Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz (voiced by Tim Allen) and a gang facing obsolescence. (Andy is off to college and his mom has broken out the Hefty bags.) But in the sternly orotund warning of one Mr Pricklepants (ex-Bond Timothy Dalton), it’s “a place of ruin and despair”, peopled with violent, drooling tykes and ruled with a plush fist by Lots-o’-Huggin’ Bear (voiced by the extraordinary Ned Beatty), whose strawberry scent and harmonica-swaddled folksiness hide a sadist.Clearly, Pixar’s genius for adventurous storytelling continues unabated. As always, the fun with this franchise comes from elaborate sequences of escape, stressing the plastic, resourceful nature of our heroes. - Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Alfred Hitchcock’s sleek, wry, paranoid 1959 thriller caught the zeitgeist perfectly: Cold War shadiness, secret agents of power, urbane modernism, the ant-like bustle of city life, and a hint of dread behind the sharp suits of affluence. Cary Grant’s Roger Thornhill is the film’s sharply dressed ad exec who is sucked into a vortex of mistaken identity. Hitchcock breezes through a tongue-in-cheek, nightmarish plot with a lightness of touch that’s equalled by a charming performance from Grant, who copes effortlessly with the script’s dash between claustrophobia and intrigue on one hand and romance and comedy on the other.

      <review><![CDATA[Based on the Reverend Thomas Dixon Jr’s deliriously racist The Clansman, a melodramatic novel about the American Civil War and its aftermath, DW Griffith’s 1915 film is remarkable for its technical innovations and for the truly epic feel created by the carefully orchestrated, swirling masses of figures in the battle scenes. It’s also remarkable for having had no written scenario, costumes that were made by actor Lillian Gish’s mother, battle scenes that were shot in a day, and a cost that meant Griffith had nothing left but the shirt on his back. The biggest challenge the film provided for its audiences is perhaps to decide when “ground-breaking, dedicated, serious cinematic art” must be reviled as politically reprehensible.

      <review><![CDATA[Bruno Bonomo (Silvio Orlando), a flailing producer of B-movies, reluctantly agrees to back a cinematic attack on Silvio Berlusconi when young writer-director Teresa (Jasmine Trinca) thrusts her script into his hands. It’s only when he begins the soul-destroying process of finding financiers and actors that he warms a little to Teresa’s cause. His mild awakening is superceded by a personal crisis: not only is his career in tatters, but he and his wife (Margherita Buy) are separating. As he struggles to balance family and work, we see some imagined scenes from his Berlusconi film, each reflecting a different stage in its production and each showing Berlusconi played by a different actor, including director Nanni Moretti himself. Moretti’s portrait of a loser lingering in the doldrums of Italian cinema is wittily scripted and lightly played.

      <review><![CDATA[Santosh Sivan’s Before the Rains is a solid if unmemorable slice of culture-clash melodrama. Revisiting timeworn Merchant Ivory themes – forbidden love, cultural displacement and colonial misadventure – the film attempts to reflect the wider imperial conflict through a tightly focused story of one village and its strained relationship with its British overseers. Linus Roache is understretched in the role of Moores, a spice planter locked in a turbulent affair with his housegirl (Nandita Das). The more showy role goes to Rahul Bose as his disapproving manservant, TK, whose knowledge of his master’s indiscretions leads him into an ideological struggle between friendship and national identity. The film’s main strength lies in the relationships between its characters – each make terrible but understandable decisions that lead to tragedy, but none ever appears as an outright villain. Only towards the end does this careful balance become unstuck, leading to a contrived finalé that wraps up the story without offering any satisfying emotional conclusions. - Tom Huddleston.

      <review><![CDATA["All three of you clamouring for a sequel to Wild Wild West have got your wish. Jonah Hex, an adaptation of the DC Comics series about a Western antihero with otherworldly abilities, gives that Fresh Prince-starring disaster from 1999 a run for its wasted money. Occupying a similarly alternate nineteenth-century universe, Hex (Josh Brolin) is a horribly scarred bounty hunter out for the blood of the man who murdered his family, Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich). But it’s not simply a matter of revenge, since Turnbull has a monomaniacal plan to use a weapon of mass destruction against President Ulysses S Grant (Aidan Quinn).
What’s a guy who can interrogate the dead to do? Sleep with Megan Fox, of course. Then it’s off on a progression of adventures that reach their apex when a group of Indians brings Hex back from the beyond. He inhales some digital smoke, coughs up a crow and shouts a Shatneresque “Turnbull!!!” Then? Howzabout a rushed steamboat-of-death finale involving the plastic-bag-loving videographer from American Beauty and Gob Bluth from Arrested Development? But by that point you’ll hopefully be passed out from all the pocket-flask shots you’ve swigged to survive this hex of a flick.

      <review><![CDATA["Bollywood does Kashmir in Lamhaa, and the results are quite predictable. Each of the three stars in the movie gets a proper Bollywood-style introduction. When we first see Sanjay Dutt, an undercover officer who is trying to uncover a terrorist plot in Kashmir, he’s walking in slow motion towards the camera. Bipasha Basu, a fiery insurgent, makes her appearance slashing a man’s throat and escaping over the rooftops with the ease of Supergirl. Kunaal Kapoor, a former militant turned peacenik politician, comes into view on a bike, the wind ruffling his curls. 
Lamhaa treats the Kashmir conflict with just as much subtlety. Director Rahul Dholakia tries to be hard-hitting, but the movie is actually bludgeoning in its impact. The hysterical pitch 
is intensified by the jerky camerawork and choppy editing. 
The movie follows the efforts of intelligence agent Jahangir (Dutt) to unravel a plot to cause mayhem in the Valley. He recruits Aziza (Basu), the ward of radical ideologue Haji Shah (Anupam Kher), who is modelled on Syed Geelani. Aziza’s half-baked love interest is Aatif (Kapoor), a moderate politician who is contesting elections in the state. Dholakia, who has previously made the superior Parzania, confirms every conspiracy theory about Kashmir. The mosques harbour fundamentalists. Children are being recruited by the thousand to become suicide bombers. Politicians and senior Army officers are conspiring to keep the state on the boil. Kohl-eyed insurgents are standing at every corner. Missing from the movie is the ordinary Kashmiri. If Dholakia bleeds for anybody, it is for the Kashmiri Pandits, the majority of whom were driven out of their homes by militants.
Several characters keep referring to “1989” as though a single incident on the scale of 9/11 kicked off the self-determination struggle in the state. The tragedy about Kashmir is complex and ongoing and cannot be reduced to a few incidents or a handful of people. In attempting to explore the issues facing the Kashmiri people through the prism of a thriller, Dholakia misses the wood for the chinars. Nandini Ramnath"]]></review>

      <plot><![CDATA[After being abandoned for eight straight years in boarding school, Rohan returns to the small industrial town of Jamshedpur and finds himself closeted with an authoritarian father and a younger half brother who he didn't even know existed. Forced to work in his father's steel factory and study engineering against his wishes, he strives to forge his own life out of his given circumstances and pursue his dream of being a writer.]]></plot>
      <review><![CDATA["There are two types of Bollywood papas. One is sweet and portly (and often wealthy) and dotes on his children. The other is an overprotective obstacle to romance that is eventually surmounted. Vikramditya Motwane’s debut feature introduces a third type: a father who loathes his children. 
Udaan is set in Jamshedpur, the steel city. The appropriateness of the setting (nicely captured by Mahendra Shetty’s camerawork) becomes increasingly apparent as Bhairav Singh’s character is revealed. The alloy seems to have formed a cast around the factory owner’s heart, preventing him from treating his sons Rohan (Rajat Barmecha) and Arjun (Aayan Boradia) with warmth and empathy. Bhairav abuses his children verbally and physically. He crushes the poetic ambitions of his elder son and the playfulness of the younger one. Udaan is the story of Rohan’s flight to freedom, but more compelling than his repeated efforts to form a bond with his father and brother is Bhairav’s destructiveness. 
Motwane, who co-wrote Anurag Kashyap’s Dev.D, is better at setting up a problem than solving it. The story occasionally goes in circles, especially in the scenes showcasing yet another example of Bhairav’s malevolence. There’s an implausible and distracting track exploring Rohan’s friendship with Jamshedpur’s riff-raff. Motwane sets up Rohan’s dilemma admirably, but doesn’t seem quite sure how to resolve 
it, resulting in an ending that seems forced. 
Yet, Udaan flies on many counts. The movie tackles its themes with sobriety and honesty. Through the unrelentingly corrosive Bhairav, Motwane mounts a strong critique of the warped ideas of masculinity and familial duty that are commonplace in India. The cast performs beautifully. Barmecha looks the part and inhabits his role. Equally impressive is Aayan Boradia as his little brother and Ram Kapoor in a small but pivotal role as Bhairav’s saner brothers. But the scene stealer is Ronit Roy, who effortlessly embodies both menace and the bitterness of a lifetime of disappointments. Nandini Ramnath"]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA["This is the sequel that John McTiernan and Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 1987 original deserved, as director Nimrod Antal delivers enough hard core sci-fi, explosive action and monster mayhem to justify its belated arrival. Forget the official sequel and the lame Alien vs Predator spin-offs, this Predator sequel deserves one of its own. 
Armed to the teeth but unknown to one another, a multiracial group of military/criminal killers (plus Topher Grace’s anomalous wimpy doctor) find themselves on a Predator hunting planet where they are the game. Faced with an evolved generation of super-Predators, Adrien Brody’s Hemingway-quoting, self-appointed leader (“There is no hunting like the hunting of men”) insists that their survival depends upon pooling their own killer instincts. Alice Braga’s svelte sniper is a tough yet tender foil for the buff, brainy Brody; with one notable exception, the remaining “dirty half-dozen” are merely disposable. Channelling Marlon Brando’s unhinged Colonel Kurtz, a well-padded Laurence Fishburne pops up halfway through as a surprise sole survivor, a striking cameo that nods to his youthful debut in Apocalypse Now.

      <plot><![CDATA["Tere Bin Laden" is a tongue-in-cheek comedy about an ambitious young news reporter from Pakistan who is desperate to migrate to the US in pursuit of the American dream. His repeated attempts to immigrate are shot down as his visa is always rejected. But when things couldn't look worse he comes across an Osama bin Laden look alike. Ali then hatches a scheme to produce a fake Osama video and sell it to news channels as a breakthrough scoop! Unfortunately there are serious ramifications as the White House gets involved and dispatches a overzealous secret agent on Ali's trail.]]></plot>
      <review><![CDATA["Tere Bin Laden will instantly appeal to fans of the 1980s movies Peecha Karo and Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro and the more recent Sankat City. The movies share a flair for irreverence, sharp political humour and deliberate tackiness. Abhishek Sharma’s debut feature converts its modest budget into a style statement. Tere Bin Laden is about little people with big dreams who bumble about trying to realise their ambitions. Although Sharma’s satire doesn’t bite as sharply as Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro, he extracts some good-natured and timely humour from America’s War on Terror. 
The movie’s intrepid hero is Ali (Pakistani pop star Ali Zafar), a television reporter who is so desperate to emigrate to America that he tricks a chicken farmer (Pradhuman Singh Mall) into posing as Osama bin Laden for a video. Ali hopes that the video warning will become his ticket to the States. Instead, the Americans send an FBI agent (Barry John) to investigate the matter. Sharma, working with an enthusiastic cast, aims for chuckles rather than guffaws. Although the humour is simplistic and occasionally silly, the movie is well-plotted and undeniably funny. The cast seems to enjoy itself immensely: Ali Zafar is charming and convincing, Pradhuman Singh Mall is as broad as he needs to be and Barry John has a great time chomping on his vowels.

      <review><![CDATA["Milan Luthria’s period gangster movie, starring Ajay Devgn and Emraan Hashmi as rival crime bosses, has a pretentious Hollywoodesque title that belies its deep roots in 1970s Hindi cinema. It’s a mouthful for the working-class masses who adore both Devgn and Hashmi, but it isn’t unappealing enough to keep them away either. 
Devgn conquered the gangster persona in Company. Hashmi stakes his claim as the new don on the block, both in the movie and outside it. We never thought the day would arrive when we would praise Hashmi for being anything more than being an ardent kisser. But Luthria has excavated the acting chops from beneath Hashmi’s abs and put the actor’s bad boy image to superb use. 
Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai is loosely based on the life of Haji Mastan, whose journey from poverty in Panaikulam village in Tamil Nadu to power in Mumbai has already inspired several films, including as Yash Chopra’s Deewar and Mani Ratnam’s Nayakan (which drew from the stories of both Mastan and his Tamilian partner in crime, Dharavi don Vardarajan Mudaliar). Once Upon a Time outlines the rise of Sultan (Devgn), his marriage to a movie star (Kangana Ranaut) and his popularity among poor Muslims. Sultan’s reign is challenged by an upstart, Shoaib (Hashmi), who is modelled on Dawood Ibrahim. So far, so predictable. Ram Gopal Varma showed a similar thing – and much better – in Company eight years ago. 
The movie is set in the ’70s, but bouffant wigs and outsized goggles alone aren’t enough to count for authentic period detail. Randeep Hooda plays a cop who tries to turn the situation to the advantage of the police, but the plot strand isn’t 
adequately exploited. 
However, Once Upon a Time isn’t a lost cause. Luthria, who acquitted himself honourably in Kachche Dhaage and Taxi No 9211, combines briskness and style to make his weak story watchable. He directs his actors well and has given meaty roles to Ranaut and Prachi Desai, who plays Shoaib’s lady love Mumtaaz. But the crew member having the most fun is dialogue writer Rajat Aroraa. Every line is a punch line, aimed at extracting whistles from viewers. Luthria and Aroraa clearly hope to evoke the spirit of the Amitabh Bachchan films of the ’70s – it’s unfortunate that they forget to tell a well-rounded story in the process. Once Upon a Time has a sharp beginning, a sagging middle and an inconclusive end that promises a sequel. That means more of Hashmi’s newly discovered acting abilities and yet another chance for Aroraa to churn out aphorisms like there’s no tomorrow. Nandini Ramnath"]]></review>

If it sounds like a checklist of summer-camp activities that someone has tried to pass off as a movie – well, it is.
Simultaneously strained and bloated, Grown Ups follows five friends (Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, 
Rob Schneider) and their families (the wives include the absurdly overqualified Maya Rudolph, Maria Bello and Salma Hayek) as they return for their childhood basketball coach’s funeral. It seems this middling Saturday Night Live crowd has settled into a complacent Big Chill phase, with no sense of what separates the desperate (questionable gags involving Rock’s sassy, flatulent mother-in-law) from the edgy. Despite its title, Grown Ups has little to say about maturity. (The one funny running gag involves Hollywood agent Sandler’s hyperspoiled kids, who marvel over seeing a TV that isn’t flat-screen.)

To add to his woes, the new municipal commissioner, Gehna (Trisha Krishnan) is his ex-girlfriend. 
We haven’t seen the Malayali original, but we’re guessing that it was so funny it deserved to be remade. The Hindi version has about five funny but unmemorable jokes. The rest of the time, Priyadarshan’s direction is mechanical and mercenary. He assembles a large cast, gives each of them a few minutes in the spotlight and makes sure that the movie looks pretty (thanks to cinematographer V Manikandan, it does). Priyadarshan doesn’t seem to notice when actors like Manoj Joshi and Rajpal Yadav are hamming, or when the humour has run out of steam. He doesn’t seem to care either, since his movies have a dedicated audience and almost always make money.

      <review><![CDATA["We’ve come to a point where we ask very, very, very little – and usually receive even less – from blockbusters: Wow us with a few cool-looking creatures and keep the bodily-function gags at tolerable levels. By those pitiful standards, this Disney-sponsored mediocrity, about a wizard (Nicolas Cage) and his reluctant ward Jay (Baruchel) who must, naturally, save the world from evil – succeeds. You get to see both a Chrysler Building’s Art Deco eagle and the Bowling Green Bull come to life and wreak havoc, in all their computer-generated glory. There’s only one flatulent-dog joke, and the ol’ plasma-bolt-to-the-crotch gag is, mercifully, not milked. You won’t fall asleep before the credits or feel dirty afterward, unlike with some other big-budget megillahs this season. It whizzes by more quickly than you can say “Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer,” while also being magically devoid of anything resembling character, originality or distinction. 
Journeyman director Jon Turteltaub does to boy-conjurer flicks what he did to Indiana Jones adventures with the National Treasure franchise, boiling things down to their bare genre essence, while buffing the borrowed elements to a blinding sheen.  Everything from the baritone voiceover (“The wars of sorcerers have been fought throughout history!”) to Cage’s Obi-Wan-on-ludes act screams autopilot. David Fear"]]></review>
