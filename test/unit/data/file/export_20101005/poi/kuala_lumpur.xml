        <description><![CDATA[<p>With its name literally meaning eat and drink, Khaana Peena gives no illusions as to where its priorities lie. This chic establishment serves Northern Indian cuisine with flavors that are both distinct and diverse. The décor is inspired by traditional Indian culture with influences of contemporary styles more than evident. The vibrant fabrics, tasteful paintings and unique coasters add a nice touch to the restaurant. Try the grilled fish with tomato relish for a nice twist from your customary Indian meal.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Growing from a humble stall in Penang, Kayu Nasi Kandar is currently a full-fledged establishment with a number of branches around town. Their roti tissue, a humungous dough cone filled with sweet sugary sins, is especially popular. For those with grainier desires, opt for the white rice with chicken rending and fried squid. The spiciness of the chicken blends exquisitely with the crispy goodness of the fresh squids. Adding to the experience is a number of plasma television sets placed around the restaurant. <br /><br /><i>Pork Free</i></p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the best outlets to fulfill your banana leaf rice craving. Service is slightly shady but the food makes it more than worth the wait. Their chili chicken is generously covered with a spicy dressing and certainly adds some flavor to your meal. Strangely enough, what Kavitha's does the best is the basic rice with vegetarian sides. Mostly taken for granted, Kavitha's fresh ingredients with a few scoops of curry is a satisfying meal without further pretensions.</p>

Furnishings are a blend of Asian and Western influences with comfortable sofas, wooden shutters and cool balconies providing a sense of luxury. A garden courtyard is available with rustic furniture is available for a more intimate dining experience. The cuisine is an exotic combination of authentic scents and textures from Asia. As such, the Indian cuisine isn't exactly extensive but do give the lamb Hydrabad korma or the salmon massala a try.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Tucked away neatly in a corner, Gills may not look like much at first glance. However, looks are extremely deceiving in this case as the food here has earned it some very admiring followers through the years. Ambience is simple with nothing to shout about. What really sets this place apart is the authentic cuisine such as the rich and creamy chicken makhani (butter chicken) and tongue-numbing fish curry. For those of less spicy cravings, opt for the palak paneer (blended spinach) which is tasteful while offering a welcome reprieve. <br /><br /><i>Pork Free</i></p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>A casual dining restaurant in the plush Gardens Mid Valley and Pavilion KL, Bombay Spice would be best described as an affordable melting pot of authentic Northern and Southern Indian cuisine. The walls adorned with sari fabric and the mosaic stained glass lamp exude a chic and contemporary ambience belying it's low-medium end status. Highly recommended are the Hydrabadi briyani and the flavorful prawn masala. After your invigorating meal, pick up some traditional condiments or delicately prepared chutneys which are available for purchase.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Located amongst a bustling area of Italian, Mexican and Mediterranean eateries, Deutsches Gasthaus more than holds its own with its many regular customers. Boasting a cosy, neighbourhood feel, it serves up a mean pork knuckle with the portions sufficient to feed half of Bavaria. With crispy golden skin and oh-so-tender meat, it comes as no surprise that this is their perennial bestseller. The smooth flowing beer from very 'experienced' taps will certainly help to wash the carnivorous meal down. Expect attentive and friendly service which will complete a very German night out.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>A hidden gem amidst the hustle and bustle of the main street at The Curve, Bavarian Bierhaus has everything you would hope for from a German restaurant. Ambience is relaxed with a very open feel. Ideal for group and family gatherings, it offers the usual bevy of top-class beers to accompany your meal. And it is no ordinary meal. The crispy pork knuckle (natch) with smoked bacon and honey is able to rival even the best of them. As an alternative, you could have the pancetta salad to limit the porcine a little. Reservations are recommended.<br /><br /><i>Non Halal</i></p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>What started off as a quaint tearoom behind the floors of MS. READ has grown successfully.<br /><br />
Overwhelmingly popular and rightly so. From the excellent breakfasts to lighter lunches and fresh, hearty and well-prepared mains (not to mention the to-die-for cakes and desserts), Delicious is an institution in Kuala Lumpur. The food is consistently superb and always served quickly.<br /><br />
Check out signature mains like the chargrilled grain-fed chilled tenderloin steak (250gm or 300gm) served with bearnaise, balsamic reduction or beef jus. Guests can opt for a choice of two sides with this extravangant dish. Recommended with a side of sauteed mange tout and rosemary garlic fried potatoes.</p>

The venue serves a mixture of fusion-infused food, local favourites, Western cuisine and international fare like Japanese food. <br /><br />
Among the highly recommended dishesinclude the Lobster Soup, Lamb Chop, Dragon tempura, Confit of Salmon Trout with Poached Oyster, roasted barramundi in potato wrap, wild mushroom with oxtail ravioli, foie gras, fusili with smoked chicken, and more.<br /><br />
Overall a very classy feel.</p>

Guests will also be entertained by a live band during dinner hours. <br /><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Under the Singaporean Chinese restaurant chain Crystal Jade, Amuleto is their western fusion offering. Something of a mish-mash, dishes can alternate between the simply satisfying and genuinely tasty. The menu features an extensive list of tapas, vegetarian dishes, rosti and a lavish choice of beverages. <br /><br />
Order a Papaya Salad with Chicken Floss Thai Style; the Quartet Soup (served interestingly enough - in shot glasses) and carry on to the Braised Lamb Shank for mains. Complete with the unique Green tea tiramisu.<br /><br />
Check out the Western Salmon "Lo San" for something healthy and different.<br /><br />
Clean, contemporary setting and decent service. On the pricey side.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Refurbished and cleaned up in early 2010, 7atenine is set to reclaim its mantle as one of the city's finest night spots. Be sure to stop by on 'white night' - a sensually surreal pure white  musicological experience, held every saturday.<br /><br />
However, it's worth noting that it's not all about the partying here. The menu caters to all day dining and the venue boasts a sun bar, barclay bar and a champagne pillar. The food is also worthy of a pleasant semi-alfresco meal opposite the city's most notable attraction. <br /><br />
7atenine's menu swings in the direction of cosmopolitan cuisine; specials include the kakiage, green tea smoked salmon and beef yakitori.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>A new kid on the block but already setting quite the benchmark for culinary excellence. The Press Room is from the same stable as La Bodega -guaranteeing a strong wine list - but is further up-market. The food is outstanding and the setting more than matches, but prepared to wait a long, long time for your food. One of the highlights of the brand new impressive development of Bangsar Shopping Centre.<br /><br />
Check out the double lamb chop with bubble and squeak; the Braised Wagyu cheek with turnip risotto; and the Saffron linguine with seared scallops, artichokes and truffle oil.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Third Floor takes diners on a journey of classic modern cuisine (french-inspired) with a blend of flavours from Australia and the Pacific Rim. Despite a lack of creativity in the naming department, this minor flaw certainly doesn't apply to the food as it serves up to 150 hors d'oeuvres accompanied by an extensive degustation menu by Chef Ken Hoh. Ambience is decidedly modern with a contemporary feel but not overwhelmingly so. Try the delectable foie gras with a caramelised-pear-and-burgundy reduction. <br /><br />
If this is a festive occasion, make use of the Chef's 5-7 Course tasting menu which offers treats from oscietra cavia to seared beef medallion with sarawak pepper to a cheese platter.<br /><br />
For a la carte recommendations, check out the sea urchin with jelly consomme topped with beluga caviar and gold leaf. For something meatier, try the lightly seared wagyu beef with calamansia and butter sauce.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the finest upmarket eateries in town, Pacifica permeates exclusivity and elegance and is an ideal location for business dinners or intimate social gatherings. The sleek and relaxing ambiance with warm decorations melds well with the breathtaking interior, each table boasting a circular veil of peach strings for privacy. Regarding where it matters most, there is no doubting the freshness of the seafood as ingredients are flown in twice a week. The variety of oysters is second to none. For dessert, order the soufflé, which comes with a choice of either chocolate served with orange ice cream or praline with toffee sauce.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Cilantro is back; it is in fact one of the more eagerly anticipated returns KL has ever seen. Foodies flocked to the freshly refurbished restaurant in quivering anticipation of what the hiatus would produce, both in terms of chef Takeshi Kimura's culinary creativity and the perennially sleek interior of arguably KL's best loved eatery. I would probably not be exaggerating when I say the magnitude of Cilantro's return was to KL-ites the gastronomic equivalent of a Beatles tour, assuming John Lennon could somehow be brought back to life. Let's not forget however that during that year, sister restaurant Sage had been deservedly earning plaudits for its obviously Cilantro-inspired cuisine. Challengers to the throne were also clamouring for attention. Throw in the hype about the impending relaunch and it was obvious Cilantro had to really dazzle in order to justify the excitement.<br />
     Which is why the unshakeable sense of sameness not just to the décor - the same beige-cream-off-white hues dominate the same circular seating with banquettes at the side - but also to the service (albeit rather more perfunctory this time round) and the menu made the landing all the more discomfiting. Perhaps the management wanted to ensure a sense of continuity but it sure felt disturbingly reminiscent of a friend who left many years ago only to return untouched by time and trends, telling the same well-worn jokes and wearing the same style of attire he had always done, when we had all obviously moved on.<br />
     That's not to say the food and service have deteriorated. Au contraire. The same faces with the same impeccable manners continue to serve the same signature Cilantro classics, which brings me to my original point precisely: what, if anything, had changed?<br />
     Certainly not the freshly baked bread and complimentary truffle butter that is a peril for those with a low resistance to temptation of the tasty kind, nor the panfried unagi with foie gras, a masterclass in fusion done with alacrity. Even the gold standard - the angel hair pasta crowned with sea urchin - can still be found, and it continues to scintillate with its mouthwatering juxtaposition of flavours and textures, with the al dente pasta providing a perfect foil for the creamy sea urchin roe.<br />
     Perhaps I'm missing the point but the prodigious talents of chef Kimura would have been better served had he given us a fresh glimpse of his culinary innovation with this revamp rather than more of the same. <br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Mabuhay! The only restaurant in town which serve dishes in Filipino style, Cagayan (named after a province in Philippines) serves up pork ribs and Filipino cuisine in a humble setting dining place. Patrons can choose wide menus of mainly pork cooked with Filipino style. The food is relatively fairly priced and more importantly, rich, scrumptious, and authentic. Check out the Golden Mushroom Bacon Maki which consists of golden brown Enoki mushrooms wrapped with pork bacon. For mains, try the 'Little Piggy' which is pork ribs dripped in oriental soy sauce and served with potatoes and salad.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Drunken brawls, tattoo-littered hooligans, nauseating restrooms and bad jokes. Modern pubs have done away with these unwanted accolades (except maybe bad jokes) and have cleaned up their act tremendously. Somewhere at the top of this list lies Bulldog Pub and Café located in the ever-growing Sri Hartamas. Ambience is relaxed with the typical whiff of an English pub floating in the air. Serving traditional English pub grub, their perennial favorite Toad in the Hole is a must-try. Head on upstairs for a quick game of pool with your mates. The hearty portions of each dish are a nice bonus. An epicurean's dream.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Yearning for that 'English-ness' away from home? The Teapot Café could (in some lengths) quell that homesick feeling with its quaint little interior filled with a myriad of teapots of all shapes and sizes. With the ambience of a typical old English-garden atmosphere, this humble, unassuming establishment is best known for its roast beef which is as scrumptious as it is huge. And what English café would it be if the word 'scones' isn't on the menu? On the Asian section, try out the unusual Roti Jala (Net Bread) or just play it safe with Malaysia's unofficial dish, the Nasi Lemak.</p>]]></description>

The menu features an array of Oriental influenced dishes and has an indefinite 'zing' or buzz that keeps diners coming back for more. Let's hope its not MSG. <br /><br />
Headed by Master Chef Leong Weng Heng and crew, the venue houses a fine selection of live, exotic seafood (so you know it's going to be fresh), dim sum, home-styled specialties, special noodley dishes, and roasted and barbecued items.<br /><br />
Pork free, the restaurant does not lose out in any customers (the menu is extensive and makes up for the lack of pork).</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Elaborate yet contemporary, the halal Chinese restaurant at the Prince Hotel has the standard of dim sum you would hope for - a delectable selection of the finest.  Plus a wide selection of other treats from the Orient. <br /><br />
The award-winning Tai Zi Heen is beautifully interior decorated which is almost as impressive as its innovative menu. You can't miss the extraordinary 2000 piece crystal chandelier in the main dining hall. The wood, marble, art pieces, and glass all create a very soothing and classy ambience. <br /><br />
Start off with the Sweet &amp; Sour Crab Sauce on Fried Mantau; carry on to the crispy roasted chicken with schechuan sesame sauce, and complete with a very refreshing chinese tea. </p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>A family-style restaurant in Taman Tun, the Sun Yau Tak Teng eatery is becoming increasingly popular. If you come at peak hour you may have to wait around before you get a full table to your party. But the venue sometimes clumps you with another party if the wait is too long. Be prepared for some uncomfortable conversation. <br /><br />
Though, it may be worth it- this little place in TTDI is the epitome of good local Chinese fare. A perfect place to makan and chat with friends over the usual stir fries or something a little more unusual, such as the marmite prawns. Other favourite dishes include Pork in Pineapple and Dai zhao with double boiled soup.</p>

Centrally located,and right opposite the Istana Hotel, the restaurant is a good stop off point for tourists, they serve great Chinese cuisine and the menu features the city's best shark fin's. Definitely worth of inclusion in any food outlet list, but on the pricey side. The shark's fin alone costs RM38. Among other highly recommended dishes are the Fish Maw and Scallop Soup, the Steamed Fish, the 'Pei Pa' which consists of 10 different styles of ribs. For vegetarians, there is the vegetarian mushroom dish which comes with a surplus of sweet gravy.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Enjoyable aromatic Taiwanese cuisine, even if the portion is a little bit smaller than elsewhere. Definitely something to complain about especially since the venue has come away with some good food reviews. On the pricey restaurant, this place is perfect for once in awhile celebrations.<br /><br />
Usually very busy, it's ideal to book ahead to guarantee a table at the eatery. <br /><br />
Try Fong Lye specials such as the '3 bei chi' which consists of chicken cooked with chilli, basil leaves and black soya sauce. A must order - especially for the sweet-tootheds!<br /><br />
Check out the Taiwan style glutinous rice wrap-up sausage - a similar bite to a western style hot dog (if a little hard to hold). <br /><br />
Overall, a gentle and comfy ambience (plus a lounge with big cushion chairs for the waiting area).<br /><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>All the way from Queensway London, this eatery is new in town. Apart from their famous roasts a.k.a the legegendary mouth-watering roast duck, you should try Hong Kong style dishes like Stir-fried Kai Lan and BBQ pork ribs. Check out Four Season specials such as the Hong Kong style Poon Choi, the Fried Ho Fun which consists of a rice noodle with beef in a black bean sauce, and the Honey Barbecued Pork Char Siu which is very moist and sweet.<br /><br />
Something different to try is the fusion-infused dish, the Pork Chop Cheese baked rice is one for cheese-lovers.<br /><br />
For budget food, you're hard pressed to find better value with an individual serving of duck rice for no more than RM8++.<br /><br />
In general however, the menu is above the usual price range, but definitely worth it given the authenticity. If you're not a big eater, don't fret - portions come in three different sizes.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Tip top Cantonese food; this is a real five star experience (in the five star Renaissance hotel) with its traditionally Chinese-style room and beautiful interior. A fine dining experience no doubt, Dynasty is popular for its Cantonese cusine. All the usual suspects are on the menu: dim sum, home-made specialties, as well as some unexpected treats; cold starters in the northern style or deep fried yam balls or Peking Duck. Check out the homemade tau foo far for dessert. The food is pricey, given the five star location so be prepared to pay around RM50 per head. <br /><br />
Vegetarian options are also available.<br /><br />
This is dining fit for an Emperor. </p>

With its interior themed black and white, the restaurant is modernly furnished. Barely discovered by the KL crowd, CUBEs has already got a name for its fine Chinese cuisine. <br /><br />
The venue caters to Asian and Western tastes with its combination cooking.<br />
Highly recommended is "probably the best London aromatic duck" in Malaysia, served together with crepe, spring onion, julienned cucumber, and special sauce.<br /><br />

Even though the well-known former owner has moved on, Chow Yang still serves mouth-watering food including pork stew, chicken with ginger, hokkien fried meehon, sweet and sour pork and tofu with crabmeat. <br /><br />
Check out the black chicken in herbal soup with mee suah. Relatively strong in taste, this one's for Chinese herbal soup noodle-lovers. Save some room for the 'king of teas' in Chow Yang restaurant to wash down your meal.<br /><br />
Overall, the eatery is comfortable, the food is satisfying, and the service is not too bad either.</p>

Guests can also enjoy dim sum brunches, which is well worth sampling, particularly the Har gau (prawn dumplings) in the mix, and the Buddha Jumped Over The Wall Dumpling in Sharksfin Soup.<br /><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>With the name meaning 'Brazilian Grill', Bossa Nova is the city's number one example of a churrascaria - grilled tender cuts of meat straight off the skewer. Imported from Argentina and Australia,  all cuts of meat are of prime quality.<br /><br />
Check out the buffet dinners, with every order, Bossa Nova serves complimentary oyster Rockefeller. The venue also houses a wine bar with labels from Latin America, Chile,  Argentina, France, Australia and more. Order a bottle to compliment the  prime cut.<br /><br />
The dance floor lets you boogie on through Salsa and Samba before and after your dinner. The fun and exceptional quality of meat more than proves value for the price tag.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Who knew that New Zealanders could cook such good noodles and other Asian delights? If you're adventurous, go for the plate of baked escargots on french bread and cheese, with freshly cut tomatoes on the side. For mains, check out the seafood basket which includes prawns, squid, fish and a side of vegetables.</p>
<p>If you're a rice foodie, check out the seafood fried rice, delicious. And of course- you can't leave without tasting the signature drink - a glass of refreshing Kiwi Fruit juice! They stress value here with big portions at affordable prices. And the quality is not bad either.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>A sister restaurant of the fabulous Café Café, the Banquet is  decidedly different; from its feminine interior ( chandeliers, flowers galore, wicker chairs), to the food and service. <br /><br />
Planted more-or-less in the middle of Bangsar Village II shopping mall, it offers local and western cuisine with most dishes of a price between RM20-RM30. Quite high for the standard of food served.<br /><br />
Order aromatic chicken wings or the sauteed portabello and button mushrooms with garlic for the starter, carry on with either the oven baked butterfish with cream of honey mustard or Lamb Shank , and complete it with Tiramisu. You can't go wrong with these dishes.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Popular with families, Outback has been around for many years. Unspectacular but consistent, with the one near Low Yat Plaza especially handily situated for tourists and the like who seem a little out of their depth trying the local fare in the heart of the Bukit Bintang/Jalan Alor triangle. <br /><br />
Outback takes great pride in serving the freshest, highest-quality food possible. The venue serves authentic dishes using authentic ingredients. Check out the USDA Choice steaks, the imported Danish Blue Cheese, toasted hand-cut croutons, the homemade chocolate sauce. At Outback, it's all about quality — and all about the food. Among the feature items on the menu is the signature sirloin paired with succulent Snow Crab, served with a dressed baked potato.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Who doesn't love dim sum, the Chinese version of tapas? Without question the best dim sum outside of five star hotels (and possibly even with them included) in KL. Taking dim sum off the streets where they are more frequently dished up in a ruckus-like environment, A Little Dim Sum Place is different. They do all the old favourites but with an attention to detail that guarantees quality (and of course without the noisy disturbance or pretension). Its many specialities include wu kok (deep fried yam puff), har gao (prawn dumplings) and char siew bao (honey barbecued pork buns)...if you still have the appetite.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Brussels Beer Café is a great place to enjoy a variety of delicious Belgian meals. The café has an excellent interior and comfortable seating area for customers to either to dine or to mingle around the bar.</p>
<p>Comfortable, and uncomplicated, Brussels Beer Café is actually reminiscent of the smaller, snug watering holes of Europe. The crowd is friendly and generally consists of the city's urban working community.<br /><br />
The selection of beer ranges from Australian Crown Lager to the good old Belgian Hoegaarden and can be served in generous five-pint glasses. Service is good, but can be slow.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>One of Malaysia's most historic landmarks, Dataran Merdeka (Merdeka Square) has a special place in the country's history. Situated in front of the iconic Sultan Abdul Samad Building, it is here where the independence of Malaysia from the British was announced on 31 August 1957. Hence the name. <br /><br />
Since then, Dataran Merdeka has been the usual venue for the annual Merdeka Parade (National Day Parade). It is also used for various celebrations, most notably as KL City's official New Year Celebration venue. You can't miss the huge 100 metre flag pole flying the Jalur Gemilang, which is the tallest freestanding pole in the world.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Time Out rating: 1/2 /5<br />
Fun in a bun? Not so much<br /><br />
The tatty, stained frame next to our booth enquired, 'Are you having fun yet?' The implication being that if you were in anything short of rapture as you sat pinned into the too-tight booth supping your 'bottomless beverages' and digesting your basket-served meals, there was no one to blame but yourself.<br /><br />
Now, call me an old misery guts but I somehow managed to avoid all traces of fun at Chili's. That could be because I'm the sort of person who gets hung up worrying about whether the name of the outlet should have one or two 'l's or it could be because I dislike bad service and mediocre food - you decide. <br /><br />
Being a family restaurant - although the four hour long 'Happy Hours' hardly sit with this projected image - and us being a family it seemed a not completely inappropriate choice for a weekend lunch and the steady stream of other family units that joined us affirmed Chili's status as a KL favourite. Psychology students looking for a topic for their dissertation thesis might like to explore this popularity as potential evidence of KL-ites' inherent masochism. <br /><br />
The aforementioned and much heralded (in multi-coloured chalk no less) 'bottomless beverages' arrived to a fanfare of tickertape and popping champagne corks as gymnasts spring-boarded their way across the restaurant with a cavalcade of ribbons. Not really. They were placed drearily on the table. I won't comment on the fact they are served in plastic beakers. I assume it is to prevent us going too overboard on the fun (no, I still wasn't having any if you were wondering).<br /><br />
Big credit point for them bringing the children's meals first. In fact, there's only one other place in KL I know that does this without being asked. It makes a huge difference, allowing us to avoid hunger tantrums and also leave the adults free to enjoy their own meals after the kids are done. <br /><br />
Further kudos for the fact that these meals were free. Yes, that's right: kids eat free when an adult dines. That's really impressive, although also a somewhat cynical (if successful) marketing tool. To my mind 'family friendly' should be more about serving fresh, hearty food and allowing children the opportunity to interact with both friends and their dining environment rather than getting a couple of deep fried chicken nuggets gratis. <br /><br />
Having been denied the right to a medium-rare burger (not that great a sacrifice as my medium was cooked identically to my partner's well done) I was pleased that their beef was of good quality, very good given the price. Although the less said about the unspeakable accessories that came with it the better. I expected my 'Ranch Burger' to have earned its title through its Ranch Dressing. Still, I suppose Bland Barbecue Sauce and Stringy Old Lettuce Burger would be less catchy. And certainly less fun (no, still not). <br /><br />
As my eye glanced back at the sign to my left, I reflected on the word 'yet'. Maybe if we stayed long enough we would finally achieve this fun we'd heard so much about. The length of time the waiting staff took to bring our bill (we asked four members of staff before it arrived) suggested they were willing us on in this endeavour, but sadly it came before we so much as raised a smile.<br /><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>A decent outlet that gets through a lot of covers (especially so in the tourist hotspot on Jalan P Ramlee) with all the steaks, chimichangas, and other Latin American produce you would expect.  Maredo is  the perfect venue for dinner before heading out to enjoy the night scene on  P.Ramlee. The menu caters to carnivore's cravings galore, with an extensive list featuring  mainly beef dishes. Highly recommended is the Surf &amp; Turf grilled  strip loin steak which is tender and juicy to perfection. Order the medium  rare for best results. In all, good lunch set deals, slightly pricey due to the bigger portions, and cute Argentinian flags in your meals.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Don't be distracted by the other western offerings - even at special promotion - on the menu at Gaucho. As with any self-respecting authentic Argentinian restaurant, it's all about the steak. Quickly becoming a a hunt for those hankering for a satisfying steak meal, Gaucho's is famous for its tender and succulent cuts of fresh beef cooked to perfection. With its open fire and  grilling, this is the quintessential place to enjoy beef the Argentinian  way.The chefs know what their doing so be brave and go bloody. Don't forget to take advantage of the happy hours throughout the week, from six to eight thirty in the evening.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>With cool décor that pairs steel tension cables with various nuts and bolts, you can understand the significance behind the name; the initials did spell out 'Work in Progress' though since their makeover recently, the meaning has shifted to 'Whipped Into Place'. The food is great and cocktail list amazing; try a Bloody Mary topped with a liberal helping of celery and they don't skimp on the vodka or Tabasco either.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Solaris adds another club to its quiver by way of this half club/half bar haunt that has a moderate sized dance floor with a cool crowd. Some good DJs have spun there, DJ Nikki and others, but they've told us they're toning down on the electronic music. Okay, that may save a few shekels but be careful Spin Club, KL Klubbers expect to be entertained.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>A steady fixture in the KL night scene for over ten years now, Souled Out remains a popular hangout spot, especially among the city's youths. The extensive menu serves decent, uncomplicated grub and standard drinks but the steady crowd is mainly due to its energetic and lively atmosphere. Never empty, this is a busy hub for patrons to eat, drink, listen to live bands and play a game of football.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>This club does not open at 11:15 or close at that time. The scene and décor here change frequently which can be confusing. It is inspired by a schoolhouse, sports bar, and India. Despite the unique décor, Club 11:15 does offer some of the cheapest beer in town. On Thursdays, you will also meet a lot of women enjoying free wine until 10pm.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>A newly-refurbished nightspot tucked away in a shopping mall away from the city centre. Bar Celona draws a strong crowd of young partygoers almost every night of the week. Music mostly consists of R&amp;B and the partying rarely peters down before closing time. On Ladies Night, girls coming in groups of five or more are entitled to a free bottle of vodka. </p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Chic and comfortable, the Apartment offers urban living for KL urbanies - a large, loft-style space to unwind in.  Very cool concept; you can eat in the bedroom, the library or even the shower.<br /><br />
In addition to a wide selection of beer and cocktails, it also serves up fusion food; clams or mussels 'Apartment Style', the tenderloin steak and the baked fish were all delicious.  However, non-alcoholic drinks can be highly priced. Every Friday and Saturday, the KLCC outlet plays host to live acoustic sessions by local performers. Happy Hour at this outlet is from 2pm to 5pm daily, with prices starting from just RM10.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>The Gallery @ Starhill engages diverse audiences in powerful experience of artistic invention and serves as a catalyst for the creation of new works that inspires and challenges. The Gallery "knows" that art is important as looking at art can provide a much needed refuge for reflection, sympathy, quietude, inspiration, and even ecstasy in this increasingly chaotic world. Looking further can deepen knowledge of cultures and artistic practice, develop and hone observational skills, reveal insights into history that other documents can't, and encourage creative, analytical, and autonomous thinking.</p>
<p>Art can be funny, and it can make you cry, too. Having all these in mind, The Gallery dedicates to the promotion of Malaysian contemporary artists. Exhibitions are being organized at regular interval throughout the year for artists to showcase their new works, a wellspring for them.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Surely it must be an unarguable, incontrovertible, Darwinian fact that if 'it ain't broke, don't fix it'. When international designer Ed Poole tells us about 7atenine's new facelift, we are a little skeptical. We have high standards when it comes to our drinking spots; if functionality and design can come together to form a perfect union that is chic and stylish, all the better. There are things that do stand out and the Big Ass Fan is one of them. It is exactly what it sounds like and apart from the fact that it's impressively massive, there's nothing much else to say. <br /><br />
We do, however, applaud the new flower-shaped bar (it revamps the traditional bar counter so you no longer have your back to the room) as it makes it a hell of a lot easier to get the bartender's attention… which is the whole point, really. The new lighting system has 16 million colours at its disposal; not noticeable to my naked eye but very cool nonetheless. 7atenine's draw has always been its lovely open-air ambience - all these new enhancements and design features do nothing to detract from or add to it.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Dubrovnik is a quaint European restaurant located at Solaris, Mont Kiara that simply exudes a truly unique chic dinning experience with wholesome food for you and your family. From hand- made pasta to the bread baked daily in a wood fire oven, this quest for excellence in food preparation demands perfection and authenticity in the culinary offerings.<br /><br />
Dubrovnik just spells great home cooked cuisine at its best, leaving you truly wanting for more. A lot of attention and detail is given to food preparation and to the choosing of the freshest of products, combining rustic, home-made dishes with the modern cuisine accomplishments.<br /><br />
The menu is unabashedly traditional yet refreshingly different without the artifices of 'fusion'. The pastry section showcases exquisite mouth watering desserts which complete the menu in true perfection.<br /><br />
Everyone who dines at Dubrovnik will love the ambiance which evokes the authentic feel of being in the medieval city on the Adriatic coast. The only Croatian restaurant in Malaysia, and probably the only one in Southeast Asia, Dubrovnik is definitely very different from the typical Western restaurants.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Laila's Cafe and Lounge is situated in Plaza Kelana Jaya, beside the Kelana Jaya lake. It has a modern day concept of a "home away from home" feel of where they try and give their customers and friends the ambiance of being in a home environment.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Innovative and spacious, Quattro is made up out of four outlets, each themed after one of the four seasons. The establishment copies Mother Nature as best as it can, incorporating a miniscule 'snowing room' and a dripping wet corridor to 'rain' on partygoers, all in the name of fun.</p>
<p>The al fresco Spring Lounge fares best with its kitschy furnishings and view of the Twin Towers. It is also one of the only venues in KL that sells absinthe.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Mist caters towards the young urban set. The DJs ensure a good time almost every night, and the black leather seats , pulsating lights and stark metal ceiling beams lend a punk edge to the atmosphere. Artists at Mist in the past have included Lil Jon. Recently, Mist has also started expanding beyond the nightlife scene by housing events like a clothes sale and fashion show.</p>]]></description>

First the location, on the sixth floor of the Gardens with a great inside and outside view of the Mid Valley area. The interior is a stunner, cool and fluid with the perfect sense of style and differentiated covey holes to hang and explore. Aye Caramba, this place will be huge. <br /><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Just seven months after it closed down its popular theatre in Bangsar Shopping Centre, The Actors Studio will be moving into its spanking new theatre on the rooftop of Lot 10 Shopping Centre.</p>
<p>This all-new theatre is nestled amid overhanging foliage and other greenery that is part of the rooftop's Forest in the City concept (yet another genius idea by Seksan). The chic and minimalist interior gives it a warm and inviting atmosphere.<br /><br />
Without a doubt, the star of the theatre is its dramatic Hanamichi-thrust stage  the first of its kind in the country. Those familiar with Kabuki will recognise its T-shape formation although the thrust section is much wider than the traditional Hanamichi. That coupled with its three-sided, bench style seating makes it an intimate yet exciting space that will open up new staging possibilities.<br /><br />
What's even more exciting than the theatre's unique design is its location right in the heart of town. It is merely a stone's throw from the monorail station and countless F&amp;B outlets!<br /><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Time Out rating: 4/5<br />
It's all good</p>
<p><br />
In a city inundated by budget-conscious, meat-loving punters, it's a brave move to open an <i>haute cuisine</i>, let alone fish-driven, restaurant. But the team behind Nero Vivo has done just that, and even though it's a bit premature to predict whether or not they will strike culinary payola, the early signs show that KL-ites are going for it hook, line and sinker.<br /><br />
Don't get me wrong, it's not as if it's never been done before: Kingfisher back in the late '90s (the restaurant, not the dodgy Indian pub) was a pioneer, not just in paving the way for the phenom that is now Changkat Bukit Bintang, but also with a menu that was intrepidly fish-centric and characterised by sparkling, nourishing flavours. With the exception of perhaps Pacifica at Mandarin Oriental, High Tide's arrival on the scene, well, let's just say it was High Time. <br /><br />
Helmed by Belgian chef Evert Onderbeke, the menu comprises "fresh, seasonal and sustainably caught seafood" which, apart from ensuring diners never get bored of the same food (if they can afford to eat there on a regular basis, that is), should be a delicious way for Malaysians to get acquainted with such lesser known seafood as roughy, king fish and marron.<br /><br />
Because the seafood is flown in from Europe, Australia and even Japan on a daily basis, the cost — let alone the carbon credits — incurred in getting the fish on your dinner plate is substantial. But what price such exquisite cuisine? Whether it's a simple vegetable ravioli with black winter truffles in a shitake emulsion (moist, ephemeral, memorable) or a more elaborate sole in bouillabaisse broth with <i>rouille</i> and croutons (a virtuoso exercise in textural and taste combinations) you're tucking into, the attention to detail, the presentation, and culinary expertise are all irreproachable, and ample vindication for the substantial price tags.<br /><br />
And here are three more reasons just for good measure: 1) The spectacularly delicious complimentary <i>amuses-bouches</i> (velvety soups in shot glasses and paradisical seafood morsels) and post-prandial <i>petits-fours</i> (the fig cream cannelloni is magical) 2) The superb service by manager Carole Pinel, and 3) The unmistakeable sense of well being that follows such a memorable dining experience.<br /><br />
With so many of the city's restaurants bogged down by a sense of sameness, High Tide's food provides a salubrious blast of originality to jaded palates, and quite apart from the dietary benefits of 'free-range' fish cooked at its prime, I can say — for myself, at least — that High Tide is a sterling example of the philosophy that 'if a job's worth doing, it's worth doing well.' Three cheers.</p>
<p><i>Lunch and dinner daily except  Mondays</i></p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Culti is not a fashion brand but promotes a high-end 'holistic' lifestyle, as it prefers to be known. Judging by its price tag, buying into the brand is definitely a sign that you've made your riches, as everything in the store costs hundreds. Whether it's home fragrances, pyjamas, bathrobes or home furnishing products, you can be assured of quality, well-made products resplendent in minimalist styles. These are goods that'll outlast trends.</p>
<p>Among the lot, Culti excels with its range of cotton-linen pantsuit styles (RM1,200) pyjamas. When wearing one, it does feel light and luxurious on skin. Although I don't want to wear it for sleep, as I'm rather rough with my clothes. Maybe Culti's range of bathrobes (RM800-900), also made from cotton and linen, would be more suitable, as they're supple enough to be used with careless abandon.</p>
<p>Culti's home fragrances, however, are recommended. Try the Mareminerale (RM300-500 for half litre), made from sea salt minerals and musk, and producing an overall refreshing scent. Ideal to spray on your home's sofa, bed sheets, curtains and even your clothing. Granted this home fragrance costs more than most of the choices available elsewhere in KL, but it really is some quality stuff, one which will leave a nice lingering scent for a long time.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>One thing first: I'm a waxing virgin. Aside from a few mishaps with birthday cakes, not a drop of wax has this body seen, so it was with some trepidation that I approached my first date with the hot liquid at Honeypot Wax Boutique. It's only been open a few months but already garnered its fair share of positive reviews and Brazilian-enthusiasts, so here I was dispatched to put my body on the line and test the waters and mix metaphors.</p>
<p>The good news: Honeypot really does deserve the acclaim it's been getting. The bad: due to my well-documented cowardice, I didn't go the whole hog and get a Brazilian wax, but stuck to my genteel guns with a leg wax. My waxer (a great job title, if there was ever one) swiftly put my mind to rest regarding the pain factor, assuring me that it was nothing like as painful as most newbies imagine, just possibly a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p>She then instructed me to lie down and relax as she inspected my legs (always a hard time for a girl). What comforted me the most about the whole affair was when she pointed out two scars on my knee and ankle respectively and asked if they were recent developments and if they were still painful, explaining that they don't touch just healed scars. It's nice to know that someone with the responsibility of covering your skin in hot wax knows what she's doing.</p>
<p>The waxing itself was uneventful, and after I'd got over the initial shock of having warm wax rolled onto my shins and then pulled off, I began to unwind a little. I still wouldn't say it's a relaxing way to spend an afternoon, having hair ripped out of your skin, but as banal as it sounds, it really isn't that painful.</p>
<p>Honeypot also does a remarkable job of calming the senses with its predominantly pink décor, dim chandelier lighting and lovely scented wax. They use a strawberry wax for general waxing and a cherry wax for more sensitive areas - given how nice the strawberry smelt, I'm almost tempted to return to test out the cherry. Baby steps.</p>]]></description>

Kepala ikan, fish head bathed in a piquant yet sweet-and-tangy, assam-based broth, is another very enjoyable dish for those who prefer a coconut milk-free alternative to fish head curry. use of MSG is avoided whenever possible, an alternative is used in place of palm oil and the cooks also make an effort to drain off excess oil.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Decked out in curved wood panelling, B3 looks like a cross between a Tokyo subway station and a comfy log cabin. the classic cheeseburger is a juicy pink patty enveloped in a blanket of soft, caramelised onions.</p>
<p>The sesame butterfish burger had a slightly wet texture, but the wasabi mayo gave it a kick worth savouring. Ingredients for the ice cream were back in stock, so the meal ended on a sweet note: the rich, home-made dark chocolate soft serve, a real treat that made a refreshing change from uniform vanilla or chocolate.<br /><br />
With the latest addition to his canon of eateries, Low's B3 is a prime example of the new breed of express-class restaurants that haven't sacrificed freshness in their bid to emphasise taste and quality.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>I don't think highly of buffets. I tend to believe that they are put together with whatever that's left over in the kitchen from the night before mixed with whatever's going to expire soon. That's just me - cynical. Imagine my surprise when I walked into DISH's new Brilliant Brunch (which comes with free flow of Verve Cliquot champagne) and discovered that the spread read like a gourmet menu.<br /><br />
For once, in a buffet, I felt like a kid in a candy store; I felt hungry and greedy and gluttony. I wanted everything. There was an extensive chilled seafood spread of tiger prawns, salmon sashimi, crabs and freshly shucked oysters. The live cooking egg station could whip up a hot fluffy omelette filled with turkey ham, mushrooms, peppers, cheese and yes, even lobster. The carving station was decked out with roast prime beef rib and roast chicken, while the BBQ station had all the variety of meat cuts, fish, squid and ocean trout. On top of all that, you have the cheese, pasta, salad and antipasti, fruit and juice, sundae, and dessert stations.<br /><br />
My advice is to take everything in sampling portions and have the pan seared foie gras with Muscat dressing in between every dish. It's that good. The fact that it's cut into small canapé-size pieces means you only get enough to tease your palate but never enough to satisfy the craving if you are a fan like me. And since it's cooked upon order, you get that buttery texture melting warmly in your mouth. The scallop on shell with herbed dressing is light and fresh while the mozzarella, tomato and basil skewer provides a nice mix of tasty flavours in your mouth all at once. Just remember to wash them down with champagne.<br /><br />
While most of the dishes were well done, it was the desserts that really stood out for me. The earl grey cream managed to be a little on the heavy side without making you jelak, thanks to the tea infusion. And the three different varieties of truffles - green tea, homemade chocolate and white chocolate blue cheese (I know what you think but it works - strangely) - are so soft, smooth and velvety when your mouth closes around them.<br /><br />
Another good thing about the spread is a lot of the things are made to order, such as the pasta and the salads and the yummy foie gras. So it felt less like a buffet and more like a kitchen at your beck and call. Despite the decadent food, the setting managed to remain casual and relaxing without becoming too high brow and intimidating. It had an anything goes attitude in here. And partly because the restaurant shares the same space with fine food deli and a florist, the ambience was lively and fun, which made for a leisurely and really enjoyable Sunday outing.<br /><br />
Excessive? Maybe. But DISH aims to be unabashedly decadent and they do that very well with this champagne brunch. So, pardon my over zealous enthusiasm but with all that bubbly swimming in my tummy, I can't see how I can not be, well, bubbly.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Shanghai Tang, a classy fashion and accessories outlet in Pavilion has just launched its latest fashion collection "Love Restraint". Mainly inspired by fashion style and trend of the sixties in Hong Kong, particularly from the movie "In the Mood for Love", trendy combined with op-art which emphasises on a rejuvenation of the geometric graphics of op-art with a new sense of modern fluidity as seen on delicate silk blouses with optic clouds print and silk jacquard trench coat with optical illusions of waves in motion. Shanghai Tang caters to the urbanite male, female and children with its exclusive brands in fashion wear, jewellery items, accessories, leather wear and goods, Chinese jades selection, silk, just to name a few.<br /><br />Shanghai Tang originates from China and boasts itself as the first and leading luxury lifestyle brand since 1994. It promotes and supports the fusion of modern Chinese Chic with current design concepts emphasizing on innovative Sino related elements.<br /><br />
Shanghai Tang through its international network of 40 boutiques located in the world's most prestigious shopping district, offers ready-to-wear for both men and women and children, including accessories and home ware. The Malaysian outlet is at Pavilion KL. Based on my personal observation, Shanghai Tang is aggressively promoting expressions of past Chinese glory combined with modern elements as evidenced in its fashion wear, accessories and home ware, which compliment each other. <br /><br />
Shanghai Tang Boutique is situated on Level three, Pavilion KL.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Spa treatments are good in that they provide a temporary, relaxing respite from your daily chores and stress. But massage, a good massage, is truly remedial. That I have learned from Donna Spa. I was having a bad week. I was lethargic and to make it worse, I didn't sleep well at all. My therapist Ina, who's from Central Java, seemed to have that figured out.</p>
<p>The 90-minute Excellent Donna Massage that I have chosen as part of the Value Spa Scrub Package is easily the best massage I've had in KL. Using long strokes, Ina worked on the acupressure points to expel wind from my body while stimulating healthy blood circulation. 'Ini mesti sentiasa duduk,' she said while massaging two tensed knots on my lower back to break them up. 'Banyak main computer ya?' she asked, though it sounded more like a statement when she worked on the even more tensed shoulders.</p>
<p>Then she spotted a stubborn knot ('urat simpul,' she explained) at the lower back of my head. As she was massaging that, she explained to me that the wind in my body, which accumulated at my lower back and shoulders, manifested into tensed, hard knots. If not treated, the wind can move up to my head and cause headaches and migraines.</p>
<p>Wind can also lead to a tired and weak body, and affect sleep. Usually I like my massages conversation free but this time, I kept asking her questions and found it fascinating that she could tell so much from just massaging my body and more interestingly, that she could tell that a particular spot would hurt even before I felt it.</p>
<p>As she slowly loosened up my incredibly tense and tired body, I could feel my body getting more relaxed, and I was now craving a long sleep. Ina comes from a generation of mid wives, where they administer this deep-tissue traditional Javanese massage, or at least a variation of it, to strengthen the body and improve the immune system of mothers who have just delivered.</p>
<p>The two-hour Value Spa Scrub Package came with a coffee scrub (using coffee powder imported from India) to smoothen the skin. Feeling really decadent, I topped up for a rose petal milk bath (RM220) to rehydrate my dry skin. The air soon permeated with the delicious aroma of milk coffee, which made me smile.</p>
<p>Yet more than the spacious room and the oversized bathtub, the one thing I appreciate more was that throughout the treatment, I was lying on a comfortably warm heat blanket that covered the lower half of the massage bed. And that, as Ina explained, was very important as it prevented me from getting cold; else wind would get into my body, and end up causing more harm. Lim Chee Wah</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Rating:3/5</p>
<p>While it is mostly true that you should never judge a book by its cover, sometimes it's doing precisely just that, that you must. If I had a dollar for every time I've walked into a restaurant that's given me the heebies and, hot on the heels of my reservations, the food turned out to be execrable, I probably wouldn't be writing to earn a living now. Luckily, the upside to that is sometimes you also come across little gems that you know will be 'keepers' the minute you step through the door. Mezze is one of them.<br /><br />
"Feels like I just entered a Melbourne eatery," my friend remarked when we visited. I know exactly what she meant. Melbourne is famous for cosy little bistros infused with eccentric charm that is mostly whimsical but nearly always original, and Mezze has that same charm in spades.<br /><br />
Naked lightbulbs with retro wiring are the focal point of the décor, and the effect is effortlessly striking. Co-owner Perin Petrus says the eatery/bar's raison d'etre is to serve as a venue for friends to get together and share memories and food. While I'm more than happy to share memories, I'm not so sure about the food, since the dishes at Mezze are generally — in the words of an enthusiastic chav — pretty lush.<br /><br />
The slow roasted pork belly with its cracking crackling is so good I'm considering another visit just to jog my memory, but its position as favoured starter was definitely challenged by the dreamily smooth duck liver pate with a texture that was almost aerated. <br /><br />
Although I'm wary of ordering mussels in Malaysia because more often than not it feels like I'm chewing on a small child's earlobe, Mezze's steamed mussels may well help me overcome my phobia. The tamarind, lemongrass, ginger, chilli and honey broth in which the mussels are served should be declared our Asian response to the moules mariniere. Adore, adore, adore. And though I'm not generally a dessert person, the panna cotta in all its quivering, acquiescent glory did it for me. <br /><br />
The downside is that as the area is becoming increasingly popular, parking can be challenging, especially on weekends, but since the wine list at Mezze is fairly priced and thoughtfully selected, you've got no business to be driving anyway. Take a cab and get there early.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>3.5 stars<br />
Middle Eastern</p>
<p>Tarbush is an established name in KL when it comes to Middle Eastern food. Later this year they expect to open in Batu Feringghi, Penang, but our meal took place in the slightly more chic surrounds of Starhill Gallery's Feast Floor.</p>
<p>An early weekend evening, the restaurant was quiet enough for us to earn the full attention of the (apart from their insistence that we should require French fries as an appetizer) helpful team.</p>
<p>Eschewing the fries in favour of a variety of mezze dishes, we cleaned the plates in no time at all. The judging of any Lebanese or Arabic meal naturally affords much to the appetisers, and they were off to a good start. The hummus I normally prefer smoother and the serve of tahina was not the most generous, but otherwise the offerings were outstanding.</p>
<p>The lamb in the kibbeh was joined by tiny chopped onions and crammed with spice. I hadn't tasted any to this recipe before but it was superb. Worth going back for all on its own. Likewise the sambosa, which were a bit heavy for starters but full of taste. The vine leaves were also excellent and the falafel fresh, crispy and could only have been improved by being presented with more in the way of that tahina.</p>
<p>Having crammed so much food in at such an early stage we had to rein things in a bit. That meant sharing a portion of rice for main course and getting just one dish between us. But what a dish it was. The 'Tarbush Mixed Grill' included all their main meaty offerings, from Shish Tawook, a variety of kebabs, lamb chops and several of their arayes (spicy minced lamb). I find with most Arabic meals that the meat tends towards the overdone (frustratingly, the Greeks manage to get the balance right consistently in similar dishes) although Tarbush was better than most and the crispy, somewhat tough lamb and chicken was helped enormously by the evidently long period of marination the meat had enjoyed.</p>
<p>Given the huge numbers of Arabic tourists that come to KL, it is little surprise that the city has plenty of good Middle Eastern restaurants. Tarbush is, despite some small areas for improvement, clearly among the best.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>As you walk into Sash, you'll notice delicate traces of perfume in the air. Not overwhelming on the senses, these scents nicely mingle with each other in the store, ebbing and flowing depending on where you stand. The store is done up in the pastels of an English cottage, with a large French Provincial dining table showcasing some of the crystal and crockery available in the store.</p>
<p>Created to be a one-stop shop for homeware and gifts, Sash offers gifts scoured from all corners of the world: 100 per cent Egyptian cotton towel and bed sets, handstitched silk and velvet duvet covers from Italy, clear and coloured Polish crystal, crockery from Australia, Michel Design Works fragrance diffusers and soy wax candles from New York, as well as handmade natural vegetable and fruit soaps from Austria.</p>
<p>But for me, the star products are the 'Sweet Treats' range of bath and body care from the Australian eco-friendly company Urban Rituellle. The lip balm (RM32) comes in 18 different flavours, and is made with beeswax, sweet almond oil, olive oil, shea butter, vitamin E and sunscreen. The range also includes body cream (RM58) made with shea butter, jojoba, macadamia and avocado oils; creamy vegetable soap made from vegetable oil, cocoa butter and vitamin E; as well as candles (RM60) made using 100 per cent natural soy wax.</p>
<p>Also available is the Sweet Delights gift set (RM80), which comes in five different flavours - Vanilla, Ginger Apple, Pomegranate, Peach Blossom and Cotton Candy. Each set contains a 12ml perfume, a 100g creamy vegetable soap and a 20g lip balm. There is also a limited edition candy cane lip balm available for the Christmas season. Plus, their free wrapping service will blow any of your efforts with sellotape out of the water.</p>]]></description>

        <short-description><![CDATA[KL first allergy friendly yoga and dance studio for kids and adults.]]></short-description>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Just when we thought we'd seen enough yoga centres in KL, out comes Purple Yogis, which claims to be the first allergy friendly yoga and dance studio in the country. But it is the centre's special attention to children and some unusual yoga classes that got our attention.</p>
<p>The Kids Holistic Yoga (age four to 12) classes are run very differently to the adult ones. Here, the children literally play yoga. They are free to move about the room, take part in breathing games, make noises, act out stories and even pretend to be animals. While this may not sound like the composed and peaceful yoga that we know, Purple Yogis instructors believe that storytelling, games, music and art are the best ways to engage the hyperactive children. And through these playful but structured classes, children can develop better body awareness, concentration, coordination and balance.</p>
<p>For the adults, Purple Yogis has something equally fascinating. Apart from the usual Hatha and Vinyasa Yoga, there is the Slimming Yoga, which over the course of three months, teaches you techniques and postures to help detoxify the body and build up overall muscle strength. It is said to increase flexibility, improve vitality and even transform the way you look and feel about yourself.</p>
<p>Couples Loving Yoga is even more interesting. With poses like 'Couple's Lotus Pose', 'Couple's Turtle Pose' and 'Couple's Moon Triangle', we can't help but think of the Kamasutra. But before you start giggling like a teenager, let us assure you that this yoga is a great way to help you and your partner learn how to balance and work with each other's strengths and weaknesses. And by supporting each other through modified asana sequences, you will be able to move beyond any self-limiting ideas of what you can or cannot do.</p>
<p>But if all this is too new age for you, well, Purple Yogis also offers classes in break dance, hip hop, Bollywood jam and Cuban salsa. Oh, feel free to bring along your children and leave them to play in the Kid's Room while you work through your sun salutations.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Formerly located at Asian Heritage Row, Bisou was known for its cosy calm café setting with a pretty white interior and a team of amiable staff who makes you feel really welcome. Now that they have moved to Bangsar Village, Bisou might not be as laidback as before but has kept its friendly staff and of course, the famed cupcakes. While the menu has been revamped to include plenty of new salads, paninis and soups, eliminating the less popular dishes, Banoffee Pie fans should heave a sigh of relief to know that the best-seller stays on.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Delicious' little sister<b> D'lish</b> is out with a new menu, veering from their previous premise of fast (but good) food to a weightier dinner menu and mains. Their new direction takes them by way of the Mediterranean, with plenty of Spanish, Greek and Middle Eastern flavours. There's also some old favourites, reimagined D'lish style - look out for the excellent roast beef, salt beef and ox tongue sandwiches, and a novel dish of poached skate. There's fresh flavours in the piquant tomato soup ingeniously served with a finger of grilled cheese sandwich, and grilled mushrooms topped with crispy cheesy bits. If it's a salad you're after, there's a new range to choose from, including an inventive pairing of haloumi and watermelon, a classic roast lamb and mint, and several other cheesy offerings. <br /><br />
D'lish <i>(Ground floor, Bangsar Village I. 03 2288 1770/ www.delicious.com.my) </i>is open from 8am daily, and serves dinner from 6pm daily. <br /><br /><i>Emma Chong</i></p>
<p>TOKL - June 2010 Issue</p>
<p></p><p>The winner of Time Out KL's best cake/back shop in the 2009 awards fully earned its accolade following consistently brilliant production of cup cakes, pastries and other snacks and delights. A well earned treat for literally thousands of people after their trawl around next door's Village Grocer supermarket each week.</p>
<p><br />
The cake counter at D'lish is always tempting. They have a range of dreamy cupcakes (the raspberry brownie cheese cupcake is particularly good), pastries and bars, all good for that quick sugar fix on the run. If you're not in a rush though, the recliners lining the back wall are perfect for lounging on while licking the frosting off the top of your favoured cupcake.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<p>D'lish was voted the Best Cafe/Bakery in the Time Out KL Food Awards 2009. The Time Out KL's food awards are 100% voted for by the people of KL. This way, we guarantee that popularity and consistent performance is rewarded.</p>]]></description>

Just think...an All American dining experience - steak, chips, fried macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, chicken, mousse and brownies.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>The only, and therefore the best, Austrian restaurant in Malaysia is homely and authentically European.  Tucket in the newest night spots of Mont Kiara, Karl's Beisl is famous for its porky-ness. The food is just one of its strengths, especially the pork dishes, with a friendly atmosphere and great selection of beers alongside it. Something of an unsung hero and a wonderful alternative night out. A must try is the roasted sucking pig which is juicy in the inside and crispy outisde. This one is for pork lovers galore, the Choucroute Garnie is a combination of pork belly, kassler ham, bratwurst, frankfurts, and the special sauerkraut.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p><b>Bodytone Wellness Studio</b> takes an exercise-oriented approach to weight loss. It offers to take care of three things for you: exercise, slimming and anti-aging. In fact, it is the first Power Plate authorised centre in Malaysia, a machine which apparently commands a star-studded list of followers such as Claudia Schiffer, Kylie Minogue and even Rafael Nada. Okay, it may sound a bit too gimmicky at first but what this Advanced Vibration exercise does is transfer vibrations to the muscles in your body, which causes them to contract in a reflex action. By holding a pose for up to 60 seconds at a time, you will then be able to tone and firm up your body, accelerate fat loss, enhance flexibility and even improve your fitness and stamina. It hardly sounds like a work out at all but Bodytone claims that you can see results in just three sessions a week.</p>
<p>For slimming, the 517 Ultrasound Lipolysis treatment on the menu can be combined with the Advanced Vibration exercise to promote slimming. It breaks down fat cells into free fatty acids and sugar, which will be released into the blood stream and later consumed as pure energy as you work out. As for anti-aging, the Total Body Photo Stimulation Skin Rejuvenation Treatment uses light to stimulate your skin to start reproducing collagen to help reduce wrinkle and increase hydration.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>A brainchild of Geoff Siddle, Sid's pubb has established itself as the cosy neighbourhood drinking hole in a number of locations. Welcoming to all - including children and pets - Sid's has a reputation for being almost a home away from home. The friendly staff and regular patrons have made a name for Sid's in the 'pubbing' scene. But it doesn't just end there, the pub grub has also cemented Sid's in people's hearts, with customers loving the hearty, home-cooked appeal of the affordable English food. Try the pigs in blanket, bangers and mash, steak, Sunday roast and steak and kidney pie.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Sid's Pub is a finalist in the Time Out KL Food Awards 2009 Best Pub Grub category. The Time Out KL's food awards are 100% voted for by the people of KL. This way, we guarantee that popularity and consistent performance is rewarded.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>The George &amp; Dragon is fashioned to look like a typical old English tavern and it's hard not to imagine being in England when sipping a pint while sitting on one of the barstools. Aside from the beers, pub crawlers come here to look for typical British food like the famous toad in the hole, bangers and mash, pigs in blanket and who can ignore the ultimate British dish fish and chips? The menu at the pub is kept simple and concise so that quality is consistent. If you're one for teatime, you can have English afternoon tea here with scones and clotted cream. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>The stalwart KL Irish pub chain has survived as one of the best places in the city to catch live sports. With each branch known for a different game, enthusiasts will have their own favourite venue, but for sheer variety, Finnegan's several locations are tough to beat.  Finnegan's is now a favourite haunt for a refreshing pint, live Irish music, typical pub grub or even just a friendly chat. A good selection of beers on tap also help the action flow but for a taste of Ireland, try the Ulster Fry (a typical Irish breakfast) and the house favourite, pork snackers (a platter of pork ham, bacon and sausages served with English mustard). <br /><br />
Outlets: Desa Sri Hartamas (03 2300 0538), Bangsar Baru (03 2284 0476), Mid Valley (03 2284 8157)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Finnegan's was voted the Best Pub Grub in the Time Out KL Food Awards 2009. The Time Out KL's food awards are 100% voted for by the people of KL. This way, we guarantee that popularity and consistent performance is rewarded.<i><br /></i></p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Pride of India serves up colourful and aromatic dishes that are mostly of North Indian origin, as such most dishes are mild, but there are some that's based off the South Indian fare, which means they're really spicy, so you should think twice before jumping straight in with the spoon. Spicy dishes or not, you're definitely spoilt for choices here. Decorations are minimal, but arranged neatly, giving the impression of a really spacious room. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>If you must miss one thing on the menu at Passage Thru India, don't let it be the tandoori chicken (or the accompanying naan). They only serve the leg portion, and it is juicy, red without being startling, and perfectly cooked. On the other side of the taste spectrum, the bhona ghost (mutton curry) is dense, savoury and satisfying, and afterwards you can soothe your burning tongue with their range of classic lassis, because one is never enough. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>To eat at Max's is to love it, and to love the extraordinary, super-talented chef that owns and runs the place. His kitchen is surprisingly small but he produces simply stunning creations, using natural, delicious ingredients. The seafood is exquisite, the wagyu beef top drawer and the lamb arguably the best in KL. Max also boasts a wine list better than a restaurant that size would normally command. But the real treat and what makes Max among the city's top food outlets is when he goes 'off menu'. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>A gem neatly tucked away on the mezzanine floor of Hilton Kuala Lumpur, Senses is intimate and personalized. Serving modern Australian dishes, Senses uses only sustainable seafood and organic products so you can dine with peace of mind.  The seafood is simply magnificent and includes probably, no, definitely, the best scallops in Malaysia.  <br /><br />
Each dish is thoughtfully presented and immaculately prepared. If you don't know what to order, try Smoking Allowed (Tasmanian ocean trout smoked in front of your eyes) and the refreshingly satisfying beetroot and scallop salad. Practically works of art, the desserts here are worth overstuffing yourself with at the end of the meal.<br /><br /><br /></p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>At H5, the minimalist stark white interior looks designer chic. But when you browse through the cult watches that are encased within the lit glass inserts along the wall, you realize that this space feels like a modern museum of design, which is exactly what the owner Tong Chee Wei is aiming for; he has created the store as a homage to pop art and culture.<br /><br />
Save for Philippe Starck, all the brands of watches that you find here are only available to H5. Each of these brands has garnered a cult following internationally and they look more like pieces of wearable design art. Nooka, which comes from the States, is of course the pride of H5. According to Tong, <b>Nooka</b> (RM559-RM1400) is a fusion of urban New York and anime Japan. It is very current and modern at the same time, a style which Tong labels as 'techy fashion forward'. There are several crossover editions in stores right now such as SpongeBob SquarePants and Kidrobot.<br /><br />
Using block colours, <b>Noon Copenhagen</b> (RM559-RM719) has a clean design, which speaks a lot about its Danish roots. The highlight of this watch is its patented design where the clock face changes colour according to the time. <b>LIP</b> from France (RM700-RM1800) on the other hand is charmingly retro. Its classic design is now regarded as pop art. Even so it still looks classic and professional, something you can wear to work or party. It even has a series of LED watches. They may look digital but they are not-it's so fascinatingly old school.</p>
<p>You might also find <b>Fei Yue</b>, a fashionable sneaker brand from China that was once a staple among Shaolin Kung Fu masters.  Tong plans to bring in another cult brand, <b>Nixon</b>, which is very street, very colourful and has been a hit among skateboarders. Although there are already some in store (Kathie Olivas' The Scavengers), Tong plans to bring in more urban designer vinyl toys such as those from Michael Lau. Oh, if you are really into toys, ask the store for the 'secret stash'. Due to the space constraint, some of the goodies are not on display but they are certainly for sale.</p>]]></description>

        <short-description><![CDATA[Pure Energy proves that just because treatment prices are lower, it doesn't mean we have to scrimp on quality...]]></short-description>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Everybody wants to go no frills nowadays. Even spas. However, Pure Energy, the award-winning Energy Day Spa's trendy little sister, now open at the refurbished Nomad Sucasa, proves that just because its treatment prices are 20 to 30 per cent lower (than its elder sister), doesn't mean we have to put up with inconsistent service, discounted qualities and bad/utilitarian design. <br /><br />
Here is what I like most about Pure Energy: the design is ingenious. The minimalist interior is dominated by four treatment cubes, each constructed of wooden frames and art canvas walls. The decor is simple, earthy and comfortable. It almost has a sort of Japanese zen-like simplicity to it, which is very soothing. While some spas go all out to wow the customers, the design at the end of the day can become rather intimidating. Pure Energy has none of that. The space and the design is very functional, down to earth and I like that a lot. And instead of the lame instrumental tunes, Pure Energy plays down tempo chill music.<br /><br />
Pure Energy caters to busy executives on the go; someone who wants a quick fix in between appointments. Its treatments, which range from full body, shoulder and foot massages to facials, scrubs and waxing, also come in express 30-minute versions, which start from just RM35. There are comfy loungers for those foot massages or quick clothes-on body works where you can enjoy a cuppa and take advantage of the spa's free WiFi. Yes, Pure Energy has WiFi. Good eh?<br /><br />
For me, I decided to go for a lengthy session. I started with the dry body brushing (RM45/20min) whereby my Balinese masseuse, Balek, lightly scrubbed my skin with a short bristle brush (in the direction of the lymph nodes) to stimulate blood circulate, remove dead skin cells and help my body detox. Although at first the treatment seemed a little ridiculous, the repetitive movement of the brush slowly gave way to a soothing effect. And seeing how I had to go to the toilet after that, I suppose the treatment did work after all.<br /><br />
Next came the spa's signature Purity Special full body massage (RM120/60min). This oil massage is a blend of relaxing and deep tissue massage so while it is pampering, the masseuse also pays extra care to those tensed muscles. The moment Balek put her hands on me, I knew it was going to be a good massage. Her pressure was strong yet measured (a quality not as common as we think as many masseuse are just strong and brutal) and she seemed to have an intuitive sense of how the body works.<br /><br />
Lastly, I finished off with a foot massage (RM50/30min). For this treatment, Balek did apply pressure on several of reflex zones at the base of my foot. However, it is not one of these excruciating proxy massage of your internal organs. Instead, it is a comfortable and enjoyable massage that soothes tired feet.<br /><br />
While Pure Energy doesn't have all the common spa luxuries such as a full-service lounge, sauna and Jacuzzi, it still feels very much like a complete spa. And they are very strict on hygiene - separate towels for foot and body. The treatments are great and thorough and the space is cosy. So even though you're paying less for your massage, there's no short-changing you here. I will go back there again. Lim Chee Wah<br />

        <short-description><![CDATA[Everyone knows that Nyonya food is home food, and that if you're a member of the community...]]></short-description>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>4 stars<br /><br />
WARNING: This is a review of a Nyonya restaurant. If you are Straits-Chinese please stop reading and move on to the next review. Everyone knows that Nyonya food is home food, and that if you're a member of the community you can't eat Nyonya dishes out without comparing them to grandmom's. In a contest between the gulai tumis you ate growing up and the gulau tumis set in front of you at a restaurant, we both know which will invite your scorn. <br /><br />
For the rest of us, there's Padi Prada. Owner Sharon Koay and her husband Nick are Penang natives; Sharon's a Nyonya and heads up the kitchen of their six-year-old restaurant. Are her dishes authentic? I wouldn't know, having grown up far away from Penang. But they are prepared well, with top-quality ingredients, and in many cases taste as good as anything I've eaten up on the island.<br /><br />
The gulai tumis is a personal favourite: red snapper, tomato wedges, and lady fingers floating in a red-orange sea of piquancy. It's sour and spicy but not overpowering, so you can taste other ingredients like lemongrass and shallots in the slightly thickish gravy. Ju hu char is every so slightly sweet, with forward sotong flavour, and the soft jicama bears no trace of wok char (a real turn-off for me with other versions). It's served with absolutely fresh, crispy iceberg lettuce leaves and an in-your-face fishy sambal belacan. If you're a chili hound ask for the 'special' sambal, an extra-pedas concoction with a hint of kalamansi tartness that's guaranteed to get your eyes running and your nose sniffling.<br /><br />
Lorbak arrives hot from the fryer, two golden brown logs of crackly beancurd skin plumped with five spice-scented pork. Because it's freshly made the bean skin is separated from the meat, and it shatters under tooth pressure; the pork is just fatty enough to be moist but not so marbled as to ooze oil. Fans of the pig should also consider the tau eu bak, with its thin slices of three-storey pork bathed in a soy sauce-based gravy that walks the fine line between sweet and cloying. The kitchen displays its talent for deep-frying with this dish as well; the bean curd cubes sport a delicate coat of notably crispy skin.<br /><br />
Vegetables aren't given short shrift. Our jade green kai lan was cooked to perfection, stalks tender but leaves not mushy, a hint of rice wine adding interest. Wing beans get the sambal belacan treatment in the wok and arrive crisp-tender. Rojak is a recent addition to the menu; while I could always go heavier on hae ko shrimpiness, the dish gains my admiration for avoiding the excessive sweetness of other versions. Peanuts and sesame seeds are served alongside for you to add as you wish and the crispy you tiao, bearing nary a hint of old oil, are a refreshing change from the oil-soaked flat crisps most vendors add.<br /><br />
Don't miss the umbra juice with sour plum, fresh-pressed and not over-sweetened. Complimentary dessert 'soups' (green bean, red bean, gadum, pulut hitam) arrive after the meal, but if you've still got room go for the cendol, made with 'pasta' that's a cut above (firm, pandan-scented), good-quality smoky-sweet gula, and extra-rich santan.

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Just like its name (The Burrow) suggests, this boutique is appropriately hidden and a tad difficult to find. The only mark of its presence is a small nondescript sign on the ground floor that simply declares 'MNEP'. You'll have to trudge right up to the top floor, past a solicitor's office, and push through a glass door that opens straight up to a bare black wall.  <br /><br />
However, once you walk inside, it's a different story. MNEP stands for Manual Epoch and as owner Maggie Pang explains it, 'It reflects our clients. They are not confined [but instead] drive their own trends and times'. This boutique is definitely trendsetting. The walls are painted black, yes, but instead of being drearily emo, it actually plays into the ambience quite well. <br /><br />
The atmosphere spells urban underground rebel; from the large black and white poster of an artistic nude woman hanging on the wall to the sounds of soft rock and electro playing from the DJ console in the middle. 'I wanted to do more than just sell clothes. I want to make this a lifestyle destination,' Pang enthuses. Black couches and low tables are set up for patrons to lounge on and sip a soft drink or beer from the small bar. Appointments can also be made for a bona-fide tattoo artist to ink you up. And all you boys take heart; there is even an Xbox to play with, complete with large projector screen. We hear the owner is planning to bring in a Wii soon. <br /><br />
Unlike many other stores, MNEP: The Burrow actually has a bigger selection for you manly men than for the ladies. 'There are already so many outlets catering to women but so few for the guys. We wanted to do something about that,' says Pang. Priced between RM200-300, most of the men's merchandise is from the New York brand, 'Supreme', imported directly from the United States. The rest is either from Hong Kong or by local design/DJ collective, Lap Sap. Besides the normal casual wear, the stuff on sale includes bags, shoes, caps and other accessories.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>If you find yourself needing to take a break from being a part of the machine, why not turn up this Sunday at the newly opened yoga centre BE Yoga located at the Metropolitan Square in Damansara Perdana for their weekly Karma Yoga session? It's completely free but token sums can be contributed which will in turn be channeled to deserving charities in Malaysia. <br /><br />
Founded by the official yoga ambassador for adidas Malaysia Ninie Ahmad, and one of Asia's most renowned Ashtangi Azmi Samdjaga, BE Yoga believes in giving back what they've gained, which was why Karma Yoga was formed. <br /><br />
Apart from that however, they are also offering about 200 yoga classes per month. Members can choose from the usual Hot Yoga, Ashtanga, Pilates, Yogalates as well as the more unique Prenatal Yoga, Partner Yoga (a fun yoga class practiced with a partner, peppered with a bit of Thai massage and basic acrobatic yoga movements), and the fun Yoga Dance (a fusion of the gracefulness of dance and the discipline of yoga). Parents need not fret as there is also something for the young ones that tag along - Kids Yoga. <br /><br />
Classes are taught by internationally-recognized yoga teachers and the centre boasts some of Malaysia's highest accredited teachers from world-renowned yoga schools of Iyengar, Ashtanga, Vinyasa and other disciplines of yoga. Each teacher specializes in a certain type of yoga instead of being jacks of all trades, masters of none. <br /><br />
BE Yoga prides itself as a yoga sanctuary, with its three spacious studios exposed to natural light through large glass screens, surrounded by trees. The centre is equipped with a large washroom, with multiple shower rooms, lockers, and a Wifi enabled lounge area. <br /><br />
Membership starts at RM88 monthly. Students with a valid student ID will enjoy a 10 per cent discount on any unlimited package. BE Yoga is open from 7am - 9.30pm on weekdays and from 9am-5.30pm on weekends. Karma Yoga is scheduled at 10.15-11.15am every Sunday.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Anjappar was a surprise. I'm a huge fan of Indian banana leaf but must admit that often the curries and veggies adorning my leaf at various vegetarian spots begin to taste a bit same-same. I was looking for something to pique my interest in Indian food all over again, and I found it at this 'up-market' (if 'up-market' means aircon, servers nattily attired in white shirts with black bow ties, and brass serving dishes) Chettinad spot in Bangsar.<br /><br />
Chettinad cuisine is among India's spiciest, and Anjappar's Chettinad chicken masala, chunks of tender bone-in chicken bathed in a gorgeous brick red sauce fragrant with cinnamon, cloves, cumin, and especially black pepper, certainly lives up to the billing, leaving lips a tingle and tongue on fire. Palak paneer soothed the heat. With a good solid spinach flavour and plenty of milky paneer cheese, this pureed vegetable dish is reassuringly olive in color (other versions around town are sometimes a shocking - and suspicious - shade of jade green. Sometimes a dal is just a dal, but not as Anjappar makes it: rich with legume flavour, featuring al dente yellow lentils that have been pulled off the stove before they turn to an indefinable mush, and studded with bits of chopped pegaga that add an intriguing hint of vegetal bitterness, and just a little spicy from whole dried chillies. <br /><br />
The restaurant's basmati rice is just fine, slightly nutty and dry enough that the grains remain distinct, but the full-on flavours and slightly oily sauces of Chettinad food cry out for an accompaniment that's solid and wheaty. Which brings us to my only complaint. While Anjappar's naan is tasty enough, freshly made as it is and touched with dark spots from the oven, ours arrived just lukewarm and soon turned cold, rendering what was probably at the start a pillow-soft round of bread as stiff as a piece of cardboard. If Anjappar could figure out a way to deliver naan and keep it warm at the table it would make a real difference. <br /><br />
Mellow, milky masala chai is the idea end to a highly spiced meal. Thumbs up to the Anjappar manager who took our tea order and actually listened when I said 'Very lightly sweetened please.' For once my chai tasted of tea first, milk second, and sugar last, rather than the other way around. Robyn Eckhardt</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Saturdays for me aren't eventful and I intend to keep it between me and my couch in front of the TV. But that one day, for a change of scenery, I decided to throw on some decent clothes and head out to the Spa Village at The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur.<br /><br />
Even though Spa Village KL is an extension of a resort spa brand, this urban adaptation did not lose the sense of space and privacy. The spa has its own swimming pool surrounded by lush greens, and the treatment suites are light filled to create a cheerful, airy space. They even come with an outdoor courtyard each, fitted with rain shower and an oversized sunken bath. Unlike most urban spas that make you feel walled in, Spa Village creates the illusion that you are out in some tropical resort.<br /><br />
I started with the spa's signature Sensory Exploration treatment (RM150/60 minutes). This treatment is one of its kind in KL, and I was told it's even the region's first. Much like a cleansing ritual, it consists of a light breathing exercise, a rediscovery of your five senses (taste, smell, touch, sound and sight), and finally neck, shoulder and foot massages. Prior to that, I was asked to write down my worries on a piece of paper using an ink pen. And during the session, the piece of paper was put into a bowl of water to signify the act of letting go. Seeing the words dissolve into the water, I must admit, was surprisingly a therapeutic experience.<br /><br />
The room was pitch dark, save for the blinking LED lights ahead to stimulate a starry sky. The floor vibrates lightly with the earthy reverberating sounds. It's quite unnerving at first when the lights were switched off. Slowly, you are overcome with a sense of peace and comfort as if you could no longer be harmed by the outside world. It may sound far-fetched, I know, but it did feel that way. And at the end of the session, I was asked to choose a gemstone, which I was to hold in my palm, put it to my heart and make a wish. The entire session felt like a reboot, both mentally and emotionally. To be honest, with all the spas that I have been reviewing, I have never felt so renewed.<br /><br />
Well rested, I moved onto a one-hour Malay massage (RM225), which features long kneading strokes that focus on muscles and the body's pressure points. As expected, the massage was excellent, my masseuses' pressure was spot on and she even paid more attention to my perpetually tensed back. As such as I was trying to find fault with the spa (this is after all a review), the only thing I find lacking is a stool in the changing room for me to sit on while I change back into my shoes. Trivial, I know.<br /><br />
For the rest of the day, I spent it over an elegant afternoon tea (RM68) at The Lobby Lounge at The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur. They have over 40 tea selections ranging from black to green teas and floral/herbal infusions. When the waitress pushed over the tea cart, I was momentarily stupefied by the exaggeration of tea choices but I finally settled on a rich vanilla infused black tea. The three-tiered English afternoon tea set came with lots of freshly made goodies. I particularly enjoyed the caramel scones, mini sweet mango cheese cake and the raspberry chocolate.<br /><br />
So far my most fulfilling Saturday ever. (Now, if only this were a couple's weekend together, but I digress.)</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Boutique proprietor Cindy Lim is a fan of trends. Nowhere is this more evident than through the collections available in the debut of her flagship boutique in Jaya One, which is a long awaited extension of her highly-popular online store. Inspired by the chic styles seen in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China, this outlet's products are sourced directly from these countries. Lim's boutique doesn't just limit itself to clothes - accessories such as bags, jewellery and cufflinks are also available, which should please the fashionistas out there.<br /><br />
Items are re-stocked on a regular basis (fortnightly) as Lim makes it a point to travel monthly in search of the latest trendy pieces. Lim caters primarily to women between the ages of 20 and 50 so she includes a little something for everyone. Prices for accessories range anywhere between RM10-35, bags from RM95 onwards and women's apparel are all priced below RM150.<br /><br />
Despite the store's large collection of social or party outfits, office wears and handbags are proving themselves quite popular. According to Lim, there are several exclusive pieces from Hong Kong that will be making their way to her shelves and online boutique soon. So keep your ears and nose to the ground... or, alternatively, save yourself the hassle and visit the Threesixty website to keep yourself updated on the latest news.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Following a massive opening fanfare that involved the appearance of its co-founder Edison Chen, Juice has opened its first Southeast Asian store in Kuala Lumpur. Located in Bangsar, the Juice KL logo is significantly different from its parent company, JUICE Hong Kong, whereby the KL version is emboldened with our Malaysian flag colours, namely red and blue. However, let us make it clear that this boutique has nothing to do with a magazine of the same name that we have here in KL. <br /><br />
Carrying cult brands such as the house-line CLOT apparel, limited edition Nike, adidas, OriginalFake, Medicom Toys, Kuumba and HeadPorter, there's no doubt that this boutique appeals to those with a flair for street couture. As you enter the store, you'll notice its futuristic ambience that is enhanced by LED lighting effects. It has the look and feel of a chic, modern lounge, really. The unconventional use of wood, steel, glass and corian is designed to incite curiosity; so even if you are not intending to buy anything, you'll at least step in to have a look. <br /><br />
The opening of this branch will certainly attract those that fancy Hong Kong urban gear, footwear, toys and accessories that interlink the worlds of music, design, retail and fashion. The store and its clothes, with an underlying hint of hip hop culture, are definitely catering to the young. All we can say is, if you fancy limited edition fashion fads and labels, get ready to empty your wallets.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Traditional izakayas were once the stomping ground of the weary Japanese businessman, out for drinks after slaving away at work. These days, it seems the izakaya attracts a larger circle of clientele - Izakaya Ichiban, for one, was patronised by diners ranging from couples to families when we made our trip there.</p>
<p>Amidst snug surroundings (warm yellow lighting, earthy décor) we started with the cool, chilly kai sen salad. Lettuce and cucumber were tossed with raw scallops, sweet shrimp and a smattering of tobiko (flying fish caviar) before being drizzled with wasabi dressing and mayonnaise. The scallops and shrimp were sweet and fresh; however, the wasabi dressing barely made a blip. It's not that I enjoy ingesting large quantities of the piquant paste, but slightly more wasabi would have added a zingy kick.</p>
<p>The una tama toji (eel cooked with eggs, onions and mushrooms) was great comfort food, and it would have been even better if the eel hadn't been quite so riddled with bones - there seemed to be more than usual. Nevertheless, the clear consommé the eel had been cooked in was eagerly slurped up by all.</p>
<p>The chicken teriyaki wasn't a very adventurous choice, but we were pleasantly surprised at how well the sticky-sweet teriyaki sauce went with the nicely browned chicken. The slightly more exciting sounding tofu gratin, on the other hand, was a letdown: beneath the blanket of cheese lay a gluey sludge that tasted how we imagine melted plastic would. Thankfully Ichiban's new Hawaiian maki, just one of the many innovative makis on offer, came next. The compact maki were topped with slices of smooth, pearly pink salmon, and a novel touch came in the form of apple mayonnaise and apple-flavoured masako (capelin roe) daubed on top. Refreshing and zesty, it made a successful, if slightly strange, combination.</p>
<p>Food might have been a little inconsistent, but service was prompt, with spillage being cleaned up in a jiffy. A tip: if you're having trouble combing through the very extensive menu, get recommendations from the head waitress - as we mulled over ordering yaki udon, she told us smilingly, 'We don't do that so well here.' Top marks for honesty, at the very least.</p>
<p>* * * (3 stars) <br />
Refreshingly honest</p>]]></description>

        <short-description><![CDATA[Restaurant Mama's Kitchen - This popular shop steps from Devi's Corner in TTDI is absolutely packed.....]]></short-description>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>This popular shop steps from Devi's Corner in TTDI is absolutely packed on weekends and does a pretty brisk business at lunch and dinner during the week as well. The friend who sent me here for the claypot loh she fun did so with a warning: 'Don't go really hungry, because your wait will probably be way looooong.' One way around the long wait is to go at an off hour; at 2:30pm on a Thursday the resto had few patrons.</p>
<p>I'm going to be frank and admit that I have an immediate dislike for any place where the waiter takes one look at my white face and then presumes to suggest what I would or wouldn't like to eat. Potato leaf with fermented bean curd, please. 'Really? Do you know what that is? Do you really think you can take that?' I do, and I do.</p>
<p>Quibbles aside, the service here is fairly prompt, if a bit befuddled. Potato leaf appeared on the table in the form of kangkong, which I sent back. The server returned with the kangkong to ask if I really wanted to send it back. Well yes, since I ordered potato leaf, I would. Happily, an order of Mama's famous loh she fun turned up just that, and it didn't disappoint. When it arrived the dish was burping heat bubbles through the layer of semi-crisped chopped pork that capped the dish of noodles. On top, a sunny-yolked raw egg sat waiting to be stirred in. Chopped meat is augmented with slices threaded through the noodles, which are predictably chewy in that semi-gluten-ish rice flour sort of way. For me the whole dish was a bit underseasoned, but that's easily remedied with a bit of soy from the bottle on the table.</p>
<p>As for those potato leaves, they did finally arrive, bathed in a creamy, slightly tartish fermented bean curd sauce and crowned with a mound of browned sliced shallots. Baby gailan was cooked to that clichéd but much appreciated crisp-tender stage, its vegetal greenness balanced by the sharp saltiness of super cruncy ikan bilis.</p>
<p>Mama's menu is extensive, covering a range of standard stir-fries, soups, and rice and noodle dishes. While not exactly upscale, the décor is a cut above your average open-air restaurant. Judging from the claypot loh she fun, further exploration might be warranted.</p>
<p>* * (2 stars)<br />
Okay lah</p>]]></description>

        <short-description><![CDATA[Sage Restaurant &amp; Wine Bar - Though Kuala Lumpur boasts its share of fine dining restaurants there.......]]></short-description>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Though Kuala Lumpur boasts its share of fine dining restaurants there have been none to whom I'd confidently take a food-focused friend visiting from San Francisco, Sydney, or Tokyo. Until now, that is. In terms of both overall dining experience and cuisine, Sage is on par with the best of what the rest of the world has to offer. It all comes down to the details.</p>
<p>Though sited within a shopping mall (The Gardens at Mid Valley), Sage feels like a standalone operation. Dark timber floors, taupe walls, blonde wood and sage accents, and vanilla leather chairs lend the main dining room an understated sophistication that would be at home in New York or Paris.</p>
<p>Tables are covered with white cloths and set well enough apart that private conversations need not be carried out with a whisper, and music (cool Brazilian tropicalismo, while we were there) is played at a decibel level that doesn't require shouting. No matter where in the room you're sitting the view is fine; to one side, floor-to-ceiling windows reveal a scruffy cityscape backed by green hills while to the other, sage and taupe mosaic tiles frame a pass way through to the restaurant's semi-open kitchen.</p>
<p>Greeted with a smile, although we arrived at 1:30pm without reservation, my dining partner and I were promptly seated by the window and served a welcome drink (a refreshing ginger beer-ish concoction). As we pondered the menu (for weekday lunch it's three courses for RM100, with a choice of appetiser, entree, and dessert) we nibbled at some excellent breads, served with a delicious cheese-free pesto-like basil and olive oil puree.</p>
<p>Our appetiser, pate of foie gras and young chicken bundled in thin-as-silk puff pastry and served in a puddle of rich demi-glace, set the tone for the meal, the barely-there, golden brown wrapper enclosing flavourful slices of bird moistened with the fat of the duck liver. Our entrees duelled for supremacy. My lovely square of sea bass, lightly seared and cooked just past the point of still-cool-in-the-middle, was crowned with a single pristine King Prawn and perched atop barely wilted spinach. All swam in a shallow pool of burnt orange tomato and fish stock reduction whose complexity of flavour brought to mind a long-simmered Nicoise bouillabaisse. Every element of the dish was so perfectly prepared it could have stood alone. Together they worked brilliantly.</p>
<p>Across the table my partner 'mmmmm'd' his way through a wonderfully tender, rare (cooked to order) piece of Angus beef accompanied by dauphinoise potato (each layer distinct, neither reduced to mush nor undercooked) and green beans tasting as fresh as if they'd been picked that morning (and perhaps they had). For this pepper lover the seasoning was, amazingly, just right. It's perhaps the first time I've eaten beef in a restaurant without wanting to grab for the salt shaker and pepper grinder.</p>
<p>For dessert, both sweet (a very-berry raspberry vacherin, served with raspberry sauce and a snow-white meringue that dissolved on contact with tongue) and savoury (two excellent Australian cheeses - a goat's milk brie and a cow's milk cheddar - with thin slices of toasted nut bread and fig paste) hit the mark. Two faultless macchiato closed a meal that I am still recalling with relish more than a month later. Throughout the meal service was consistently five star, friendly but not overly so and always to hand but not hovering.</p>
<p>All in all, an exceptional dining experience that had me practically floating out of the restaurant, wishing that a special occasion justifying a return was just around the corner.</p>
<p>* * * * * (5 stars)<br />
Just perfect<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

        <short-description><![CDATA[Tea &amp; Sympathy - You won't be getting tea and sympathy from anyone here, just clothes (and no accessories) ......]]></short-description>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>You won't be getting tea and sympathy from anyone here, just clothes (and no accessories). Eighty per cent of the stocks are sourced from Bangkok, and the remaining locally-made ones are designed by Naomi Lim, the store owner.<br /><br />
Although this rather bare store has limited items, it makes the shopping experience easier and decision making faster. Only three pieces are available for each simple, casual and easy-to-match design, and one piece for each dress as well as other complicated designs. Overall, expect to find baby doll tops, cocktail dresses, playful looking skirts, avant-garde jackets which remind me of Vivienne Westwood creations. Some clothes are designed in line with current trends and some are not. The cheapest items: casual, floral-print cotton tops (RM59), easy to mix and match. By and large, the store offers competitive pricing when compared to other nearby boutiques. <br /><br />
For some of Lim's own designs, she resorts to 1950s silhouettes - nipped at the waist and with a full skirt that accentuates the figure - and 1960s straight-cut shifts with long sleeves and mini-skirt hemline. All fabrics used are sourced locally or from Mumbai and Japan. Lim dislikes using chiffon and silk, citing them as cumbersome. She prefers stiffer materials like taffeta, bridal satin. Her favourite is made-in-Japan medium-weight cotton canvas which is ideal for Malaysia's humid weather. However, recommended are the cocktail dresses made from bridal satin, brocade and silk, and intricately made casual, cotton dresses. All come in muted colours to enable you to accessorise easily.<br /><br />
The store has recently introduced work shirts (RM195) designed by Sean, an indie designer from Bangkok. Made from cotton, polyester and cotton spandex, and with an emphasis on collar construction workmanship, the work shirts look a little avant-garde, with a hint of Victorian influence, and are not your usual staid office wear. Tea &amp; Sympathy has also received orders via its blog (style-taketwo.blogspot.com), from customers from Singapore, Jakarta and London. Local customers, meanwhile, can easily access the physical store and, among other things, enjoy free hemming services and request custom-made outfits (with three free trial fittings), only during off-peak periods between March and August. Custom-made clothes cost RM129 onwards.</p>]]></description>

        <short-description><![CDATA[Wine @ Nine - Who would have thought that wines and the pool bar concept would go well together? Well.........]]></short-description>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Who would have thought that wines and the pool bar concept would go well together? Well, for this, you have to give props to this nightspot. Thankfully not a greasy, stained, hole-in-the-wall joint, this place is rather clean and well maintained. The interior - lit by fluorescent lights - has no fancy decor or fixtures; instead all you'll find are five well maintained American pool tables (and some bar tables and chairs for customers to kick back) occupying the space within. Like a typical pool joint, the pace here is laid back where customers bond over shooting balls. Games can be had for RM21++ per hour. Unfortunately, if you're intending to spend hours playing pool, don't expect to get any discounts or rebates off the hourly going rate. Tough.<br /><br />
Where does the wine element fit into the scheme of things? Just head to the back section of the outlet where the small dedicated wine section is located. Over 50 wine labels from France, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and Chile, among others, are available for enthusiasts. Do note that you're only allowed to order by the bottle (costing RM80 upwards), and not glass. The exception is the house pouring (RM18++ per glass), with the variety of labels changed every two months to offer the novelty of the new. And on a monthly basis, you can also have the wine of the month deal at a special price (which varies according to the type of wine). Whatever it is, it's just as well the wines are sold by the bottle, as you can enjoy them with your friends over rounds of pool. Just make sure you stay sober enough to aim right when hitting the balls.<br /><br />
If the drinks are more your concern than the game, perhaps you'll want to take note of this deal: buy two bottles of wine and enjoy a five per cent discount when ordering the third bottle. For those who reckon that playing pool and having wine at the same time is just wrong - too fancy, or for pansies, perhaps? - be heartened to know that beer is also served here. If you use some common sense, you'll choose the right time to head over and enjoy the happy hours deal (daily, 4-8pm): RM70++ for two jugs (normal price RM40++ per jug). With the spare change, you can pay for an extra hour or two of pool. Besides, this is the main reason you're coming here in the first place.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Gazetted as a heritage building under the Antiquities Act, it's also one of the oldest theatres in the country. It is in the historic Sultan Abdul Samad Building, located at the junction of Jalan Tun Perak and Jalan Raja that is across the Merdeka Square, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p>
<p>It was built in 1896 and was completely finished in 1904. The theatre occupied the historical building of Old City Hall (Sultan Abdul Samad Building) of Kuala Lumpur. The theatre and old City Hall building was designed by a colonial-government architect, AB Hubback, who is responsible for designing most of the colonial building in Kuala Lumpur and other towns that right now became a historical heritage building landmark.<br /><br />
Built ideal for staging of productions from plays to musicals. The scene of the various successful productions through the years, the old theatre holds many fond memories for theatre lovers in the city.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Service is on-scene but not intrusive and the staff actually seem to know the menu. Everything leads to a leisurely meal with a hip-ish feel. There is little to quibble with on a menu with great balance and genuine thought behind it. Their daily specials, which always include a vegetarian option, are well worth a close inspection. <br /><br />
Many families come to this eatery because it is a child-friendly restaurant. With its white painted floors and walls, crisp white cloths covering well-spaced tables, modish chairs and cosy nooks defined by sheer curtains in hot colours, Bijou is as pretty as a jewel. Undoubtedly a hip restaurant and a big hit in the city's culinary scene.<br /><br />
The venue serves genuinely healthy and scrumptious food like Breadcrumb Pasta with chopped oven dried tomatoes stuffing and an outstanding lunchtime menu, it remains one of the best executed eateries around. Especially in this part of town.<br /><br /></p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>In a city with no shortage of respectable Japanese restaurants, Gonbei is perhaps the most spectacular. It's certainly a special occasion whenever you dine there, even if the feel is more rustic charm than the slick, contemporary lines more fashionably found at other hotel-based locations. <br /><br />
Gonbei's five counters offer diners a choice of how they want to eat, however, whether it's sashimi, teppanyaki or sushi, there is not so much a choice as a guarantee that the quality will deliver. One final accolade is to herald their sake as the most impressive in the city, perhaps the region.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>This Northern Indian restaurant at The Federal Kuala Lumpur hotel is a little hidden. For one, it is tucked away in a corner obscured by The Verandah coffee house. But its view, which opens out to the surprisingly peaceful tropical garden, makes up for it.<br /><br />
Food wise, it has everything you would expect of such a restaurant - Tandoori, Roganjosh Kashmiri (lamb cooked with Kashmiri masala), Matar Paneer (homemade cottage cheese and green pea curry), Nan and, of course, mango lassi.<br /><br />
On our initial visit, the dishes tasted milder than we had expected. But this is not to say that the food here is any less authentic. The spiciness - as in the variety of spices used - is still there and so this might be a good starting point for people who are less tolerant of the chilli kind of hotness but still want to enjoy Indian food.<br /><br />
The Murgh Mukhanwala (boneless chicken grilled and gently simmered in tomato, butter and cream) was smooth and creamy, and with just the right hint of spice. The level of spiciness in Machli Goa Curry (red snapper cooked in coconut, ginger, garlic and spices) was mellow as well which worked out fine because we could then taste the freshness of the fish.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>No, Maybank has not branched out into the food industry. This mamak has been around for a good four to five years and the reason why almost everyone calls it the Maybank mamak is because of its location: next to a Maybank branch in Seapark, PJ. The name is trivial; all you need to know is how to get there and what to order. This is where you'll find one of the best nasi lemaks in PJ. Maybank mamak used to be known for their iced milo drink as they come as concentrated as they can be. But that is a thing of the past. The drinks are not as good as they used to be but are still acceptable. Now their nasi lemak ayam is centre of attention. <br /><br />
Every KL-ite (Malaysians in general) will boast their knowledge of the best nasi lemak in town (or any other type of food for that matter). What sets this place apart from the other nasi lemaks in town is their sambal. Spicy, as it should be, but with a sweet tinge to create that balanced taste. The unassuming looking fried chicken has its batter to thank as its crispy skin complements its juicy chicken meat. Since not many enjoy or appreciate a runny egg, the yolk is cooked as it mixes with the rice, creating a flavour similar to fried rice. Mixing in the fried chicken, sunny-side-up egg and fragrant coconut milk soaked rice with the sambal, you'll get the perfect mouthful. An absolutely gastronomically sinful dish. Best of all, no matter what time you go, you'll be guaranteed a piping hot meal. <br /><br />
If you can brave the seating arrangements (right on the road with no protection from incoming cars) and the cleanliness of the place, you'll have a meal that will keep you coming back for more. Just try not to have too much on one visit. You won't feel so good the next day. If nasi lemak is not your thing, they also have the standard mamak fare. Just ask them for extra sambal. <br /><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Situated in one of the quieter shopping malls in town, Rakuzen is home to some of the better Japanese food in KL. A popular restaurant, you'll be lucky if you are immediately seated without a reservation, especially during dinner when the restaurant is packed. I waited 35 minutes for a table but it was worth it.<br /><br />
The restaurant is tastefully decorated with bamboo, giving it a relaxing and tranquil feeling. It is divided into a sushi bar section and the rest of the restaurant is divvied up into rooms with private booths of various sizes. Some of the booths have sliding doors which allow them to become private dining rooms, sealed off from the rest of the restaurant. There are often Japanese diners in the various booths on business dinners which speaks volumes for the quality of the food.<br /><br />
One thing that you will notice in Rakuzen is the extensive menu, with a variety of speciality dishes. What Rakuzen is known for, however, are their dragon rolls which are made with tiger prawns, fried tempura style and then wrapped in sashimi rice together with mayonnaise, topped up with roe and thinly-sliced avocado. Though you can find them in other Japanese restaurants in town, Rakuzen's are on a different level altogether. As soon as the pieces touch your tongue, you taste the freshness of the ingredients and the soft yield of the rice and avocado slices, before tasting the crispy tempura batter and the sweet flesh of the prawn. A visit here is simply incomplete without ordering this.<br /><br />
Also, a personal favourite of mine is the chawamushi. Not a fan of this dish elsewhere, I do like the Rakuzen version which is fresh and creamy without the slight fishy smell you find elsewhere. Once again, the freshness of the dish is impressive, a theme that repeats throughout the menu. From the tepanyaki and teriyaki, to the gyudon and soba, you will be hard-pressed to find fault with the dishes served. The service is also excellent, with the wait staff blending into the background, appearing only when you need them. Though the price is slightly on the pricier side, the quality of the food makes up for it tenfold. <br /><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Late last year Italian food scene stalwart Neroteca suffered a bit of an ownership shake-up. Fans of the charmingly laid-back local take on a classic Italian enoteca (wine bar offering food) will be glad to know that it hasn't translated into a change for the worse.<br /><br />
A recent lunch of simple but well-prepared standards left us feeling that some of KL's more high-falutin' restaurants could learn a thing or two from Neroteca about letting good ingredients speak for themselves. The antipasti plate for two was as good a version as we've had outside of Italy. Featuring a surprisingly abundant selection of seafood (not-too-salty cured anchovy fillets, spicy pepperoncini stuffed with tuna, slices of lovely silky smoked fish, fresh prawns, tender squid rings in a piquant tomato sauce, flakes of grilled fish), along with two varieties of olives and grilled and oil-preserved veggies, it made for the perfect accompaniment to slices from a pleasingly crusty, chewy loaf. <br /><br />
The Mediterranean salad, big enough for two to share was, as advertised, full of 'healthy' ingredients: grilled zucchini and eggplant, slices of red and yellow pepper, carrot, and asparagus. The curly leaf lettuce, we think, might be served a bit less dressed (read 'limp') and augmented with some of the fabulously perky arugala that crowns the antipasti.<br /><br />
Lunch calls for sandwiches and here Neroteca, drawing on a rich Italian heritage of things on and between bread, bats with the rest of them. The Tirolese, a piadini (think super-thin, very lightly toasted pizza dough) topped with gorgonzola, speck (a variety of cured ham most often associated with Alto Adige - the Tyrols, get it?), and arugala was by alternate bites salty-super creamy and blue cheese funky (as fans of stinky cheese we mean that in the best possible way), delightfully oozy to the end. <br /><br />
We'd recommend that Neroteca consider going a wee bit heavier on the pork fat for the homemade sausage stuffed into its grilled Campagnole panini (the meat was fantastically porky but a might dry), but we loved the flavourful and quality olive-oil rich eggplant caponata slathered on the bread. To minimize the possibility of grease-covered fingers the sandwich is served wrapped in paper, just the sort of attention to detail we can appreciate.<br /><br />
Though we arrived with the best of intentions (a thorough appetiser-through-dessert review) the most we could manage après sandwich was a couple of coffees. For the rich crema sported by our espresso we say, '<i>Grazie </i>very much.'</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Rating:</b> 4/5<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Neroteca is a finalist in the Time Out KL Food Awards 2009 Best Italian Restaurant category. The Time Out KL's food awards are 100% voted for by the people of KL. This way, we guarantee that popularity and consistent performance is rewarded.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Great, just what we need: another German bar in KL. But don't let your hang-ups prevent you from checking out Bayernhaus. In spite of being relatively new in the Klang Valley (it only opened in February), it's already set to introduce its brand of Oktoberfest in mid-September, and you can enjoy the 'seasonal' Oktoberfest beer offered here only once a year. Isn't this incentive enough for drinkers who're constantly seeking the novelty of the new to count the days and look forward to an orgy of boozers merrily toasting away in unison? Or if you're the sort who lives to drink for the moment, make your way here pronto, and enjoy the all-day-long happy hours (11.30am-11.30pm, daily except Sun). Just as well that Bayernhaus does not offer entertainment, as drinkers wouldn't give an arse about music; instead copious amounts of golden liquid can be had on the cheap(er) and that's what matters.<br /><br />
As Bayernhaus is the only outlet specialising in offering Paulaner beers (made using well water running underground the brewery in Munich, which explains the clear, distinct and crisp taste), I'd recommend the Wheat Beer Natural with a smooth taste. It's one of the few varieties served on tap (RM25+ per glass) from five-litre barrels (most other beer choices here are served in bottles). Notably, after downing it the brew doesn't leave bad breath as compared to the aftertaste of mass-produced lagers. Among all the Paulaner beer choices available here, the most potent (at 7.9 per cent alcohol content) is the Salvator (RM18+ per bottle). Don't let its light taste fool you; after the second round, it'll surely bring the red on the faces of unseasoned drinkers.</p>
<p>Another must-have is the 'seasonal' Hacker Pschorr Animator offered here once a year in March. Not many nightspots in Malaysia offer this, which is just too bad, as seasoned drinkers will surely enjoy its strong roasted malt flavour. <br /><br />
Thankfully some bottles of this are still available this month: the 500ml variety (RM25+) and the piece de resistance - the two-litre bottle (RM150+). If the latter is too much for you, order from the Thurn Und Taris Pilsener beer promotion this month and July. Buy four bottles (RM72+), get one free. Frankly, having five standard beer bottles or a two-litre bottle at a night-out here - what's the difference? Especially when you're known to drink like a fish or are dead set in getting sloshed at the end of the evening. So you're also advised to ask the bar's friendly staff about the occasional impromptu promotions offered here. That is, depending on availability of new beer stocks and shipments from Germany.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>For quite some time, working out in KL has meant sharing the gym with loads of other people whose motivation lies in getting laid rather than getting fit. Here's where GetActive comes in. It is a gym alright but there are no memberships.</p>
<p>To work out, you have to make an appointment with a personal trainer, who will supervise and guide you through a private session where you have the entire gym all to yourself. Otherwise, you can request an outcall where the trainer will see to your workout at home or at your condominium's gym.</p>
<p>With this arrangement, your trainer can easily tailor a fitness regime to suite your needs - whether it is to loose weight, buff up, prepare for an upcoming marathon, rehabilitate from an injury or simply to get that six pack to make your ex jealous.</p>
<p>The trainers at GetActive are qualified under the American Council of Exercise, and as such, they are equipped to train anyone from 14 to 80 years old. There is also a certified dietician on staff who is able to provide nutritional advice and counselling. Yes, they are that serious about health and fitness.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Silat, the art of fighting once exclusively taught only to the Malays, is now a widely practised martial art around the world, to places as far and varied as the US. One of the largest and most well-known silat style taught in Malaysia is the Silat Gayong.</p>
<p>The origin of Silat Gayong as taught by the late grandmaster and founder, Dato' Meor Abdul Rahman is from 'Silat Sendi Harimau' which means 'The Tiger's Joint Silat.' This is why characteristics of a tiger can be found in the style.</p>
<p><br />
Pusat Latihan Kajang Utama (PLKU - Kajang Utama Gayong Training Centre), is a dojo-style modern place of training. It is currently one of the biggest silat training centres in the Klang Valley, with more than 21 smaller gelanggang (venues) under it.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Unlike spas, which you probably save for that occasional indulgence, Siam Body Works is the kind of treat you could afford to get your tired body worked on every other week. Why wouldn't you when you can get a good hour of traditional Thai massage for only RM68?<br /><br />
Siam Body Works has been around for four years. During which, it has expanded from its initial outlet at Ampwalk to include two others in Northpoint Mid Valley City and Menara Hap Seng. That does say something about the quality of service here: you can't possible sustain that long and still expand if not for a loyal customer base, can you?<br /><br />
Siam Body Works offers a variety of Thai treatments ranging from traditional and herbal massages to aromatherapy and foot reflexology. Surprisingly, it also has a Golfers and Sports Massage.<br /><br />
The outlet I visited at Northpoint Mid Valley City felt like a familiar neighbourhood joint. It's a simple set up; unpretentious and friendly. The décor carries some Thai elements without being overly kitschy. The double height floor to ceiling glass walls let in lots of sunlight from the courtyard, giving the place an airy, cheerful and inviting ambience.<br /><br />
The only drawback is that there are no individual treatment rooms. You go into a large room and are separated from the next patron by a curtain. However, the outlet is roomy enough for them to space out the patrons in such a way that you feel as if you are the only one there. So that solves the problem, really.<br /><br />
My Thai masseuse did a good job of the traditional Thai herbal massage. She maintained a firm pressure throughout the 90-minute treatment (RM115) and paid close attention to my back when she discovered that it was particularly tense. She started with some body stretching just like any regular traditional Thai massage. This is mostly to relieve tension, back pain and muscle strain. Although it did feel like the lazy man's yoga, this massage is said to improve blood circulation, stimulate the lymphatic system and realign your musculoskeletal structure.<br /><br />
For the second part of the treatment she switched to a pressure point massage using a steamed pouch filled with turmeric, kaffir lime, camphor, lemongrass and pandan leaves. The heat was very soothing and I presume the herby concoction must be rejuvenating to the body. At the end of the session, I was no longer tired. In fact, I felt so light and happy that the congested traffic outside didn't bother me at all.<br /><br />
Outlets:<br /><br />
A-G-6, The Plaza, Northpoint Mid Valley City ,<br />
1, Medan Syed Putra Utara , 59200 Kuala Lumpur<br /><br />
Lot No. 1-04, 1st Floor, The Podium,<br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>As a Spanish-inspired bar, its decor surely does not reflect it. The interior looks more modern, illuminated by cool gauzy blue lights, and the place is lined with sofas comfortable enough to recline and enjoy drinks with friends. Forget about entertainment; there're no DJs and live bands performing here. And there're no future plans in introducing such attractions here. Instead you're expected to come and chill out, better still, order copious amounts of drinks.<br /><br />
The outlet has a variety of hard liquor, beers, cocktails, mocktails and more - you know, the standard bar fare. Perhaps more interesting are the Sangria (RM20++), available in red and white wines; the latter surprisingly tastes yummy, with a slight sweet aftertaste. The outlet's signature alcoholic Chulo Punch (RM9++ per glass), meanwhile, is concocted using secret ingredients that the bar owner would not reveal, but is potent and has a kick. Oh, there's also Honey Margarita (RM22++) which has a, well, slight honey flavour.  More of a ladies drink, if you ask me.<br /><br />
The waiters provide attentive service, but their command in English is sadly lacking. So you'll have to be a bit patient with them when ordering drinks.  While waiting for your orders, indulge in conversations with friends. There's no annoying blaring music in the background. When you're bored, head to the bar's upstairs, where the rooftop terrace, lined with sofas, is located. Ideal time to be here are in the evenings, to enjoy views of Jaya One (where this bar is located) and parts of Petaling Jaya, illuminated with lights, while sipping your drinks.  If you really need some distraction, take to the pool table here (RM3 per game). Otherwise there's really nothing much else to do except lepak. Don't worry about the rain; the terrace is equipped with a retractable canopy.<br /><br />
The Happy Hours deals (daily, 5pm to 10pm) here are nothing to shout about. Standard prices prevail: RM33++ (per jug of Tiger Draft) and RM50nett (for five bottles of Heineken).  Although, the outlet will be introducing absinthe to be served in shots glasses; in which case, the word 'potent' will surely be an understatement. Let's see who'll be the last man standing.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Regulars at Champs will be fuming when they see this review. It can be hard enough to secure a table outside this quaint little bar/restaurant in the evenings and on weekend afternoons, without promoting it in the pages of Time Out. Yet, is there really that much to recommend this simple, uninspiring, slightly drab outlet, upstairs in the seen-better-days Centrepoint shopping mall in Bandar Utama, hardly the centre of the nightlife or gastronomic world?<br /><br />
Well, yes, actually. The food really does pack a punch. It's tasty, it's fresh, and - critically - it's original. You see the big screen outside the front door, the small bar, ageing furniture and you make assumptions about the fare on offer. You only have to ask the regulars and they'll tell you how wrong those assumptions are. They'll enthuse about the steaks, they'll rave about the calamari chilli (spiced beer batter is the trick here, and what a mighty trick it is) and don't get them started on the 'Stinging Bacon'. <br /><br />
Here is a savoury treat unserved - and possibly unservable - elsewhere in the Klang Valley. Great bacon, dressed in wasabi and fried to a crisp. If there's a better bar snack in our jurisdiction I haven't heard about it. <br /><br />
It's a simple place, Champs. There are no heirs or pretensions here. They have a singer accompanied by a keyboard on Friday nights, they show live sport, they have a big neon sign outside. It was named after the owner's dog, for crying out loud. Individually these are not the hallmarks of a great eating establishment but at Champs none of that matters, as the quality of the food on offer supercedes all that.Just ask the regulars.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Korean isn't quite spur-of-the-moment food; diving into all that garlic and chilli requires a bit of advance planning. And whomever you plan to spend the rest of the post-meal day with had better partake with you, because you know what they say about garlic breath (it's best shared). But issues such as these needn't be considered if you're pondering a visit to Dorae Garden. Let's call it the perfect restaurant for those who want to eat Korean but don't want to smell like it for the rest of the day. <br /><br />
Don't be misled by the kickoff complimentary soup. Clear of broth and richly meaty, it's spicy enough to clear sinuses and set lips abuzz, but these sensations were not once repeated over the course of our recent lunch. Kimchi jigae, a flame-red stew packed with pork, chunks of kimchi, and soft bean curd was tasty, comforting, and certainly filling but left us waiting, in vain, for the fiery punch that Korean food is known for. In Korea, barbecue is where it's at, and Dorae does a good job prepping its meats for the grill. The restaurant's in-table 'cues don't get quite hot enough (or are not allowed to preheat long enough) to properly char the meat, but despite their necessarily long turn over the (fake) coals both bulgogi (sliced sirloin) and go chu jan sam kyb sal (thinly sliced pork) tasted fine, hinting at soy and sugar marinade, and were exceptionally tender. Extra salad leaves for wrapping are available on request and at no extra charge, and whole garlic cloves are heated in a bit of oil at the side of the barbecue to mellow (but not obliterate) their intensity. Unfortunately, however, the accompanying bean paste tasted mostly of salt and was curiously flat, devoid (again) of that characteristic Korean kick. <br /><br />
Perhaps the biggest 'eh' moment of our meal came when the panch'an (small dishes) were delivered. Kimchi and ggakdugi (cubed daidon given the kimchi chilli treatment) were fine, if on the mild side, and it's hard to go wrong with kong namul (cool blanched bean sprouts dressed with sesame oil), but fern shoots were mushy, pajeon (thin pancake of green onion) greasy and flabby, and the heavily mayonnaise-dressed macaroni salad just plain perplexing. Service is attentive, management obviously makes every effort to take care of its customers, and the restaurant's light-filled upstairs dining room is a pleasant spot in which to kick back (shoeless). But Dorae Garden serves Korean lite, fare that hints at the real deal but pulls back at the last minute. Perfect for the delicate palate, but a bit of a disappointment</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>The words 'family restaurant' are enough to make most of us run away screaming and Marco's, on the face of it, looks as hideous as most. Bright colours, faux-cheery staff, unimaginative menus, incongruous play equipment, Marco's has the lot. <br /><br />
However, that's exactly what a lot of parents want. And kids love it. The colours and décor are vibrant and the playcentre is safe and exciting for even young toddlers. But what makes Marco's a sound choice for lunch with your offspring is the food. <br /><br />
Fresh ingredients are competently cooked in simple, satisfying meals such as the hugely satisfying carbonara and tasty pizzas. That shouldn't need shouting about but, because you can't mess around when it comes to your kids, and the paucity of other options out there, Marco's deserves recognition as a family favourite.<br /><br />
Still, while they rule the roost over the array of fast food options that parents so regularly default to, those fresh ingredients and good cooking are no match for Marco's Bangsar Village neighbours across the road, FitFor2. There's a place which genuinely creates quality food with kids in mind. Marco's is too contrived and simplistic to challenge for that mantle. It is also a little disconcerting that a clearly family outlet has the sub-title 'Pizza, pasta, vino'. Two out of three isn't bad, I suppose.<br /><br />
But, to the hundreds of kids who love it and look forward to eating there each week, that doesn't matter. It's up the parents to control what their children eat and making the right decisions about their diet can be tough. Especially when they throw a tantrum when you refuse them their third serving of Chicken McNuggets that day. Marco's offers enough to set it alone and I'm not going to dissuade parents from choosing it over dining with Ronald the Clown or Colonel Sanders.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Fish head curry is a tricky dish to review. It's a personal thing; everyone's got their own likes and dislikes. So let me put it up front: I don't care for a fish head curry that's over-the-top lemak. I don't like a one-dimensional, generic 'curry' flavour. I like my vegetables. And though I'm a chili fiend, this is one dish that shouldn't be overwhelmed with heat; I don't want to leave the table with my mouth on fire.<br /><br />
Judged by these admittedly subjective standards, Bangsar Fish Head Corner's specialty is spot on. Apparently I'm not the only one in KL who thinks so; the place is packed out every single afternoon (if you're looking to indulge at dinner time, look elsewhere; the place is usually sold out of heads by 2pm). The fish heads are generously sized, with plenty of meaty 'shoulder' attached. The gravy is thinnish and, while rich with coconut milk, not so stodgy as to make you wish for a nap after lunch. There are a multitude of flavours at work here: the bite of chillies, the freshness of curry leaves, the sweetness of cardamom and coriander seeds, the astringent pungency of cumin. They're all detectable, because the curry's chili heat comes through in the form of a tingle rather than a torrent. Underneath it all is a fair bit of tamarind sourness that melds the coconut milk and spices into one beautiful balanced whole. I would welcome a few more ladyfingers and tomato slices per serving of fish head, but extras are available on request.<br /><br />
The menu isn't what you'd call extensive. There's fish head, of course, and to go with it, rice and plain blanched bean sprouts. (The latter work nicely with leftover gravy.) Folks also queue here for fried chicken (crispy outside, moist within, well-seasoned, and always piping hot thanks to steady demand) and turmeric-marinated, deep-fried squid, served without the frills: it's whole, unpeeled, 'wings', head, and guts intact, plopped unceremoniously on a plate leaking a pool of own golden, tender and tasty. It's a talent of artistic measure, really, to be able to plunge a squid into boiling oil and know the exact moment to remove it, right after rubbery flesh turns gelatinous and just before the rubber reappears. And it's a talent the cooks here have mastered well. In the mornings there's no fish head, but plenty of roti and curry. And that's it. What more does any man (or woman) really need?</p>]]></description>

His kitchen is surprisingly small but from tiny acorns and all that, as he produces simply stunning creations, using natural, delicious ingredients. The seafood is exquisite, the wagyu beef top drawer and the lamb arguably the best in KL. Max also boasts a wine list better than a restaurant that size would normally command. But the real treat and what makes Max among the city's top food outlets is when he goes 'off menu'. <br /><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Unusual though halal dim sum is, it's certainly healthier and, as in the case of the offerings here at China Treasures, it loses nothing in terms of flavour for not featuring pork. <br /><br />
China Treasures may not be very well known but it offers excellent special menus and has rapidly established itself as one of the top Chinese restaurants in the Klang Valley. The crowds tell their own story. <br /><br />
The vennue also serves great pau, a light and delicious wu kok and their Peking duck is lovely, served either skinned and in rolls or sliced with noodles. Prices are also very reasonable.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>This place, packed out most lunches, dinners, and all day weekends, offers a lot of choice. Among the most popular stalls are Albert Thun Famous Beef Noodles and Penang Famous Prawn Mee. The former serves a delectable dry beef noodle (go for the thick round rice noodles); ask for an addition of beef fillet, which boasts the tenderness of meat that's been lovingly stewed for days on end. <br /><br />
The delicious prawn mee, nearly on par in terms of quality with what you'll find in Penang, features a rich prawn-and-pork broth and perfectly cooked shellfish and meat that slides right off the bone, and comes with fiery sambal. Paramount's chee cheong fun vendor consistently sells out of his Penang-style product by 12.30pm - always a good sign. Come early and bring along a good appetite.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>The number of Middle Easterners dining at Andalus suggests its offerings are sound. Appetisers houmous, tahini, fetoush (a tart mixed salad with crispy pita bread 'croutons'), and tabbouleh are all tasty (pita comes in an unattractive plastic bag, but it does help to keep the bread soft), and kebabs are smoky and moist. Stews, including a sweet-and-savoury prune and lamb dish cooked with the Moroccan kitchen staple preserved lemons, are also worth a try.</p>
<p>For some, Andalus might be a place that serves good food, but to some, Andalus is also known as a shisha haven. With a big screen tv, Andalus gives a very homey vibe as it is originally a double-storey house turned into a restaurant. Now that's what we call awesome!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Sick of paying overseas or hotel prices for good Japanese food? Kirishima is the place for you. The setting is airy with typical light wood furnishings and cool relatively private booths. The food meanwhile - especially the fish, delivery day for fresh fish being Tuesdays and Fridays - is excellent.</p>
<p>The only possible complaint being that the menu is somewhat unimaginative. Still, if you value quality over innovation, Kirishima is a restaurant that allows you to enjoy good Japanese dishes in a city centre location, for less than any of its hotel-based peers, and with no noticeable drop in quality.   <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Kirishima is a finalist in the Time Out KL Food Awards 2009 Best Japanese Restaurant category. The Time Out KL's food awards are 100% voted for by the people of KL. This way, we guarantee that popularity and consistent performance is rewarded.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>The top Arabic restaurant in KL, just a stone's throw from the bustling shopping and tourist district of Bukit Bintang, Sahara Tent is aptly found over the road from 'Ain al-Arabia'. It is everything that you would want in a Middle-Eastern restaurant. The ambience and décor are genuine, if slightly aged, with seating indoors and out. But the reason the Tent deserves its spot on this list is the brilliance of its food. Chicken and lamb dishes are mouth-meltingly tender and the selection of dips and accompaniments without exception superb. They claim that 90 per cent of their diners are from Saudi Arabia, which tells its own story about how authentic and respected Sahara Tent is.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Although Pacific Regency has some staples of a regular hotel such as a lobby, (Luna) bar and restaurant, it still comes across as more of a serviced apartment - which is why I wouldn't have guessed that it has a massage/spa centre until quite recently.<br /><br />
To its credit, the name 'Massage Corner' doesn't make any pretensions because the outlet really is small. There is only one room for Thai massage and another couples' room (which can be split into two individual curtained rooms when needed) for those who prefer aromatherapy, hot stone and Javanese massages. The décor has nothing much to shout about but it does the job of being simple, comfortable and relaxing. On the plus side, Massage Corner uses products from the famous Thai spa and beauty brand 'Harnn &amp; Thann'.<br /><br />
I took the Indulgence Package (RM200), which is a two-hour treatment consisting of a full body Javanese massage, foot reflexology and ear candling. However, on my visit, they ran out of ear candle and so I was treated to a 90-minute massage instead, followed by a half-hour foot reflexology.<br /><br />
Javanese massage is a medium to strong deep tissue oil massage believed to be a tradition among Javanese royalties. It uses palm and thumb strokes to ease tensed and tired muscles. Sensing that the muscles on my shoulders and back were all knotted up, my masseuse paid extra attention to alleviate them, which made the treatment more therapeutic than I had expected. This sort of deep pressure massage is good for a really tired achy body, and as a post-sport or post-heavy travelling relief. The massage oil used was quite an invigorating one, infused with oriental herbs such as lemongrass, lime and ginger.<br /><br />
Since I was already on the massage table, the foot reflexology session was carried out with me lying down - even though there is a small section with plush lounge chairs for this particular treatment. The foot reflexology is more Thai style than your regular Chinese ones so they are slightly milder. <br />
Admittedly the menu is limited, just like the space it occupies, but Massage Corner is worthy if all you are looking for is a good, no-frills massage. <br /><br /><br />
Level 22, Pacific Regency, Menara Panglobal, Jalan Punchak, Off Jalan P Ramlee, KL (03 2332 7233/www.pacific-regency.com). Open daily, 11am-11pm.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Are you prepared to spend big bucks for luxury fashion? Especially in the current economic downturn? Just don't ask the posh people at Max Mara, where its biggest store in Asia has recently opened. Offering all of the brand's sub-collections under one roof, the most arresting - in terms of design and price tag (above RM4,000) - is the Piano Forte Elegante line of eveningwear. Definitely not for the faint hearted, especially if you're paying premium prices for the dresses' impeccable finishing, embroideries, and tailoring construction - all using expensive fabrics like duchess satin, silk and fur.<br /><br />
Don't have the cash to make a big splash? Still be prepared to pay over RM1,000 for a fey-looking top from the Weekend line which I spotted; it has dainty floral prints and is made from delicate silk-chiffon-like material. Other lines, such as the more vibrant 'S MM; the athletic Sportmax Code; the street-inspired Sportmax; the silhouette-focused Studi"; and the more formal Max Mara are worthy of your attention (and wallet). Besides the designs, they carry the 'Made in Italy' label prominently stitched on the clothes and accessories like a badge of honour. Also justifying the high prices is that all fabrics used are made specifically for Max Mara. Silk and jersey materials are used every season for all the aforementioned collections. However, don't hold your breath for It-items; the brand doesn't believe in flavour-of-the-season styles but prefers to offer classic designs overall.<br /><br />
Regardless of the large 3,700-square-foot store space, it feels comfortable perusing the racks. The sales staff are friendly and will gladly give you a run-through of the season's offerings. The store's good service extends to offering a VIP room which all customers (and not only VIPs) can use for privacy during fittings. The room is equipped with an Italian coffee machine for more of that personal touch, and a private seamstress is made available for free alteration services (taking three days to a week).<br /><br />
Free delivery can also be made within the Klang Valley upon request and availability of products. If the size of something you fancy is not available, the store can make a special order for you. Waiting time is less than two weeks. There are also tentative plans to offer discount for purchases made in March using the CIMB and Amex Platinum credit cards. With so much to see and spend - what with the high prices - beware of not overheating the plastics in your wallet. Tan Hee Hui<br /><br />
Max Mara 3.30 &amp; 3.31, Level 3, Pavilion KL, Jalan Bukit Bintang (03 2148 2822). Open daily, 10am-10pm.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Neither overpoweringly rich nor overtly spicy like Szechuan, Canton fare is best described as everyday food, the kind you can eat and enjoy on a day to day basis. Hilton's Chynna restaurant echoes that sentiment by offering traditional Cantonese fare that is trans fat-free and with no MSG, which is a welcome change as far as Chinese cuisine goes these days.<br /><br />
But being stuck in a five-star hotel, Chynna nevertheless tries to set itself apart from its competitors by adding more value to their meal (and their price) by offering theatrics such as a resident herbalist, tea-master, musicians and calligrapher. However I was on official business, namely to try out the restaurant's new menu by Chef Lam Hock Hin, Chynna's Chef de Cuisine.<br /><br />
First up on the menu was the highly recommended braised sliced Alisan abalone with duck leg confit with abalone essence (RM98.00 per person). Hardly true blue Canton fare, the dish was served in a western setting, however, the essence of the abalone carried the smokey taste of the braised duck leg well without overwhelming the dish.<br /><br />
I then opted for a trio of dishes and a traditional serving of rice, starting with the marbled goby (soon hock) in miso and seaweed broth (RM25 per 100gm), wok-fried baby French beans in belacan sauce (RM28), steamed soft beancurd with minced chicken &amp; teo chew peanut sauce (RM28).<br /><br />
Of the three the fish came off a little bland but at least I knew it was not peppered with MSG. The Deep-fried seaweed in Japanese soy bean broth gave the dish a new spin although a bit more ginger would have completed the dish. I give top marks for the wok-fried beans and beancurd as both dishes gave the meal a welcome spicy feel (I am Malaysian after all) and although it wasn't spectacular, I was glad that the Chef kept the preparation simple.<br /><br />
For dessert I opted for a simple and refreshing hot almond tea with glutinous black sesame dumpling (RM9) that finished the meal off rather well. And that's really how I would sum up the Chynna dining experience- rather well. With the ambience, food and theatrics thrown in, Chynna comes across somewhat similar to a Kobe or Wagyu steak. You want to try it, you're glad you did but deep down you know it's only consumed for special occasions. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Chynna was voted the Best Chinese Restaurant in the Time Out KL Food Awards 2009. The Time Out KL's food awards are 100% voted for by the people of KL. This way, we guarantee that popularity and consistent performance is rewarded.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>A stone's throw from the traffic of Jalan Tun Razak, Rama V is a welcoming and quiet oasis in the middle of the city. Set in an old-style bungalow the lived-in appeal and relaxed approach here maintains a serenity that belies its city centre location.</p>
<p>Staff are very friendly and the Thai food is a cut above the norm. Order at least one of the green, red or yellow curries and make a date with the dried beef and red chilli sauce starter. And if you're confused with the names of the food, ask their friendly staff for guidance.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Yes. The jewellery shop. Recently opened in Pavilion, The C.Club (The Carat Club) serves 24-carat food. The menu is mostly western, with tasty steaks, fish, lamb, and pasta dishes. They also have Malaysian twists (such as the salmon starter smoked on pandan leaves) and regardless of the quality and luxurious setting, the prices will not completely break the bank.<br /><br />
Check out higly recommended dishes like grilled fillet of beef with wasabi and sea urchin, prepared with broccolini and tempura shimeji mushroom; lemongrass and rosemary marinated lamb loin with pumpkin roesti, jumbo asparagus and tomato and roasted garlic glace; and the pan seared salmon "rossini" on oxtail stew, topped with foie gras and balsamic palm sugar glace.<br /><br /><i>pork-free</i></p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Relish has been in KL now for over two years, during which time it has firmly established itself as one of the most famous and enjoyable places to go for food.</p>
<p>Solely responsible for importing the concept of 'gourmet burgers' to KL from London, they provide a range of pastas, pizzas, salads, etc, but it really is all about the burgers. And the best of the bunch is the 'Aussie' with beetroot, pineapple, onion, tomato, and various other sauces and trimmings.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Iketeru's signature style combines traditional elements of Japanese cuisine with the latest Tokyo nouveau, so don't be surprised to taste hints of red wine or balsamico in the well-prepared dishes. <br /><br />
Japanese restaurant Iketeru may be a regular on the prestigious TOKL Food 40 list but when they announced that they were organising a Weekend Champagne Brunch promotion, we just had to venture on for another look. Located in the Hilton KL, Iketeru is renowned for its Japanese fare but with by putting in a ChampagneBrunch spin on it now, Iketeru has just found an added hook to reel in diners to its establishment. Just like other hotel restaurant outlets in the city that offer this bubbly affair during weekends, Iketeru also boasts a never ending supply of Gosset Champagne ever readily topped up and served at your table. <br /><br />
The menu however priced at RM198 ++ (RM98++ for food only without champagne) may seem steep but it's a small price to pay considering the array of Japanese fare on offer together with a never ending supply of Gosset. Also unlike other establishments in the city that offer 'Bubbly Brunch', the Japanese restaurant allows you to enjoy your tipple and the ambience in a relaxing atmosphere by offering over 100 items available via ala carte. <br /><br />The tailor made menu consists of contemporary and traditional Japanese fare with an array of sushi, sashimi, teppanyaki, tempura as well as desserts which can be ordered as much to your heart, or should we say stomachs' content, up to five items at one time per table of course. Iketeru's Master chef Ricky-san's menu emphasises a lot on freshness and its none more evident by the delectable salmon, white tuna sashimi, sushi rolls and soft shell crab which we chose to start our meal with. <br /><br />
Subsequent dishes made up of prawn teppanyaki and tempura bared similar hallmarks of Iketeru's signature style of combining traditional elements of Japanese cuisine with the latest Tokyo nouveau. And having a serving of that with corpus amounts of champers is just too good to be true, especially on a weekend.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Like all good things inspired from the land of the Etruscans, this fable has the twin elements of la dolce vita: food and love.<br /><br />
It's the tale of a raven haired maiden (Carol Lim) who, peering over the fence from her village of Frangipani, stared as the dashing cook (Andreas Zanella) in the nearby village of Nerovivo made his handmade pastas, giggled as Zanella looked begrudgingly at his daily selection of mushrooms, and watched him shepherd his village to greater acclaim amongst the visitors to this part of Tuscany in KL. Kind of. These two would-be Latin luminaries were from different clans but the mutual admiration was undeniable. <br /><br />
Soon they ran away, two romantics whose connection was bound in axiom that food is love. And boy, did they ever love Italian food. They formed their first restaurant in KL and while that was successful, their wanderlust pushed them on. <br /><br />
They found home at a small space behind the Hotel Istana on Jalan Bedara, a location that formerly housed a French restaurant. They set about redesigning and redecorating, deploying fashionable concrete along the walls, installing a wood burning oven, lining the walls in pin yellow lights which cause a green phosphorescent effect to appear.<br /><br />
The front of the eatery is all glass which, together with the long bar, gives the place an Edward Hopper 'The Nighthawks' type ambience. Besides the omission of taking out the drop ceiling (a worthy new year's resolution if ever there was one as the incongruency of the ceiling is somewhat off-putting, to be honest) the physical glow of their new abode is palpable. Eight months old and Chiaroscuro Trattoria Pizzeria, their labour of love, is pulling in a solid dining public. <br /><br />
They've received laurels for their pizzas, a definite strong suit, but the breadth of the menu is varied, well executed and immaculately prepared. Their parma ham and melon is very good and a buffalo mozzarella with warm eggplant 'parmigiana' delicious. Minimalist al dente risottos and homemade fettuccine with cepe mushrooms and parma ham abound but it is the meats, one an Australian lamb rump cut and the other a Wagyu beef rump 'tagliata' style, that deserve special praise.<br /><br />
Both tender and carefully manicured under flame they are some of the best I've had so far in the city. With an exclamation mark of their own cylinder tiramisu and an artfully presented pannocotta, Chiaroscuro is one place I'm looking forward to frequenting again. Love, as they say, is in the air.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Shanghainese dumplings and noodles, or more specifically la mian, have become quite popular in KL. Now, there's a new outlet at The Gardens Mid Valley serving these delicious specialities. With branches in Beijing, Shanghai, Singapore and Jakarta, the Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao outpost in KL may not be a big outlet but its menu is certainly extensive. <br /><br />
There are set meals starting from RM16.80, which is rather affordable. But do try the dim sum as well, such as the pan-fried pork bun and fried pancake.</p>

 Despite Vintry's quiet location at the residential neighbourhood of Medan Damansara, the restaurant is buzzing with life.                                



</p>
<p>It has quite an extensive wine cellar where you choose your bottle to dine with. The wines are affordable, the food is great (they are known for their pork dishes) and the ambience is intimate but casual.<br /><br />
Look forward to a pork-heavy menu featuring a variety of tapas, from deep fried pork strips, crispy roast pork to honey fried cheese. However, if you're serious about trying something good, go for Vintry's sweet, crispy and yes, very sinful cameralised roast pork. Ambience here is intimate but casual, wines are affordable and food is great.</p>

<p>With dishes like tom yam, red curry and pineapple fried rice, one would probably be too full to try their desserts. So be sure to starve yourself before dining in Celadon to experience a full blown meal. Wondering about the price? Good news people! Its affordable, reasonable and most of all, worth spending for.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Brilliant health-conscious and nourishing food find in The Gardens at Mid Valley. We've already worked our way through half the massive menu (some local, some western) and everything has been completely and utterly brilliant, with extra-special mention to the spaghetti carbonara, organic pumpkin soup and cooked breakfast.</p>
<p>We can't wait to work our way through the other half. Also, great for kids and for you. And even more impressive, all the food, even the pasta, is freshly made on site.</p>

With a various range of food to choose from, braised Australian lamb shank, home smoked short ribs, crusted N.Z. lamb racks just to name a few, Las Carretas offers delicious desserts as well.

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Restoran Sate Kajang Haji Samuri H Ideally situated in the unofficial satay capital of Malaysia, Restoran Haji Samuri offers some of the best local delicacies, ranging from the standard chicken and beef to alternative varieties like deer meat, rabbit, fish and even tripe.</p>
<p>For a place that serves satay, this restaurant is actually clean and well-organised. Their satays are arranged in an orderly manner and their workers are well-dressed. Their satay is grilled in the right temperature and has a bit of that juicy burnt taste but since the meat is marinated perfectly, it makes the satay tastes superb. In addition to that, the sauce that comes with the satay tastes splendid and some might say that its one of the best.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Beginning to establish itself as the high-end Malay restaurant par excellence in the city, Enak sits unpretentiously in the lower ground floor of Starhill Gallery.</p>
<p>But despite this snazzy location, the food is fairly priced and more importantly, rich, tasty and authentic.</p>
<p>From the subtle to the intense, to spicy, sweet or savoury, every Enak KL dish is pretty unique. This may not be to everybody's palate though. The seafood is unquestionably the best way to begin exploring the menu but it's worth a few visits before settling on your favourites.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>As the name suggests, people flock to this restaurant for one thing only - crab. The signature sweet and sour crab is so good that you might want to order some bread to soak up the gravy. A guarantee here is the freshness of the crabs, and you can look forward to sweet and tender flesh. However, if you're looking for variety, prepare to be disappointed. The crabs on the menu are cooked only in two styles, with the first being sweet and sour and the latter steamed, but both are fantastic. For non-crab dishes, try the tofu salad and the butter prawns. For appetizers, do indulge and satisfy your taste buds with their chicken satay or their fried chicken wings.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>This shop does a fine thosai and an admirable idli, but the real draw here are the northern-style chat (snacks) served only after 4pm. The puri (small hollow puffs of rice filled with yogurt or paneer cheese or chickpeas, topped with crispies and doused with a chilli-tamarind-mint sauce) are a fantastic meld of tastes and textures. Fruit salad sounds dull but dazzles with its fiery mint-cilantro dressing.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Part of the succesful Delicious group, Reuinion caters great Chinese cuisine. Reunion's décor is all shiny surfaces and subtle lighting; very serious - and so is the food. And for such a classy joint, Reunion does hawker fare very, very well. <br /><br />
The Hokkien mee here rivals any you could find at a streetside stall, and the roast pork is absolutely sublime. And don't forget to save some room for dessert, because you don't want to miss out on the in-house tong yuen. One caution: no such thing as walk-in customers, remember to reserve a table or you're likely to be turned away at the door.<br /><br />
Ideal for those family meals that need somewhere a little special, although the price is by no means prohibitive.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Still maintaining its quality and inventive progress, Lafite after many years still remains a top player on KL's fine dining scene. The decor remains intimate and classy despite the many years Lafite has been around. The service remains impeccable especially with the arrival of the exquisite and smiling Rini as floor manager. Attention to detail both in the food and the service is at a very high standard for Malaysia and despite the high evening prices (sorry, we always moan that five-star hotel restaurants in KL are over-priced) the set lunches with the unending variety of samplers both for starters and dessert are a steal and a must visit for any wallet.<br /><i><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>You probably have meetings day in, day out, and have a u-shaped hollow at that interminable meeting table. Just to change things up a bit, the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre has unveiled TenOnCall, a new space at which to hold short-notice meetings in the city centre. They boast lemongrass drinks and scented towels (Try not to get too excited, will you?) in ten rooms on the fourth floor. <br /><br />
TenOnCall's rooms can accommodate meetings of up to 150 people on same-day notice, and for your money come complete with the use of audio-visual equipment and a technician, free wireless internet, a 'fancy' LCD sign greeting your people at the foyer and gourmet food and beverages. Meetings don't get much sexier than that. Sadly. <br /><br /><i>- Emma Chong</i></p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>As my dining companion and I entered Restaurant Tanjung Bunga hands clutching chop sticks stopped mid-air, heads swivelled in our direction, and the room went silent. Ill-at-ease as it made me feel I took it as a good sign, an indication that whatever we ordered would be cooked for Malaysian, rather than our own (foreign) palates.<br /><br />
This place is an open secret among fans of Penang-style Nyonya fare. The restaurant's owner hails from the northern state and his restaurant's walls sport Nyonya flourishes like carved wood-framed mirrors. But you don't come to fluorescent-lit Tanjung Bunga for the décor. As the multi-generational family groups crowded around each and every table at Sunday noon attest, you come here solely for the food.<br /><br />
The perut ikan (<i>pic</i>) is in a class of its own. This Nyonya classic is made with preserved garoupa stomach, but it's an ingredient that lends more flavour than recognizable taste or texture; if I hadn't told you it was in there you'd never know. This beguiling sweet, sour, chillispicy, and fish-flavoured mixture of pineapple, brinjal, long bean, and bamboo shoot is almost a curry. Coconut milk smoothes its tongue-tingling rough edges, lime leaf imbues it with a citrusy perfume, and daun kesom lends a pleasing astringent pepperiness. The love-it, hate-it push-pull essence of its murky moss-hued depths will appeal to anyone who's ever carried a torch for assam laksa.<br /><br />
Less complicated but no less delicious is the restaurant's joo hoo char: sautéed strips of cuttlefish, carrot, yam bean (jicama), cabbage, and dried mushroom eaten wrapped in lettuce leaves with a dab of sambal belacan. After you've downed a filled leaf note the hint of five-spice that lingers on the back of your palate. As lovely to look at as it is to eat is the nasi ulam, or rice mixed with a bracing mix of chopped and slivered fresh herbs like mint, basil, and ginger flower and showered with toasty kerisik (dry-fried coconut). Do hope that paku, delicate wild fern tips with a flavour reminiscent of asparagus, are in season. The kitchen blanches and then tosses them with lime juice, coconut, shallots, and a hint of belacan to make a refreshing salad.<br /><br />
The fish head curry gracing every single table except ours (we were just two, after all) suggests that it would be worth organising a group before tackling Tanjung Bunga's extensive menu. Desserts include an excellent cendol made with high-quality dark and smoky gula Melaka (palm sugar).</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>The Wasabi Bistro has never had the most elegant of entrances. On exiting the elevator one often thinks one has stumbled wrongly into the Mandarin car park but beckoning staff are more often than not there to put you right. The decor is a sombre and uninspired affair made no better by no natural light. Nowadays with so many well designed modern Japanese restaurants based on starkness with style Wasabi excels with the former but comes unstuck with the latter.<br /><br />
However, I have been here many times so there must be a reason for my loyalty other than the fact it's only yards from my workplace. Looking over the menu I notice there are a few new additions of a more modern take. Wasabi in the past for me was a straightforward, no nonsense, run-of-the-mill Japanese. Never excelling but always dependable.<br /><br />I opt for tuna carpaccio in a yuzu lime pepper dressing which is pretty good, reminding me of Nobu's famous yellowtail with jalapeno. Delicate and tasty but with a sting in the tail. I'm impressed. I finished my homage to health, guilt-free seaweed salad, which was as good as lettuce and seaweed can get I guess, but let's face it, is never going to match the delights of a combination of bubbling boiling oil and chicken, is it?<br /><br />
The tori-tatsuta-age (marinated deep fried chicken) was piping hot, crisp and succulent. Feeling a little more daring with the pepper still lingering on my tongue from the tuna carpaccio dressing I chanced upon the dynamite roll. To be honest I forget the contents because they didn't matter. The important thing was the dynamite or indeed the spice. <br /><br />
Cagily I had opted for heat level 10 in the 1 to 19 scale of mouth furnace options. Going by the wonderful fieriness of the six cut pieces I had narrowly missed out on a lobotomy by spice by not venturing into the teens but will soldier on to 11 or 12 on my next visit.<br /><br />
Being a degenerate curry eater and loving the mildness and flavoursome Japanese variety I ordered the vegetable Japanese Curry. Alas! It was no longer on the menu. However, no sooner had I drowned my sorrows in more hot sake the chef had whipped one up off menu and within minutes. It was excellent. All in all the food is very good at Wasabi probably nearly on par with Iketeru at the Hilton or Zipangu at the Shangri-La but the decor lets the overall experience down. However with a chef that clearly has ambitions, excellent service and maybe a face lift in the near future Wasabi is still a commendable establishment.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Yes, Bangsar Seafood Restaurant is still there. It's just hidden from plain sight behind the car showroom. The restaurant has recently been given a face lift. One corner of the restaurant has been turned into a water garden, where you dine on glass counters with water flowing through them. It's quite a soothing feature.<br /><br />
Since it is a Chinese seafood restaurant, we had to order the crabs. Despite its name, the baked crab in butter sauce, which is the house speciality, is actually cooked with margarine and milk. The addition of curry leaves and chilli padi gives the salty, buttery sauce a spicy edge, which makes it very appetising. Definitely a nice compliment to the big fleshy mud crabs. We recommend you order a serving of buns (the fried ones preferably) to soak up the sauce.<br /><br />
If you prefer something with a simpler taste so that you can fully appreciate the freshness of the crab, the steamed garlic crab on glutinous rice would be a good choice. The presentation is beautiful - a luscious red crab sits on a bed of glutinous rice in a bamboo steamer. We can't help but think of a giant crab lo mai gai. The rice is very fragrant and coupled with the sweet<br />
flesh of the crab, this could easily be a meal by itself.<br /><br />We particularly enjoyed the crispy duck with mixed herb flavour. It smells really good. The tender flesh and the slightly salty herbal taste can be quite addictive, especially when you dip it in that thick soy sauce. Both the bamboo shoots and asparagus in light Qi Zi sauce, and Chinese marrow rings stuffed with prawns, are commendable for their lightness. They are good for cleaning the palate after those full flavour dishes.<br /><br />
For dessert, we had the durian tempura, or rather, I personally had all the four pieces in that one serving. However, rather than the actual durian flesh, the filling is made out of authentic durian cream that is prepared from the flesh. Good enough for me. The boiled Lin Chee Kang, which is filled with chewy bits such as dried longan, lotus seeds, barley and white fungus, makes a refreshing end to a heavy meal.<br /><br />
While Bangsar Seafood Restaurant is not revolutionary by any measure, it still is a good spot for a casual family dinner.<br /><br />
There is nothing painfully overwrought on the menu here; every effort is made to serve good food on your plate. The worst you could call it is unsurprising, but we don't all want to be surprised when we go out to eat. Most of the time, we just want dinner. The type of seafood you'll find here is fresh, simple and the type where you lick your plate clean - which is the best kind of compliment we can give.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Bangsar Seafood Restaurant is a finalist in the Time Out KL Food Awards 2009 Best Seafood Restaurant category. The Time Out KL's food awards are 100% voted for by the people of KL. This way, we guarantee that popularity and consistent performance is rewarded.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>In terms of value for money you can't ask for more than you receive at this café-cum-restaurant. The portions are generous, the service is great and the price remains low. No wonder The Canteen Room is always packed.<br /><br />
There may be better eateries with more glamourous dishes around the town but I struggle to think of many with such consistency and reliability. And when it comes to lunchtime, especially, I think most people are like me: we'd rather not take a risk in what we order. If we know something is going to taste good, be served quickly and there's plenty of it, we'll go for that over an unknown quantity every time.<br /><br />
The best of The Canteen Room is evidenced in their huge, spicy Penang char kway teow, packed with tasty treats. Or, depending on who you listen to, their speciality, the asam laksa nyonya. Other dishes worth 'honourable mentions' include the prawn mee and chicken curry. While the latter doesn't use the best quality chicken, the divine gravy more than makes up for it, and what do you expect for less than ten ringgit?<br /><br />
The Canteen Room earns its three stars as much for its value as its quality. Oh, and the attentive, fast and helpful staff gets a round of applause!</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Kinnaree Thai restaurant won't win awards for originality. Décor plays upon well-trod Thai tropes (gold wall stencils; bhodhi tree images; dark timber and silks in eye-catching colors, heavy silver cutlery and lovely ceramic serveware) and the extensive menu includes all the usual suspects (pad thai, banana blossom salad, chicken in green curry, tom yam gong). This is, of course, not in and of itself a bad thing; Thai food enthusiasts looking for the familiar will feel right at home here.<br /><br />
It's hard to go wrong with the do-it-yourself appetiser mieng kham, and Kinnaree's boasts crispy wild pepper leaves, prawns both fresh and dried, minced pickled cucumber instead of the usual chopped lime, and a tasty if very sweet coconut cream-based sauce. Sweet and coconuty also describes the yam huaplee (banana blossom salad), which features plump shrimp and pleasingly crispy shreds of flower. Phuek tod (deep-fried mini pyramids of mashed taro) are oily-soggy and served with a sweet plum sauce. Better here would have been the slightly tart chilli-and-fish sauce dip that arrived with the calamari we didn't order but dove into, thinking it was the taro (Kudos to the restaurant for acknowledging its mistake and comping us the dish). One of our party pronounced the pad thai ordinary, but here I'll give Kinnaree a pass, because traditional street foods such as pad thai (and our char koay teow) rarely translate well in a restaurant setting. Unanimously crowned star of the meal was the homok talay, a generous assortment of seafood in a smooth, sweetish yellow curry sauce.<br /><br />Note the frequent appearance of the word 'sweet' and its variations in this review. Thai food is usually a roller coaster ride of punchy hot-sour tamed by salty-sweet, with a bit of fishy funkiness thrown. Yet like other dishes our nuer nam tok (grilled beef salad with mint) was two-dimensional, lacking any trace of sour or spicy to balance its sweetness (it was also missing from-the-grill char). To be fair the Malaysian palate does favour sweetness, and neither of my Malaysian dining companions missed the hot-sour element as I did. Service is excellent and the restaurant uses good, fresh ingredients (no wilted lettuce or brown mint leaves here). <br /><br />
If you like your Thai food on the mild and sweet side you'll love Kinnaree. But to my mind a Thai meal should leave the taste buds singing an aria; mine departed the restaurant with more of a minuet.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Kinnaree Thai Restaurant is a finalist in the Time Out KL Food Awards 2009 Best Thai/Indochinese Restaurant category. The Time Out KL's food awards are 100% voted for by the people of KL. This way, we guarantee that popularity and consistent performance is rewarded.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>The former Regent Hotel's architectural styles may have looked outdated, but the edifices themselves have not been rendered redundant. Instead, carefully renovated, refurbished and renamed recently as the five-star Grand Millennium Kuala Lumpur — Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotel's flagship property in Malaysia, and the first 'Grand Millennium' hotel in the world.<br />
Located in the heart of KL's Golden Triangle, guests won't have to look far to find shopping and partying at various entertainment outlets in the area.<br /><br />
Inside the Grand Millenium itself there is the recently opened high-end Pulse club. Guests can choose from enjoying the club's al fresco section's cool ambience, or unwind to dance beats at the bar, lounge area or dance floor, which can accommodate up to 200 people. Word is clearly spreading as even though it is a new venue, this capacity has certainly been appoached in recent weekends.<br /><br />
Guests enter Pulse via a see-through elevator surrounded by a seemingly endless line of wine racks, providing a spectacular if confusing backdrop.<br /><br />
At the bar and lounge area, the main stage is set against a backdrop of LED panels. Scans, moving heads, and special lighting effects are everywhere. A projection system also assaults your eyes, whether you are visiting or even down on Jalan Bukit Bintang. And if you haven't got a headache already, there are also glaring neon tables in the club.<br /><br />
There is, thankfully, an option for those not so keen on neon lights and glaring edifices. In the corner of the club is the Champagne Lounge — a more intimate venue for private dining. Younger guests will doubtless enjoy the loud, bright bar and lounge, but the Champagne Lounge is indisputably for a more mature audience. There is also a cigar lounge for connoisseurs to indulge their habit and sample the fine range of single malt beverages, the largest in Kuala Lumpur.<br /><br />
Top bands, celebrity DJs, and live comedy acts provide entertainment and there is also a handful of in-house DJs that spin during happy hours.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Anyone familiar with the tapas scene in KL would have heard of La Bodega, Malaysia's grand matriarch of Spanish cuisine, La Bodega has been responsible for introducing authentic tapas culture since 1999. <br /><br />
La Bodega Tapas Bar has now come to be known as the "place to hide". It's warm welcoming atmosphere has seduced a rather dedicated and discerning crowd of regulars, and is one of the most established gathering spots for meeting old friends and making new ones. The friendly staff will talk you through the tapas menu; start with the chorizo, tiger prawns or eggplant braised in olive oil, chilli and herbs. The paella valenciana mixta is very popular with its collection of fresh seafood able to put a smile on anyone's face. <br /><br />La Bodega Outlets in the Klang Valley:<br /><br />La Bodega (Bangsar)<br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>First on my list was <b>Ravissante </b>— <i>French for ravishingly beautiful</i> — which epitomises how owners Jane and Bee want their clients to feel. Opened in March 2008, Ravissante's spa treatments are a fusion of Eastern and Western techniques, with options to mix and match between the different treatments, which begin from RM98. Ravissante uses different ranges from Ella Bache, a French skincare brand, which is available for sale in the spa. <br /><br />
The Welcome to Bali package (RM148 for the first trial, RM306 normal price), began with a whitening lemon body scrub. Unlike most body scrubs, which tend to be too abrasive, this was gentle and soothing, yet effectively exfoliated at the same time. A jacuzzi milk bath followed and was such a relaxing experience that it had me nodding off (<i>it's no wonder Cleopatra was a big fan of milk baths</i>). <br /><br />
After my bath, Regine, my therapist began my 1 hour Swedish massage by rubbing me with faintly scented oil. Using her knees and elbows on various parts of my body, Regine managed to alleviate most of my muscle stiffness. Not only that, she also managed to crack my finger and toe joints (<i>something I never could do</i>), leaving my body completely relaxed. <br /><br />
Apart from spa treatments, Ravissante also offers slimming treatments, facials, manicures and pedicures. Members receive 20% off all ala carte services and 10% off all skin care products and in - house packages.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Kuala Lumpur's first Russian-themed bar, Red Square, originally hails from Jakarta where it's considered an institution. This 410 sq m bar offers a scene that's nothing new except the copus availability of vodka.</p>
<p>A vodka lover's dream come true, the outlet stocks everything from imported vodkas, flavoured vodkas, infused vodkas, vodka martinis to vodka stick 'Roska' cocktails. All of course naturally potent enough to quickly bring out the pink on your face like, erm, most Russians after having one too many.</p>
<p>Cocktails using vodka also attract the ladies who prefer something sweet or tangy. I recommend the outlet's specialities: flavoured vodka infusions. Not exactly for purists who prefer their vodka as it is, on the rocks or to go with the good ol' mixers such as soda or juices. <br /><br />
Red Square's interior in red, white and black with stainless highlights, comes equipped with colour changing kinetic technology. But who cares when there's a 10m long vodka 'show' bar with a stainless gutter and vodka infusion jars and branded bottles as decor on the back? You can even do some bar-top dancing if you fancy, and don't get in trouble for doing so. Unless your moves are just salah then you may be boo-ed off the 'stage'. On some nights, you regularly see patrons getting a move on the bar top. The turn of events can be amusing especially when those without any sense of rhythm persist. <br /><br />
If unashamed bad-dancing people gives you sore eyes, then just unwind with an order of drinks, ideally during happy hour (daily, 5pm to 9pm) when there is a buy one, free one promotion. Must-have cocktail: 'Hypnotonic' prepared with, what else, 'Hypnotic' brand of liqueur, tonic, lime and garnished with mint leaves, and 'Splash R&amp;B' cocktail made from Smirnoff raspberry vodka, lime, tonic, and crushed blueberries. <br /><br />
When getting high on drinks you mightn't bother with the music but it isn't bad, you know. Classic disco, new wave retro, Euro lounge, progressive pop, house and vocal-garage scales moodily pervade the space. However, regardless of the beats, the overall environment here is such that all you want to do is to say 'prost!'</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Madras Lane, the dark, dank walkway that cuts through the middle of Chinatown's wet market, boasts two stalls selling asam laksa. I eat there regularly but have yet to sample the version dished up by the middle stall. Why? Because I can never nudge myself past the divine hot, sour, and fishy fugue rising from a furiously boiling pot at the end stall. Not for me, grass-is-always-greener promiscuity. I've found a good salve for my asam laksa cravings and I'm sticking to it. <br /><br />
Now, I know just what you're wondering. No, this asam laksa isn't as good as what you'll find in Penang. But we're not in Penang, are we? Let's face it, every time we eat a KL version of a Penang hawker dish we know we're settling for second- (or third- or fourth-) best. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do just to get through.<br /><br />
Arrive at this when they open at 8:30am and your request for an order will be met with a sharp rebuke: 'Not ready!' The second generation running this forty-plus-year-old business takes his asam soup seriously. Better to wait till late morning anyway; by then the fire-red potage has had time to reduce and thicken, its heat and tartness mellowing and melding in the process. A serving includes the usual garnishes (fresh mint leaves, shredded cucumber and pineapple, sliced shallot) as well as two meaty canned sardine fillets, added right before broth is poured over. <br /><br />
Blasphemy! some may cry, but the oily, profoundly piscine sardine marries wonderfully with the soup's forceful spicy sourness. Adding sambal belacan and kalamansi (which, if you don't look Malaysian, you'll have to ask for) to this already heady brew may be gilding the lily, but I've never been one to run away from moreish more.<br /><br />
On Madras Lane seating is notoriously territorial, so don't sit down at one of this stall's tables unless at least one in your party orders from its menu. The stall also serves curry laksa and pork ball noodle soup. Both dishes look awfully tempting but, like I said, I just can't get past that asam laksa.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Space, the final frontier… okay, lame joke, but the 'Space' club really does have a sci-fi-looking interior. The latest addition to party-crazy Asian Heritage Row, the club will certainly appeal to many once they get over some of the kitschy tackiness.</p>
<p>When checking it out, the entrance looks tasteful enough but once inside, it's a whole other "world". Against industrial cement walls, ceiling and floor are velvet and leather sofas and tables — common enough, but strips of LED lightings in various neon colours accentuate and jazz-up many sections of the interior further brightened up overall by gauzy blue lighting. The lounge area nearest to the entrance even has iron grills where you can peep at people having a good time, or play a peek-a-boo game with your friends lounging on the sofas or bottoming-up with copious amounts of alcohol.<br /><br />
The waitresses dress in tight-fitting lycra jumpsuits in neon yellow that complement (if that's the right word) the overall lighting effects. So much so, I felt I was in 'Star Trek' during my recent visit. Only thing was that I was surrounded by real mortals, the beautiful crowd and sexy waitresses. No strange-looking people with big ears and extra-terrestrial powers.<br /><br />
A place more suited for drinking, you can also hit the dance floor when the mood and music take you. There are resident djs galore. Every Wednesday (Cover RM50 for men; ladies free entry), 'Marco' works up an appetite for soulful and classic house music if you're in the mood for retro anthems. On Thursdays, 'Bobby' combines groovy and tribal house music — hard sounds more suited for guys. Which explains why gents enter for free, and ladies pay RM40 cover charge. A welcome and rare change for the KL clubbing scene.<br /><br />
Continuing the 'boys on top' theme, Friday's headliners 'Gregoire' and 'Glynn Tandy' fill the space with minimal techno (and you thought the genre was dead) and progressive house. Both genres are also offered on Saturdays (Both nights RM50 men, RM35 ladies) from 'Tandy' alone on the consoles. Space for a small one?</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Before I get to the actual topic, I'd like to highlight the irony of 'Robinsons' department store's opening in Kuala Lumpur. Much fanfare was expected, but really unnecessary, as it is the return of a household name already familiar among Malaysians who know too well the department store's legacy of fine shopping in the halcyon days, before it closed down in the '60s. Then, late last year, when the Gardens mall opened, it paved the way for a new branch of Robinsons to open as anchor tenant. Although it's a novelty to some, the store offers a curious mix of shop-able goods and some dismaying products which look rather blah and similar to items found all over town.<br /><br />
Many worthy items however are at the home furnishings floor. Here, you can find international houseware brands like 'ASA', 'WMF', 'Henkels', 'Bodum'; beds from 'Simmons', 'Sealy', and 'Dorma'; and popular home furnishing names 'Margaret Muir', 'Dorma', and 'Hotel Collection Linens', among others. Not forgetting 'CK Calvin Klein' and UK-based designer 'Lulu Guinness.' Besides obsessing over their high-fashion, you can now do the same with their upscale home staples and accessories. Albeit for the well-heeled, of course.<br /><br />
'Guinness's range comprises an array of beddings with quirky, even playful prints, which are hard to find elsewhere in town. So there is little chance the insides of two homes in any particular neighbourhood will be alike. More so with the high price tags enough to make you gasp aloud. If you can afford any of the quilt cover sets of duvet and pillow cases and are prepared to pay anything between RM699 to RM959, good for you. In which case, I recommend the oh-so-delicate-looking set of duvet and pillow cases with small, feminine rose prints, ideal for both Victorian-styled and clean-looking modern homes. For something far less non-descript, 'Guinness' went for the literal 'Bed of Roses' selections of duvet and pillow cases with big, striking rose prints that scream 'sleep on me'.<br />
'Calvin Klein's home furnishings meanwhile are simple and fuss-free. <br /><br />
The subtle palettes, organic and high-tech fabrications, clean lines, and patterns that are proportional and balanced with little details. They are ideal for people who do not fancy clutter or imbalance in their life. If you do like what you see, selecting from the wide range is rather difficult. To start with the most basic of the basics, the 100 per cent combed cotton throws and decorative pillows in silk, nylon and cotton are all right by me. All made in Hong Kong and India but priced from RM1,009 to RM1,699, the tag will make even the most dedicated soft furnisher think twice.<br /><br />
To be honest, if you're okay with paying so much, why not go the whole hog? I recommend the made in Italy bed linens (RM2,599 to RM5,187). They're like scarves delicately draping over the bed, and designed to be sheer so the colour and print of the fabric beneath shows through. If not for the peaceful sleep, then at least buy it for a little self-gratification. After all, what is bedtime for...?<br /><br />
For more realistic retail therapy, the 'Bed &amp; Bath's tasteful accessories, plush pillows, cushions and throws, bear designs with a modern and utilitarian American sensibility are favourite among New Yorkers. Better still, they don't cost you an arm and a leg, and still make your home look cool and respectable.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>My initial thought that the restaurant was going to be one of those over the top places with posh décor only to be let down with rubbish food. But I was in for a pleasant surprise. By the corner of Jalan Dang Wangi, first timers may have a little difficulty finding the restaurant as it's somewhat hidden by the corner. Décor of the place is intriguing, with the vibrant match of white leather couch fitted with brown table tops fitted with a small bar and two huge mirrors along the right wall with written messages from patrons who have swung by. It reminded me of those 50s and 60s diners in films. <br /><br />
The Pink Sage specialty is they offer breakfast all day for food lovers during the weekend which is great for those who like to have breakfast at their own leisure. Breakfast menu is rather straightforward, buttermilk pancakes (RM12.50), mushroom omelet (RM8.50), and bagel breakfast roll (RM11.50). There are several other choices which makes variety a good thing but you'll be spoilt for choice (easy on the tummy, not so on the mind). For those big hitters there is the stacked breakfast (RM14.50) which includes two eggs (scrambled or sunny side up), a choice of beef/chicken sausage accompanied with mushrooms, potatoes, beans and beef bacon. I came in the morning feeling rather famished; I decided to have a go. It is presented well, with combination of perfect seasoning and cooked perfectly gave an all round satisfaction.<br /><br />
The lunch menu which is served until 7pm offers some variations of food that I may find in other restaurants and new delights that I find interesting to try out. For you burger junkies, there is the classic Cheeseburger (RM18), Veggie Burger (RM17) and other choices which are accompanied with chips and coleslaw. The other choices on the menu whether you like it grilled or have a craving sensation for some pasta. The choices given are tough to make with temptations such as Sausage Fettuccini Carbonara (RM18), and Grilled Ribeye with asparagus (RM32.50) to name a few. With such variety, I went old fashion and ordered myself a good old' cheeseburger. As it was time to dig in, presented with a burger half wrap (easy to munch without getting too dirty) with chips and coleslaw on the side. The burger was cooked brilliantly with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and cheese melts. The succulent juices from every bite just left a satisfying feeling to my palate.<br /><br />
With a pleasant setting and reasonable prices, I would recommend it whether you're working in the city and looking for a quick bite or you have a few hours to spare to laze around during the weekends.<br /><br /><b>Rating:</b> 4/6</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>It was supposed to be soothing but I was trying so hard not to laugh. 'Breathe. Close your eyes. Relax your mind,' my therapist whispered in my ear in a mock lullaby tone. It's no fault of hers actually. It's just that with her thick Thai accent, it came across as corny and funny. But I enjoyed that comic relief, along with my two-and-a-half-hour Body Bliss treatment (RM350), which started with a corn cob body scrub and followed by a 90-minute Thai Aromatic Massage.<br /><br />
Unlike most scrubs that leave your entire body exposed throughout the process, this one kept me fully covered under fluffy towels, save for the part of the body which the therapist was working on. She would replace the towel after applying the scrub so I wouldn't be left shivering in the cold.<br /><br />
The Thai Aromatic Massage was more therapeutic than relaxing, which was just what I needed. Prior to the treatment, I had requested extra attention on my shoulders and back. And that's exactly where she started. Using a camphor herbal balm to help alleviate muscle ache, she kneaded rather forcefully (I asked for that as well) on the knotted muscles. I had to admit it was painful at first, which was only natural, but the relief after that was worth it.<br /><br />
From time to time, I noticed that my therapist was lightly kneading the muscles to locate the exact tense spots before applying direct pressure. That gave me the impression that she was knowledgeable in human anatomy (a trait which is not as common as we think it should be in the spa industry), and because of this, I was assured that it was going to be a good massage.<br /><br />
The Thai Aromatic Massage is not the typical Thai massage that we know, which is a form of oil-free stretching. This, however, is actually a deep tissue oil massage using palm and thumb strokes to specifically target muscular pain. Thann Sanctuary uses its namesake products and the massage oil, with rice bran oil as the base, is high in vitamin E and antioxidants.<br /><br />
Thann Sanctuary's all black design-driven interior is stylish and very captivating. What I like about it is that instead of emulating a tropical spa like many others in KL, Thann Sanctuary has gone all urban chic and contemporary, and at the same time remained classy without being intimidating.<br /><br />
The treatment menu features nine different massages, mostly Asian in origin. While the menu may not be as inventive as its interior, this spa scores points for its attention to detail and that makes a lot of difference. Just before the treatment, I was asked to choose my favourite scent from a selection of essential oils and after I had made my choice, my treatment room was stocked with toiletries infused with that particular essential oil. The experience felt wholesome and complete. And of course, the chocolate chip cookie that comes with tea at the end of the treatment doesn't hurt either.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>The signature restaurant of the Equatorial Hotel chain appears in five destinations in Malaysia, three of which fall into the catchment zone for these awards (KL, Bangi-Putrajaya and Pavilion KL). While voters didn't make clear which they had voted for, the consistency of each outlet is such that it could have been any of them. Renowned as one of the very best Japanese outlets in the city, Kampachi flies in their sashimi from the famous Tsukiji market in Tokyo. Proof of the lengths they are willing to go to in the name of top class Japanese fare.<br /><br />
There really aren't that many great (although plenty of decent/good) Japanese restaurants in KL, however, in the semi-recently opened 'Kampachi' in Pavilion KL can honestly claim to rival the likes of 'Zipangu' and 'Iketeru.'<br /><br />
The restaurant shares a name, brand, menu and owners with the outlet in the Equatorial KL, however, to my taste buds, the one in Pavilion is superior. The staff are just as friendly but the food seems fresher — although I can't see how that could be. Possibly the newness of the outlet played tricks on my mind.<br /><br />
We began with California rolls, which - hand on heart — are the best in KL. The filling of soft crabstick, carrot, cucumber, and roe were immaculately presented and once soy sauce was drizzled over the roll it was as fresh and flavoursome as you could ask for.<br /><br />
Moving on, and the soba and udon noodles were the undoubted highlight of the main course. They hand make them in the window of the restaurant allowing diners nearby and passing shoppers to see in as the dough-artists create their noodly work in their little heated room.<br /><br />
Art is without question a fair analogy for their creations once you allow them to pass your lips. The noodles really are excellent. And the soup they come in is rich and tasty, although could have been hotter. The rest of the meal was good without being great, the salad fresh if plain, as was the fruit.<br />
Having tried some more traditional Japanese fare, I took a gamble with the curry cutlet meal. It was much better than it's equivalents elsewhere in the city, with breaded chicken (It always strikes as strange that this is on so many Japanese menus as it hardly seems authentic) that contained genuine fillet meat rather than skin and a pleasingly thick curry sauce that contained hefty chunks of vegetables.<br /><br />
We left dessert and even deliberately spared ourselves the sake we would usually finish a Japanese meal with. Not because we didn't have room. We just wanted an excuse to go back.<br /><br /><b>Rating:</b> 4/6</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>We happened to find Angus by chance, after grocery shopping and window shopping and shopping shopping. I usually think of Japanese restaurants as a 'Bento Box' like set-up, with small cubicles, loud, fast service and tempura, or sushi, well, seafood mostly. But they did invent wagyu, right?<br /><br />
The entrance is simple. There is a modest wine cooler display and a little reception desk from where you will be ushered you to your table. There is no smoking in the main dining area but you can sneak off to the bar and enjoy your cancer stick there. The dining area is open and spacious, with a functioning open concept grill. A few private enclaves for a private party or business lunch line the sides of the restaurant. We're given our menu and I choose my appetizer, 'fritto caramari' (A typo: I'm not being racist, honest. Although, they might have recently corrected it though). The Boss (the guy who pays the bill) chose baked oysters (1/2 dozen).<br /><br />
The appetizer menu has limited choice; you have an option of fried, baked or fresh oyster, a salmon carpaccio and of course the 'fritto caramari'. Traditionally calamari comes in golden brown rings, mine were stringy, but tasty and crunchy all the same. The baked oysters were all right, although we thought they needed more time to bake.<br /><br />
We then ordered our mains; choosing the set meals to make things easier, for us really, because we had our eight month old in a baby high chair, banging on the table. I had the rib eye set which comes with soup, salad, rice or bread, and dessert. Our soup of the day was 'potage crème de corn' and it was gorgeous. It was smooth and hot and creamy, and was so good-I-didn't-want-it-to-finish kind of good. Then came our meat, my ribeye (200g) was cooked perfectly. I like my meat medium-to-well, with just enough juice. Boss had tenderloin (also 200g), medium-rare, just as he requested too. So they weren't joking when they asked us, like most steak houses do.<br /><br />
The desserts were instantly forgettable but pleasant enough not to totally erode the succulent tastes of the meat. I also want to mention that the table service was very good and efficient. The floor manager was super nice and accommodating even when our little man was chucking bread across the room. Sorry Uncle Angus, probably not a good place to bring small children. I would recommend it though for a good quick lunch if you're working in the city. <br /><br /><b>Rating:</b> 3/6</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>'Prime Grill, Prime Wine, Prime Time' is how they sell it and it's true; this is one of the best steak restaurants in KL.</p>
<p>The first thing that grabs you about Prime is its elegant modern décor, oversized tables and its wide open kitchen with an uninterrupted view of chefs hard at work. Attention to detail is a key element at 'Prime' evident by the house made bread and butter selection served to you the moment you plonk yourself down. Beef is a serious subject matter here with a selection of steaks from Australia, Japan, Argentina and US and what impressed me the most was the fact that you can order your steak based on cut, weight and number of days it's been aged. For non-bovine eaters there's also an extensive selection of appetizers, soups and salads with poultry and seafood dishes.<br /><br />
Opting for a mix of traditional steak restaurant fare, my partner and I ordered the apple wood smoked Norwegian salmon (RM45) and the truffle ravioli, mushroom fricassee (RM50). Of the two, the salmon dish stood out with the freshly smoked slices infused just right. The ravioli was a decent enough with pasta parcels packed with truffles and served with a creamy sauce. And then came the steaks.<br /><br />
Feeling slightly stuffed it was a wise move to order the 8oz selection of ribeye (RM95) and centre cut filet mignon (RM165). Both steaks were 200-day grain fed Black Angus and came with caramelised balsamic-shallot jus and cracked peppercorn sauces. The ribeye, which under the strict advice of the maître d' was served medium rare was tender and grilled almost to perfection. The filet mignon was tender and full of flavour and juicy enough even though it was ordered medium well . Both steaks came with side orders of Truffle mashed potato, Wild green asparagus and Idaho steak fries (RM15 each) which complimented the meal quite well.<br /><br />
We left 'Prime' stuffed and satisfied and with total agreement that it was clearly head and shoulders above some of the other steak restaurants in the city. We do however have to stress that quality does come at a price and 'Prime' is clearly a place only fit for special occasions or if you have deep pockets. A full meal at 'Prime' for two can set you back up to RM400 which is high but certainly worth it, especially when it comes to quality steaks.<br /><br /><b>Rating:</b> 5/6<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Sarawak laksa is a bit of a mystery. Google 'laksa lemak,' 'Penang laksa,' even 'laksa utara,' and pages of links to recipes appear before your eyes. Yet few and far between are the web-published recipes for the dish most often associated with the coastal city of Kuching. Luckily a Sarawak-worthy version of the state dish can be found in a quiet corner of Bangsar.<br /><br />
The petite, sweet-faced vendor dishing up Sarawak laksa at Nam Chuan coffeeshop hails from Cat City and tells us that many of her ingredients do too. She declines to elaborate on exactly what goes into the fabulously spicy coconut milk-based soup she spoons over your choice of yellow mee or beehoon (pssst … go for the rice vermicelli; they're a better balance for the rich soup), but we're guessing ingredients include candlenuts, garlic, ginger, and dried spices including ground coriander seeds and one of Sarawak's biggest exports, black pepper (drain your bowl of soup and you'll leave a ground-spice ring).</p>
<p>If the ground dried chilies don't set your tongue a tingling add a dollop of roasted chili sambal, served alongside with a kalamansi half. Blanched bean sprouts add a bit of crunch and a flurry of chopped Chinese celery some colour, and halved prawns, shredded chicken, and sliced omelet round out the dish.<br /><br />
This vendor offers other notables as well: chopped pork-topped abacus seeds (chewy yam mini dumplings that vary in color from dull gray to shocking violet, depending on the type of yam that went into the dough that day) and, on weekends, spicy black pepper pig stomach soup and a comforting stew of herbal chicken. But her laksa is firmly, and deliciously, front and centre. In Kuching, Sarawak laksa is breakfast food, found at too many stalls and coffee shops to count from 6am on. We can't think of a better way to start the day. <br /><br /><b>Rating: </b>4/6<br /><br /><i>Images by David Hagerman</i></p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>They say Malaysia's best Malay food is found in private kitchens. Consider Fatimah Selera Kampung your entrée to 'mom-style' Malay cuisine. Every dish on offer comes out of a home kitchen; the very casual, open-air restaurant is, after all, built onto the side of a private Kampung Baru home. Pakcik Nordin, Fatimah's amiable proprietor, is happy to explain what's on offer, but a point-and-shoot approach at the buffet-like display works well too.<br /><br />
It's all good, but the fish dishes are Fatimah Selera's brightest stars. Ikan kembung, a smallish fish with oily flesh that takes wonderfully to the grill, might on one day be served plain and crispy-skinned, with a dipping sauce of kecap Nikkomanis and chopped chilies on the side, or stuffed with a fragrant combination of grated coconut, turmeric, chilies, and lemongrass the next. For assam fish meaty chunks of a firm, white-fleshed variety stew in a sweet-and-sour, not too spicy chili gravy. Ikan bilis show up in a wonderful house 'relish' that changes daily; on our last visit it consisted of a mixture of fresh mild chilies, caramelised onions, and chopped fresh and pickled mustard greens.<br /><br />
The restaurant's homey chicken curry sells out quickly for a reason, and the classic beef rendang is extravagantly spiced and wonderfully savoury, if a bit tough. Pecel jawa (blanched leafy greens, long beans, bean sprouts, cabbage, and nubs of deep-fried tofu topped with a peanut sauce made spicy or not, to order) makes for an excellent light lunch or a fine addition to a gluttonous repast, and mashed spuds fans won't want to miss out on the pergedel, fat potato cakes dipped in egg and deep-fried.<br /><br />
Sweets lovers will want to save room for Fatimah Selera's air jagung, a tower of shaved ice topped with corn and doused with condensed milk that forever changed my perception of that lowly vegetable as a never-for-dessert food.<br /><br /><b>Rating:</b> 3/6<br /><br /><i>Images by David Hagerman</i></p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Ministry of Sound in Malaysia. Wow, well, I mean, we're flattered guys. Our very own Euphoria nightclub. All you clubbers have probably been waiting for this for years, but it was worth it. A brilliant platform for more international DJs, the club is quite far away from the centre of town so if you can, get a big group of you together for an even better time. The more the merrier and all that.</p>]]></description>

<p>Water? I think they're avoiding the fact that this is a bar. They almost definitely meant alcohol. They have an impressive selection of shots, 4 studios for your lounging, dancing and drinking whims, one of which is pleasantly located outside, and one of which is private, so get hiring if you want to look super flashy.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>It is indeed a bar, and not a revolution, but perhaps a revolutionary bar for its down to earth, unpretentious ideals of supporting the local music scene and providing a relaxed environment where you can listen to aspiring artists. If music isn't all you're after, there's also a bar and the opportunity for bites to eat. Lovely. Also, their website is so cool it's almost better than the bar - check it out (on the left).</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p><b>Ambience </b>The setting looks quaint and spa-like. But, because of the pool layout, you can't avoid staring at the patron sitting opposite from you. You might feel a little uncomfortable if you are big on privacy.<br /><br /><b>Hygiene</b> The water is changed once every two days. Similarly, it is luke warm and continuously treated with UV rays.<br /><br /><b>Fish</b> Some of the fish are a little too big for comfort. At roughly 5cm long, you are afraid that they would bite off your toes instead of merely the dead skin.<br /><b><br />
Verdict</b> It is more of a fun than relaxing experience. And its convenient location might persuade you to drop by after a whole day of shopping.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>While most foot reflexology centres in Bukit Bintang are designed like a factory line serving up treatments that are more utilitarian than pampering, Asianel has upgraded this oriental experience into a spa-like session. The reflexology treatments here are target specific, for instance the 'Immunity Booster' package that concentrates on the lymphatic areas to strengthen your immunity system.<br /><br />
As you revel in a warm lavender foot soak, the therapist will help you relax with a head, shoulder and back massage. This is followed by a cooling yoghurt foot mask and a 15-minute session on the plush chiropractor-approved massage loungers. The foot reflexology comes last.<br /><br />
Because the reflexologist is experienced and the pressure applied is measured, it is a calming experience that won't leave you wincing in pain. What really sets Asianel apart, other than its thorough treatments, are the little unexpected personal touches — shorts to change into, limited customers (only six at any one time) and a delicious longan herbal drink at the end instead of some cheap Chinese tea.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>With a name originating from a place in south Bali and a Hindu temple by a cliff there, the Uluwatu stores in the island paradise are well-known among the locals and tourists. Malaysian travellers like me, in a past visit, are no exception. If you're in the game for hand-made Balinese lace, you may not be aware that we have our own local outlet that opened last April. It is well worth the visit, whether you want to make purchases or just to check out whether it carries a decent range of delicate designs sourced from the Bali stores. The answer to that is yes, although the range is not here in its entirety.<br /><br />
Using the krawang (cutwork) method, lace is stretched on bamboo hoops and sewn by hand on foot-powered machines identical to the old Singer machines, now seen only as antiques in the rest of the world. The thread is carefully built-up layer upon layer as the hoop moves back and forth. The empty areas of the lace are delicately cut away, while the loose edges are caught and bound up by the whirring needle. A single item may take five or more days to complete, depending on complexity of items at hand. Quite removed from the practices used in English and European lace.<br /><br />
Besides lace motifs, all apparels and accessories feature delicate eyelet motifs. Yes, you can see such styles in our local traditional baju kebaya, but it's pricey to have a complete outfit handmade locally nowadays. The stores Malaysian husband and wife owners, Ida and Izard, have decided to price all items at only slightly higher margins (approximately five percent), as the turnover is 'not as fast as established high-street brands'. However prices are still competitive to those in Bali. Four new designs are added in the store twice each month.<br /><br />
And you're guaranteed to find clothes, bed linens, decorative and practical umbrellas, accessories such as bags, belts, handkerchiefs, hair-bands, table-runners, silk sarongs and scarves featuring hand-printed motifs. Lace tissue paper-boxes used to be sold, but quaint though they were, they were not popular and so recently discontinued. You can probably imagine for yourself the weird and tacky combination of lace and tissue boxes. If you're unlucky, you may still find some stocks available.<br /><br />
Ida explains that tourists in Bali prefer items made from linen, while the Malaysian store's customers, mainly middle-class Chinese, prefer rayon and cotton.<br /><br />
My favourite pieces are the Indonesian short kebaya made from rayon or cotton (RM189.90 to RM349.90); sundresses with beach-like designs and spaghetti straps (RM169.90 to RM199.90); and tie-back tube tops (RM109.90). Cheaper treasures include rayon-and-lace hair-bands (RM14.90) with the most expensive being rayon kebaya tops (RM349.90). There are also plans to bring in rayon A-line skirts, peasant and empire-cut tops soon.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Branded adventure gear is nothing new among rugged thrill-seekers and while French label Lafuma's goods have few novel designs, they're nevertheless ideally made for sturdy and high endurance use in the outdoors. Lafuma began manufacturing backpacks in 1930, but eventually expanded to produce assorted goods, which have been selling in Malaysian department stores for more than a decade. Although such retail channel still remains, it recently opened its own first local flagship store in Bangsar.<br /><br />
Offering products for trail and hash running activities, hiking, trekking, mountaineering and various lifestyle categories, there are three different products for each of the aforementioned category: 'un-limit' designed for hardcore adventurers; 'silver' for special premium collection; and 'essential' for customers on a budget.<br /><br />
Lafuma has also been involved in sustainable development the last 15 years. This commitment to the environment has resulted in the special range, 'Pure Leaf Collection' comprising eco-friendly products made from 100 per cent organic cotton and hemp, or recycle materials like polartec and technowarm micro-fibre.<br /><br />
The brand has also recently launched two new collections in the Light Hiking category and Lafuma Design for Women collection. The store's co-owner, Ng Hock Soon believes active women will be smitten by the 1.6kg Lafuma Naia 35 backpack (RM489), made from Velocity 420D polymide and designed for female hikers and trekkers.<br /><br />
Although I'm not made to endure such 'strenuous' activities, I still think the technical features are important for people more inclined to the outdoors than I. A good example of this comes with the 35-litre capacity, 3D Mesh back carrying system for good ventilation that comes with gel strap and belt inserts. It boasts various compartments and double access to the main compartment with wide travel bag-type front opening and is fitted with leak-tight zip, built-in with removable storage pockets for first-aid kit and wash-bag, and hydration pocket with tube port and rain cover.<br /><br />
Lafuma also sells a limited variety of energy drinks in packs and bottles. If you prefer scenic sights without roughing it, the store will also (slightly incongruously) carry garden furniture this year-end.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Before the food arrived this was down as a '2 star' review. But that soon changed.<br /><br />
The décor is 'authentically Spanish'. As long as by 'authentically Spanish' you mean 'walls are painted orange and a handful of bull-fighting posters are dotted aimlessly around'. The furniture barely fits the theme, likewise the white tablecloths (asking for trouble in a tapas bar where food is meant to be shared and spilt). However, that soon slips from your mind when the dishes start turning up.<br /><br />
A word of caution: if you're not into garlic, choose carefully. Most dishes would make even a Frenchman reach for the breath fresheners. But, as long as you aren't dining with someone whose mouth you intend kissing then all should be fine. Fortunately, I was with my wife.<br /><br />
Sticking with the (not-very) 'authentic' Tapas feel, the food all arrives together, brought by a hugely friendly waitress and waiter, who continually outdid each other on the helpful and friendliness stakes. And what they brought was excellent. The bread rapidly mopped up with a divine crushed olive oil, then the mushrooms (a delicious mix of at least three varieties) gobbled, the shrimps sucked clean, the meatballs devoured and, most outstanding of all, the tiny pieces of lamb in mint sauce were polished off, too. We also shared some Sangria, which although was reasonable, it lacked a little of the head-smacking power of other Sangrias I've tasted.<br />
The only disappointing part of the meal was the 'tortilla'.<br /><br />
Perhaps, having travelled through Spain and virtually lived off this magnificent culinary invention for several weeks, I've been somewhat spoiled when it comes to mixing eggs and potatoes. The one at Sentidos was no more than a poor man's omelette. Still, to be fair, the plate it came on was still cleared.<br /><br />
Tapas doesn't have to be about a dark, busy bar, where you count up the number of toothpicks on your plate before passing grubby banknotes to an obese barman with a ropey moustache. I don't think, however, it works as a fine dining concept, which makes Sentidos's location in Starhill a little incongruous. However, it doesn't really matter where it is. What matters is the food. And on that score, Sentidos fully deserves its four stars.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Bijan used to be my favourite restaurant, so it was one of the first on my list to review for Time Out KL. However, it pains me to report that since their renovation late last year the quality of the food has really dropped. It is still unquestionably one of KL's top high-end Malay restaurants and some of the dishes are excellent. However, others have suddenly become either annoyingly inconsistent or just downright mediocre.</p>
<p>I went with visiting friends and it proved one of the most frustrating places to review, as some in the group were raving about their fantastic meals while others could hardly get more than a few mouthfuls in. On the plus side, the fish was all excellent. The best meal of the night, by some way, was the Ikan Siakap Masak Asam Pedas (sea bass simmered in a tangy chilli and tamarind gravy, served with okra and aubergines), although the chicken in spicy curry was also very good. Onto the negatives and the biggest let-down was the Daging Rendang.</p>
<p>A dish perfected long ago and served up in countless eateries in KL, but since last year, the beef rendang at Bijan has been over-cooked, dry and tough. This put two of our group off the whole evening so that no matter how enthusiastic our friends were about their chicken and fish, the night had to be considered a disappointment. And that was before the Durian Cheesecake. This dessert was even more divisive than the main course. Durian, the ultimate acquired taste, has been taken by the Bijanistas and put into this unique cake. Fluffy, light, with a beautiful biscuit base, these positive features fade into insignificance due to the overpowering stench and taste of the 'King of fruits'.</p>
<p>In my opinion this was just too much and ruined another delightful dessert. However, before I could even cover my mouth with a napkin to stop the odour burning a greater hole in my nostrils, no less than three of the party said 'Aren't you having yours?' and looked at the pudding with hopeful eyes. The menu at Bijan often changes, so I hope that before long, the restaurant gets rid of the poorer dishes and replaces them with food to match the best that they produce.</p>
<p>If they do that, they will reclaim the heights they managed when winning various tourism and culinary awards a few short years ago. And if they manage that, I'll even forgive them the Durian Cheesecake.</p>
<p><b>Rating:</b> 3/6<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Bijan was voted the Best Malay Restaurant in Time Out KL Food Awards 2009. The Time Out KL's food awards are 100% voted for by the people of KL. This way, we guarantee that popularity and consistent performance is rewarded.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>A Li Yaa's dining room, with its polished cement floor, bright white walls, minimal art, and two walls of French doors leading to outdoor seating exudes cool tropical modernism. This Sri Lankan restaurant's offerings are a fine introduction the country's easy-to-like cuisine.<br /><br />
But first you have to get beyond the confusingly laid out menu. Soups give way to 'tapas', a peculiar classification for deviled dishes and cutlets. 'Combos' are followed by 'family style' dishes (shared from one dish). Some foods in the 'combos' section also turn up under 'family style' but many do not, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Why not serve everything family style, since this is the way most Asian food, aside from snacks, is eaten anyway? I also wished for more explanation of dishes. Many diners will recognize rasam but how many know kool? Relishes called sambol are a key component of the Sri Lankan table, but plunked as it is at the end of the menu (sans elucidation), A Li Yaa's laudable selection of these brilliant bites is easily overlooked.<br /><br />
Happily perseverance is rewarded here. The Sri Lankan crab may be pricey (9.50 per 100 grams) but is easily the meatiest crustacean to have ever passed my palate. Skip the black pepper version (you're here for Sri Lankan food, remember?) and go with the curry (thin, brick-red, and incorporating perhaps every warm spice known to man), which somehow manages to complement rather than overwhelm the shellfish.<br /><br />
Odiyal kool, a wonderful tomato-based seafood soup exhibiting a rich brininess that suggests long, careful simmering, is like a Sri Lankan bouillabaisse. The recommended mutton paal porival brought small pieces of surprisingly tender dry-fried meat thickly crusted with a moist, fragrant mix of spices. For peratal, long beans (or, if you prefer, lady fingers or daal) are rendered silky soft in a caramelised onion-enriched mild yellow curry.<br /><br />
Now, about those sambol. They're only three ringgit a piece so order all four. Sambol pol is a vibrant pounded mix of onion, grated coconut, and saffron, while lively katta combines grated coconut with lime juice, onion, green chili, and loads of cilantro. Seeni is a cooked sambol of onions sweet from stewing and tart from tamarind, its flavour reminiscent of balsamic vinegar. Save room for vaddilappam, a firm flan-like egg and coconut milk custard imbued with the seductively smoky flavour of palm sugar.<br /><br />
The non-food experience could be improved. One shouldn't have to request extra plates for refuse, a crab cracker, and finger bowls after a messy dish like crab curry is placed on the table. We seemed the charge of no one particular member of the affable staff, so service was sometimes catch as catch can. But the kitchen is working it: A Li Yaa serves scrumptious, truly unique dishes. With some tweaking of the menu and a bit of direction in the lovely dining room it would really shine.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>The entire review of Kohinoor's could be summed up in a single word: good. Each dish is good, the service is good, the atmosphere also good. However, nothing seems to really exceed this level. Just as nothing is 'average' or 'below par', so nothing could be fairly called 'very good' and certainly not 'excellent'.<br /><br />
The décor and faded exterior are probably the ropiest part but then it is a North Indian restaurant, an institution hardly renowned for their decorating prowess. However, otherwise, everything is, well, good. And that's really nothing to be ashamed of. The majority of restaurants have at least one area that lets them down and Kohinoor's all-round reliability is to be commended.<br /><br />
We ate a variety of dishes and the quality was very consistent in each. The mutton biryani boasted light, fragrant rice and reasonable meat. The tikka masala was a rich red and coated the tender chicken well. Our side dishes of palak paneer and sag aloo were also very tasty and by the time we had eaten the fresh garlic naan and spicy poppadums, the meal had totally filled us up.<br /><br />
The meal was served by several members of their very smiley and helpful team. The location on sweaty, dusty Jalan Yap Kwan Seng is hardly the most atmospheric in the city, however, it, like everything was still perfectly acceptable for a good, honest, North Indian meal.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Clearly no one has told Tony Roma's that they aren't a high-end restaurant. But for your sake and mine, I hope no one ever does. Their self-delusion of grandeur results in a quite surprisingly good dining experience, especially if you are with your family. The calm, interested and knowledgeable service from the staff seems more fitting of a higher-class establishment rather than an outlet that could be considered a glorified burger bar. And the really remarkable thing is the attention given to your food.<br /><br />
The chef's diligence is apparent in the taste combinations on the simple menu and the concern shown by the member of the kitchen team who sent out our steaks and waited while we confirmed that they were indeed cooked as desired. All far above and beyond our expectations and needs from a simple family diner.<br /><br />
For starters, we chose the potato wedges and chicken wings, accompanied by no less than three types of barbecue sauce (I wasn't so keen on the honey, but the smoky one was terrific) - another example of Tony Roma's doing that little bit extra.<br /><br />
The quality of the meat also surprised us. The chicken in the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich was a decent fillet, while the rib-eye steak was deliciously tender and juicy. I've paid far more money for far worse pieces of beef than that. It is surely the highlight of the menu. The vegetable selection though was pretty uninspired. 'Fresh vegetables' suggests a variety, so to receive just a handful of broccoli florets was disappointing.<br /><br />
And, lest we run away with the idea that Tony Roma's is some kind of gastronomic haven of perfection, it still sits within the ranks of American Grill-cum-diners that you'll find at any mall or shopping centre. Hence, why it only merits a three out of six here.<br /><br />
However, the great thing about Tony Roma's, and the reason that they could be considered superior to the likes of 'Chilli's', is the fact that they are not prepared to accept this label, even if you or I try to attach it to them. They try not to just churn out burger after burger and steak after steak. They take care of you. And I think they succeed.<br /><br /><b>Rating:</b> 3/6<br /><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Jarrod &amp; Rawlins' glowing reputation precedes them. We went along to see how deserved their 'rep' is at their main outlet in Jalan Dungun (set the GPS, it is quite difficult to find), Damansara Heights.<br /><br />
We went along on a Saturday lunchtime, while they were also entertaining a children's birthday party downstairs. This meant we were sat upstairs on the balcony, which had the added bonus of being surrounded by trees and foliage, giving a very 'green' feel to the meal.<br /><br />
I went for the J&amp;R's Breakfast, which was the house special, containing as it did more in the way of meats, eggs, toasts and such forth than any of their other breakfasts. There was certainly plenty of food, and the quality was amazing. The pork sausage and bacon rashers were so rich and packed with flavour, while the mushrooms, egg and tomatoes were just right. The toast was homemade and with two slices of that on top of everything else, it was a struggle to finish. I'm very particular about my cooked breakfasts and this was the best I've had in Malaysia. Everything was near perfect. So far, so good.<br /><br />
My partner tried the beef burger and was also impressed, although the meat was pinker than requested and the side salad seemed a bit dry and unappetising. The meat was of very good calibre though. Which is probably why the deli downstairs, where you can purchase the sausages, bacon, kebabs, pies, and various other savoury delights, does such good trade in spite of its high prices.<br /><br />
Jarrod &amp; Rawlins is a name most local readers know. But if for any reason you haven't made it to one of their outlets (the latest has recently opened on Jalan Ampang) and you like Western food, you are missing out. Their service is friendly, and the outlet is relaxing and comfortable, whether you are in a couple, family or even a large group. And the food is outstanding. Certainly the best restaurant of its kind in KL and even in my home country of England a restaurant this good would stand out.<br /><br /><b> Rating:</b> 5/6<br /><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>My first encounter, two and a half years ago, with fish head beehoon, was dismal. The dish's insipid, milky broth floating a clump of tasteless rice noodles, the odd piece of tomato, and bony, all but flesh-free bits of fish head coated in rubbery batter struck me as culinary blasphemy in a place like Kuala Lumpur, where delicious food is so easily had. I was quite happy never to cross paths with this dish again.</p>
<p>But it will take more than one hand to count the number of times I've lunched on fish head beehoon in the last two weeks. The site of my conversion is Bihun Ikan SS20, a shop in PJ just up the street from Damansara Specialist Hospital. Head for the back, where tables enjoy a breeze and overlook a pleasant bit of greenery that obscures the expressway. While you're perusing the short menu you'll probably be greeted by owner Michael, a gregarious man who's likely to recommend the haruan slice fish, and for good reason.</p>
<p>Only a masochist would choose the bone-in head version of beehoon over this colossal bowl of robust fish-flavoured broth spiked with hwa teow chiu (Chinese sweet rice wine) and abundant ginger matchsticks and smoothed, but not blanded, with a bit of condensed. Slices of ripe tomato add a touch of tartness and complement the sweetness of plenty of large pieces of firm-fleshed haruan (aka sea bass), some cloaked in a not-too-thick batter that takes on an agreeable sponginess in the soup, others naked. Fish can be served on the side, if you like, or extra portions added to the bowl.</p>
<p>Don't overlook the fish paste with spinach, which often sells out early. Featuring lumps of housemade fish paste (rough-textured, barely bouncy, and truly tasting of fish) and plenty of spinach in a clear broth, it's a light alternative (or a healthy side order) to a bowl of beehoon. Also to be noted: one of Michael's Malay staff makes exceptional kueh. Look for the small daily selection displayed inconspicuously on a table near the juice counter-cum-cendol display case.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Our small group really enjoyed lunch at Rain Nudle House in Pavilion (there are some 13 other outlets around KL, including at Suria KLCC). The food was very good, the service excellent, décor stylish, modern and relaxing, but one thing let the whole experience down. Their use of MSG (Monosodium Glutomate).<br /><br />
Ever left a restaurant and found that for the rest of the day your throat was dry and you needed to drink gallon after gallon of water? Well, that's what happened to us after eating at Rain.<br /><br />
We phoned them to ask if they use MSG and they confirmed "just a little".<br /><br />
While not actually harmful, the salt is sprinkled into your food and, as with us, makes you very thirsty. Most modern restaurants have stopped using MSG but not Rain.<br /><br />
Which is a real shame as the food really was worth writing home about. We loved the green curry, which stood up against any in town. Even those at high-end Thai restaurants. We also shared a couple of noodle dishes which were packed with flavour and impeccably cooked.<br /><br />
Credit must also go to them, because my wife can't eat seafood and so not only did they remove any trace of seafood from the noodles she ordered but they even gave us a complimentary serving of chicken and vegetables to compensate for the lack of prawns in her noodles.<br /><br />
They've done very well with the décor and ambience, too. You can easily forget that you are sat right next to the bustling mania of the Pavilion food court, so while some of the piped music choices are a little strange (Spice Girls? In a Thai restaurant? Really?), it works.<br /><br />
The price is also exceptionally reasonable (4 main courses, drinks and side orders of fish cakes for less than RM65). I'd go so far as to say that Rain Nudle House is the best value Thai food in KL. So, lose the MSG, guys. You owe it to yourselves.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>The birth of multiplexes in Malaysia began with TGV 1 Utama. Built in 1995, it revolutionised the movie-going scene and experience by introducing the multiplex concept. The complexes have all the necessities for a good old film watching experience - double armrests, cup holders, stadium seating. What more do you need? They are, of course, pretty up to date with the latest films in all of their locations:<br /><br /><b>Suria KLCC</b><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>More of a classic movie-watching experience, this mutliplex has 10 halls but maintains that old film house charm - red chairs, little matching red curtains and all. If you missed a box office hit, it's probably worth checking MBO to see if they're still showing it, but in general the films are completely up to date and in every language that a multi-cultural Malaysian could ask for. Also, the ticket prices are slightly cheaper compared to other cinemas, rest assure the quality is nonetheless good.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>When you're paying for a standard cinema ticket there isn't anything to fault at Golden Screens, but don't let that stop you splashing out for the Gold Class. A lot like Business Class, or even First Class on a plane, Gold Class means you get really really big leather seats, little tables, footrests, rugs (always a bit chilly in the cinema no?), and a button on the wall to press if you feel a bit thirsty but don't want to miss a death in your thriller or a joke in your comedy.

        <description><![CDATA[<p>1936 marked the launch of Cathay's first cinema, The Pavilion, in Kuala Lumpur. Three years later, in 1939, Cathay Organisation Holdings opened with a big bang in Singapore, sweeping audiences off their feet with its revolutionary air-conditioned 1,300-seater Cathay Cinema at the Cathay Building with seats as comfy as armchairs. From the 1960s to the 1970s, Cathay blazed a brilliant trail with over 70 cinemas in Malaysia and Singapore. Today, Cathay continues to be one of the key players in entertainment, leisure and lifestyle.<br /><br />
Each cinema hall is unique with its own themed interior. Ergonomic and plush seats are supported with almost 1.1-meter back-to-back distance, giving more legroom and comfort. Their stadium-styled seating guarantees unobstructed viewing.<br /><br />
There are also spaces reserved for 2 wheelchairs, as well as double seats for loved up couples to get all cosy.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>The lack of empty tables at the Little Penang Kafe tells its own story. This is a popular eaterie. Although you wouldn't know that from the number of diners remarking that the food in Penang is so much better.<br /><br />
And you know what? The food in Penang is so much better. But we're not in Penang and it is fair to say that this is the next best thing. Little Penang Kafe's meals are good, served quickly, and reasonably priced at RM9.80 (set lunches are a little more). At those prices, it is hard to find fault with it.<br /><br />
My friend failed to finish his Hokkien Mee, although that was mainly to do with the huge portion size. My Penang-style beef curry set lunch was nice—very spicy and full of flavour. Although the accompanying lor bak (made with chicken—LPK is fully halal) was a little oily for my taste. The Char Kway Teow was particularly good. My eating companion remarked that it is the best she has had outside of Penang. Which is no light recommendation.<br /><br />
The atmosphere is light and the quick turnaround in service makes this a good spot for lunch, whether you're at The Curve, Mid Valley or KLCC. Nyonya food may be better in Penang, but that's a mighty long drive when you're out shopping in KL.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>When college student Goh Wee Peng first tasted Restoran K Intan's wonton mee it was love at first bite. After a few twists of fate and months of apprenticeship to the shop's elderly owner and noodle shifu (master), the young Muar native and his wife Tan Chu San are serving up the very same noodles that sustained them through their student days.<br /><br />
Wonton mee are a dime a dozen in the Klang Valley, so it's worth mentioning that Goh makes his noodles in-house and without preservatives, to the shifu's specifications. Lots of egg yolks and minimal bicarbonate of soda result in skinny noodles that attain the ever elusive 'Q', a term used by mee connoisseurs to describe a perfect balance of tenderness and elasticity. Freshness is assured; several times a day Goh disappears into a flour-dusted room off the humble shop's kitchen to whip up a new batch.<br /><br />
But wonton mee cannot be judged by noodles alone. Happily Goh's char siew (barbecued pork), tender and sporting a beautiful mahogany glaze, sweet-sticky bits of char, and just enough fat, is worthy of its place atop a bed of his mee. Crackly-skinned, five spice-scented siew yoke (roasted pork) is good enough to eat on its own, and the delicate wonton served in a light broth are bursting with porcine goodness.<br /><br />
Tan supplements the specialty of the house with recipes from her family's repertoire. Earthy soy-stewed black mushrooms and knobby chicken feet (the latter an acquired taste, for some) can be ordered on their own or to top noodles. Her fine siu gao (boiled dumplings), with their translucent but substantial wrappers stuffed to near bursting with minced pork and crunchy water chestnuts are especially delicious eaten with their chili-vinegar sauce accompaniment.<br /><br />
In the evenings Goh and Tan add bak kut teh to the menu. Given their respective skills in the kitchen, it's bound to be a stunner. But I, for one, can't imagine a visit to Restoran K Intan that doesn't revolve around a plate of those noodles.<br /><br />
(Note: Will soon be renamed Kiu Siang Noodle House, under same owners.)</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p> </p>
<p>Reputed to be one of the largest in the world, this free-flight walk-in aviary is home to over 3000 birds from more than 200 local and foreign species, flying freely and living together in harmony and balance, creating a unique ecosystem of its own in this semi-natural environment.</p>
<p>This sprawling 21 acres verdant valley park is a bird-watcher's heaven - it's like entering into an enormous bird cage. Visitors can witness these birds in their normal behavourial patterns at close proximity.</p>
<p>If the bird-watching leaves you feeling peckish (hahaha) there's even a restaurant (Hornbill Restaurant &amp; Cafe) and various refreshment kiosks to satiate your hunger. </p>
<p>Entrance fee:<br />
Adult Ticket (<i>Mykad holder</i>) : RM 20 nett per adult<br />
Child Ticket (<i>Mykad holder</i>) : RM 10 nett per child<br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Aikido strongly believes that the gentle can be more powerful than the strong through proper techniques. Hence, it is a practical self-defense skill to have that emphasises wrist, elbow and shoulder locks, all of which are powerful and painful. Therefore, it is not so much a brutal physical force but a skill that understands and coordinates with the opponent's movement to gain the upper hand.<br /><br />
The Aikido Yoshinkan Shudokan Martial Arts Centre was established in June 2000 and has now grown to include nine other dojos in the Klang Valley. There are Aikido courses for both adult and children. It also offers half- and full-day self defense courses for women as well as a restraint and removal course, which is particularly useful for those working in the security or crowd control business. The latter will teach you how to restrain trespassers or troublemakers and remove them from the premise without injury.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p><i>Update: KDT Academy will not be offering Brazilian Jiu-jitsu for 2011</i></p>
<p>Here is a fitness and martial arts centre that is both casual and fun. The programs offered are equally as interesting. FizFit workout, for instance, is a 45-minute intensive physical training using your own bodyweight as the primary weight resistance. With the help of calisthenics, exercise bands and suspended cables, it is useful in developing and strengthening muscles, joints and mental concentration.<br /><br />
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu would be a good program to pick up self-defense. This form of martial arts will teach you how to gain a dominant position through joint-locks and chokeholds to force an opponent to submit and give up, regardless if the assailant is bigger or stronger. For something a little more intensive, the Crazy Monkey Defense programme is a highly specialized work-out that is only available on a one-to-one personal training basis.<br /><br />
KDT also offers Kettlebells exercise, which is primarily practiced using a cast iron weight shaped like an old-fashioned kettle without spout. While this may look a little funny at first, this exercise method has resurfaced recently with USSR athletes using it to develop grip strength, endurance and stamina.<br /><br />
Unlike chain fitness centres, KDT's rates are based on classes (with special rates for 1-, 3-, 6- or 10-month commitment) and there are no membership fees, annual contracts or administration charges.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Batu Caves is a limestone  hill, which has a series of caves and cave temples, located in Gombak district, 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) north of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. <br /><br />
Made up of three main caves and several small ones, the "Temple Cave" or "Cathedral Cave" is the best known of the caves. <br /><br />
The cave is one of the most popular Hindu shrines outside India, dedicated to Lord Murugan. It is the focal point of Hindu festival of Thaipusam in Malaysia.<br /><br />
To reach to the temple cave, you must make your way up a tedious 272 rock stairs. Watch out for the monkeys!</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>We're pretty much obsessed with anything that's new, savvy, and futuristic (and we don't mean the Avatar). So, it's not surprising that H5, the sleek concept store that reminds you of a science laboratory, is opening a new outlet at Mid Valley Megamall after the ballyhoo over their fashion-forward cult watches. Inspired by its edgy black décor, this latest inception of H5 is named H5 Black Lab pop-up store.<br />
    <br />
The outlet carries various watch brands but Nooka, the super cool digital timepieces, emerged as the best-seller of all times - although it does take a while to learn how to read time off its unconventional watch face. The omnipresent street culture in Malaysia makes the arrival of H5 even timelier. For trendsetters who enjoy trendy and yet wearable timepieces, the cutting-edge design of the watches available at H5 will be a cool addition to your watch collection.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Although a fairly long taxi ride away from civilisation, this eatery is known for its cheap and delicious meals. If you're keen on getting home-cooked meals, you can get it here in Kim Kee. Dishes like steamed bean paste fish and fish belly steamed with garlic ginger paste are among the popular dishes here. Besides the seafood, check out the deer meet or pork with salted vegetables. Also, a must try vege dish is the tofu with angle gourd, simply delightful.</p>
<p>The food price is very reasonable and the environment is lively with people chatting away. You can even bring your own vegetable, fish or meat and tell them to cook it. Isn't that great?</p>

<p>Teatime arrivals can order reasonable (in both quality and price) snacks including fish balls, sotong kangkung or tauhu bakar. Tauhu bakar? Oh yes, its fried tauhu with very delicious 'rojak' sauce poured over it.</p>
<p>Menus include their famous meaty crab dish, salted egg crab and a few other non-crab dishes such as stir fried clams, stir-fried vegetable and fried squid. The price is fairly reasonable so its worth trying.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>A hidden gem amongst the trendy nightspots on the Asian Heritage Row, Kristao is a double storey restaurant and bar that specialises in Malaccan Portuguese cuisine. The dark ambience makes it a perfect place for an intimate chat over a drink or two and it also gives a homey feel.</p>
<p>The chef is a Malaccan-Portugese and his specialties are Malaccan-Portugese cuisines. Try the chicken debal curry or other spicy selections such as the chicken vindaloo, beef lambila and navarine of lamb. However, the menu changes from time to time so expect different variety of food each time you visit. There are desserts which are home-made. Prices are reasonable.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>With its name referring to the Portuguese people of Malacca, Cristang has cultural and traditional influences in abundance. Located just opposite the Hilton PJ, it is an unassuming eatery with simplicity at the core. Their current bestsellers are the pork burgers, which come in seven different varieties ranging from P1 to P7. There are pork patties, pork burgers, grilled pork with mushroom, bacon and omelette, carbonara with bacon and debal curry. What's best is that you get a 20 per cent off on all pork burgers on Wednesdays. </p>
<p>The downside of Cristang is the slow service though. Other than that, great pork burgers. Did we mention that there's petai in some of the burgers?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Ribs by Vintry is the latest addition to the Vintry group and it certainly has picked out the strengths of its predecessors and built on them. A stone's throw from the original, it certainly serves to satisfy any meat craving. The interior has a fine blend of contemporary and rustic accents with its exposed brick walls and comfortable settees. With its meat-falling-off-the-bones texture and smooth barbecue sauce, the Bavarian ribs are highly recommended. The food here comes in a big porportion which is always worth paying for. They also have a good wine list. All this with ample parking and friendly service to boot.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Japanese fast food chain with a speciality of the mighty pork burger, which contains no MSG or preservatives. Ranked along the best burgers in the city, you might like to try the other deep fried porky treats here but you'll always come back for the burgers.</p>
<p><br />
The more pork burgers you get, the cheaper it gets! Although the size of their burger is pretty small, its quite cheap so it enables you to get more than one burger, and also, more than one flavor. Currently, Ninja Joe's have six different flavors ; spicy, original, oriental, teriyaki, black pepper and sweet and sour. In addition to that, you must try their 'shuriken', its a mixture of pork nuggets and mashed potatoes. Yummy!</p>

They have a rather illustrated menu which will distract you and leaving you indecisive on which food to pick but their waiters and waitresses are friendly and is always ready to help you out. Menus include fried assam prawn, laksa assam lemak, fried tang hoon, brinjals with prawn and sweet ginger chicken. The food tastes good but it is rather pricey for casual Nyonya dining. Although the quality is fine but in terms of value you can do an awful lot better.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Moussandra deserves it plaudits for not falling into the commercial trap and continuing to serve authentic Greek, Spanish and Italian cuisine in a rustic and cosy setting. With a vintage telephone in the corner and candles in wine bottles, this is as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the tastebuds. The highlight would be the sauteed beef rib-eye in red wine sauce which is fantastic and also their boneless chicken leg.</p>
<p>For those with a sweet tooth, you're in luck because Moussandra serves delicious desserts. Try the affogato or their classic tiramisu to wash down that delicious meal you had previously.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Billed as the first Spanish Mediterranean restaurant in KL, Flamenco has established itself as one of the best spots in town for a wide selection of tapas and wines. Parking shouldn't be a worry. The service is friendly and attentive while the vibe is soft and blissful. The rack of lamb, meaty yet tender, comes with creamed spinach and the home-made pates are always unique. The black mussels are delicious and worth trying and also, the deep fried calamari makes a very tasty appetizer.</p>
<p>The price is reasonable and the place is definitely lively. Very suitable if you're planning a night out with your friends.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>In Pucuk Ubi restaurant you can taste authentic Sarawak cuisine and experience the mystical state through its native ingredients. Although the menu is in the native Sarawakian language, it comes with a brief explanation of what it is. Menus include Singket (sago grubs), fried tempoyak, umai udang (lime marinated prawn salad), pucuk ubi Bidayuh-style (stir fried pounded tapioca shoots and leaves) and there's also a variety of Sarawakian fried rice.</p>
<p>If you're expecting cheap food, you're wrong. It turns out that the price is quite expensive. Fret not! Sarawakian food is hard to find here in KL so you might want to give it a try as it tastes good.</p>

<p>That's how you'll feel when you step into this restaurant. The nostalgic sound of local oldies can be heard as you self-serve your plate of nasi lemak. Oh yes, you get to choose what goes in your nasi lemak, and how much you want it. With food placed on a table, you make your rounds choosing from a range of delicious, tasty dishes such as chicken rendang, beef rendang and anchovies as well as your favourite nasi lemak sambal. Although, nasi lemak is their signature dish here, other food choices are worth trying too; laksa johor, murtabak and fried meehoon. As for the price, it is very reasonable.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Every foodie worth their salt (or sugar) knows about Ipoh white coffee, a roast coffee prepared with a unique method of modern and traditional Malaysian brewing. To get Ipoh speciality coffee, you don't need to travel to the city up the North/South Highway. Just go to Ipoh Old Town in Bangsar.</p>
<p>With a range of food such as the delicious pork balls in soup, which by the way tastes rich and meaty, shredded chicken hor fun and their famous deep fried fish with lychee. The fish has a tinge of sweetness which leaves your taste buds wanting for more. Also, do order their coffee to accompany their delicious meal. Its hot and delicious!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>No, not a Japanese restaurant. But yes, the gyu name comes from Japanese language, meaning beef. As a noodle house, Gyuniku serves up various beef dishes and noodles like wantan mee and kuey teow. The local favourite dish is ngau lam (beef brisket) which has the right mixture of chewy and soft. The beef brisket is provided with a sufficient amount of black pepper sauce and is cooked perfectly well leaving you lusting over more.</p>
<p>However, if you're not sure if you'll enjoy the food in Gyuniku, make an effort to spend your afternoon here and celebrate your day with beef popiah and sip a cup of hot chrysanthemum tea.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>The up-market sibling of the popular Madam Kwan's, Grandmama's is an excellent restaurant proving very popular with the busy Bukit Bintang clientel. Great selections of all the Malaysian favourites in a swanky setting at the top of KL's most impressive mall.</p>
<p>The dishes are almost similar to the ones in Madam Kwan's but the taste is a bit different. Although the nasi bojari is almost similar to Madam Kwan's, it has a special taste that sets the two apart. Other foods that are worth trying include fish head noodle, laksa and their deliciously oily hakka fried rice. Oh don't mind the calories, the food tastes good!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Okay, bear with me on this: Segafredo is similar to Batman. Seriously. You see, in broad daylight, Bruce Wayne acts as a well-heeled industrialist but at night, this dark knight perches atop the Gotham skyscraper to kick some butts. Like Bruce Wayne and his alter ego, Segafredo during the day is a quiet café that serves freshly-brewed coffee to patrons who enjoy a relaxing casual breakfast. But when darkness creeps in, this 'spuntino' bar - an Italian term for casual gathering place that serves coffee and small bites - morphs into a snazzy cocktail lounge, teeming with various types of martinis and high-end offerings. (Ed: that's one too many a coffee for our writer.)<br />
           <br />
With 400 espresso bars in more than 50 countries, Segafredo is the only bar that controls the entire coffee production process, from cultivation to blending, roasting and serving them in the cup. So you can be sure of the consistency of quality in every cup of Segafredo coffee.<br /><br />
Upon entering the café, you will be buffeted by a familiar coffee aroma that fills your lung with a jolting caffeine kick. As you imbibe the first sip of Affogato (gelato floating in a pond of espresso) and nibble that carpet of coffee powder on Tiramisu, you will realise that Segafredo, does serve quality coffee.<br /><br /><i>Kong Wai Yeng</i></p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p><i>Crack open the bubbly</i></p>
<p><i>TOKL Rating: 3/5</i></p>
<p>Greedy people like me aren't terribly fussy when it comes to food. The essence of eating just doesn't permit it, not when you are the kind of person who, when you think no one is looking, will steal leftovers left behind on the plates of others beleaguered with average appetites. A regular buffet is an opportunity to gorge, to consume as much as possible without thinking about what I'm eating. The champagne brunch at Starhill Gallery allows you to do the same but demands that you take notice of what you're eating, such is the menu that's on offer.<br />
    <br />
The standard offerings are available: a carving station offering beef and lamb, an assortment of salads as well as Chinese, Japanese and Italian cuisine. What is worth coming here for is their main course selection which encompasses everything from mixed grill, wagyu beef, pasta and teppanyaki sets - all personally and lovingly cooked on the spot and delivered to your table. Go for the Lemon Butter Sauce Lobster Thermidor - the meat is soft and delicious and I find myself lapping up every square inch. If you prefer lobster 'as is', the Grilled Half Boston Lobster is equally tasty. Our only sore point is that you can only order one dish from the main course menu. Opt for the champagne option (why wouldn't you?), you'll receive unlimited amounts of Piper-Heidsieck Champagne. We'd also like to point you to their cocktail menu, specifically in the direction of the deceptively strong Coconut Margarita. <br />
    <br />
Nothing elevates the mood like brunch so the room buzzed with that happy noise of people for whom brunch has a way of putting life in its proper perspective. This is a city that, whatever else it doesn't do, does talk. We definitely feel that this brunch is worth talking about.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently opened in the new look Lot 10 complex, Bon Ton is stylish place with an authentic charm of its own. Excellent wine list compliments the reliably good Malaysian food. A la carte menu includes seafood tomyam, laksa nyonya, assam pedas fish, lemongrass chicken, barbeque lamb chop, sirloin steak and many more. Bon Ton recommends their rib eye steak, sesame crusted salmon fillet and their lamb rack in herb. They also serve a lunch set which consists of soup of the day or salad (starter), spicy nyonya fried rice, roasted chicken with buttered rice or pan fried fish (main course) and as for dessert, you'll get a home-made ice cream! Delicious!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Seemingly separate from the bustling Jalan Bukit Bintang, this quaint restaurant offers a hearty mix of Middle Eastern and Moroccan cuisine. Tajine's interior certainly leaves nothing to be desired. The finer touches such as the vibrant tiles, decorative plates on the wall and glass lantern certainly set the atmosphere for a great meal. The food here is quite basic, albeit done with quality in mind. Dishes include the lamb kofta tagine, a bubbling hotplate of lamb meatballs in a rich tomato sauce and the tabbouleh, chopped parsley with a dash of lemon and oil. They also serves a variety of healthy salads such as Morrocan salad, Fetuch (fresh lettuce, tomato, cucumber, white radish topped with crunchy toasted Lebanese bread), green salad, Arabic salad and yogurt salad. If you've never tried middle eastern desserts, you might want to give it a try. It has a distinct taste!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Meaning "Korean Village", Han Chon cooks the dishes like you would expect villagers 'back home' would; in the traditional way. If you are a fried chicken fan, then you'll enjoy their allegedly-near-fat-free premium Korean fried chicken with only wings and drumsticks. Don't forget to ask for yummy home-made sauce. There's actually two types of flavor, which is original and spicy. Han Chon's fried chicken is cooked and dipped in vegetable oil making it less oily. But it isn't dry, in fact its juicy and the lingering taste of the chicken is to die for!</p>
<p>Food price is very reasonable and takeaway delivery is free to Sri Hartamas, Mont Kiara, Bangsar, and Section 16, PJ.<br /><br /><i>Halal</i></p>]]></description>

With the spicy beef &amp; octopus casserole, you might be surprised to see a big octopus lying down in the hot soup in front of you. WIth a reasonable price tag, Dae Sa Kwan serves all kinds of appetizers, seafood korean pancake, pork slices which looks and smells delicious by the way, and hot stone mix vegetable rice. Lots of home-cooked starters to get you started and wash it all down with cold Korean beer as you go. Oh and there's a free flow too! Free flow of sky juice that is.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Korean restaurants are mushrooming around the town. If you are in Bangsar area, drop in on Bon Ga to get into the trend. Reflecting its name, this eatery specialises in mouth-watering barbecued food. They have few sets of food such as the pork and beef set. Besides that, they serve delicious appetizers, chab chae, chicken bool kokee, kimchi jeongol and Haemool Pae Jeon. Got your tongue twisted? Worry not, you can just point out which food you want instead of saying it out loud. The staffs would gladly explain what it is.</p>
<p>Regular patrons order samgyeopsal (pork belly) and always, always take dessert… because it is free of charge! Overall, the food price is quite reasonable.</p>

<p>With choices like saba shioyaki (grilled imported mackerel with salt), chicken teriyaki (pan fried chicken with teriyaki), nabeyaki udon (seafood, chicken and vegetable in claypot) and a number of other mouth watering meals, U Zen also offers a variety of drinks. Its a suitable place if you're planning a quick snack or to explore a particular sampling.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>The choice among hip youngsters, the outlets formerly known as Sushi Groove do little more than change the terminology on its menu - 'Groovy Sushi', 'Dr Octopus Roll', or 'Japaghetti', anyone? - and offer a more contemporary-Japanese pop culture experience, it does so convincingly. A reliable and entertaining meal; just the way Japanese eating should be.</p>
<p>Although they don't have a very extensive menu, they do serve delicious desserts. Desserts like their wasabi ice cream, green tea ice cream and sesame ice cream deserves a try. It comes with a cherry topping to satisfy the lust of you sweet lovers out there.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Out in the old Hartamas area, down from the Petronas, near the Bulldog and Caterpillar, Isaki is friendly, casual and authentic. Pretension is at a minimum and the sashimi and other sushi items are very good. Try the buta kakuni, a lovely dish of steamed pork belly.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Arguably the best sushi in the country, which explains why this is a new entry for this month's Food 40. Aoyama does all the standard Japanese fare very well from tasty, fresh fish to crispy tempura, plus the odd speciality featuring caviar and foie gras to show its higher end side. However, this is no exclusive outlet, there is genuinely something for everyone.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>RM188 per person for a five-course wine pairing dinner is a pretty decent deal. The wines served during this one-off event range from the traditional Tuscan DOCG's to the latest Tuscan Urlo. Grown and cultivated from the Ruffino vineyards of Tuscany, this Italian label has produced some fine wines for over 130 years. In fact, Chianti Ruffino is one of the very first Italian wines that make it into the world market. <br />
Victuals come in the form of pan-sealed US scallops, oven-roasted lamb loin with steamed asparagus and button mushrooms and squid linguine served with peanut sauce and black caviar.</p>
<p>As for dessert, opt for the Spicy Chocolate Parfait or the Moist Rosemary and Olive Oil cake, best served with the 2006 Serelle Vin Santo del Chianti.<br />
To round off your evening Alan Wong, advisor to wine producers in Tuscany and Rheingau Germany, will share his expertise on the various Ruffino wines.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Catering mostly to urbanites working in the area, Roma Pizza Club serves plank-shaped pizzas with healthy, wholesome ingredients thrown on a thin crust baked to a crunchy perfection. It's hardly a mystery why the place is always packed during the lunch rush-hour as the pizzas are made fresh to order and are hot, crisp and pack a punch when bitten into. Among the more popular pizzas are the Carmelo and the Basiculus. The no-nonsense futuristic design of the interior takes pity on the lonely lunch-ers, with LCDs screening movies to entertain you if you are alone.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Piza, the new Italian restaurant at Changkat probably has some of the better food we've tasted. Their signature tuna sashimi pizza, adorned with marinated tuna sashimi slices with arugula on tomato sauce and mozzarella, drizzled with 20 year-old balsamico (the stuff that costs hundreds of ringgit for a small bottle) and truffle oil is utterly, utterly amazing. Their pizzas are fantastic and their pastas and secondi courses (try the terrific la gamba di agnello di bambino con patate di rosmarino, roasted baby lamb leg with rosemary potatoes and cianti sauce) and desserts are solid (mango tiramisu anyone?).</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Cone Pizza is what it says it is - pizza in the shape of a cone, sort of like the Italian equivalent of a pai tee. The pizza dough is literally shaped into a cone and filled with pizza toppings. Most unusual but a trend that has taken other parts of the world by storm and is now here in KL.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p><i>Good for all the right reasons</i><br /><i>TOKL Rating: 3.5/5<br /></i><br />
In the ongoing battle for 'my restaurant is cooler than your restaurant' supremacy, it seems that many restaurateurs have forgotten the fundamental truth about running a successful eatery, and it's that the simplest things often work best. Forget the chrome, glass, slate and dancing unicorns; punters at the crux of it are basic creatures who are actually pretty easy to please. The irresistible aroma of freshly baked bread? Tick! Comfortable chairs and a cosy setting? Tick! Friendly staff and tasty, nourishing food in unstintingly generous portions? Tick! Tick! Tick!<br /><br />
If there was a cheat sheet for restaurateurs - call it Basic Restaurant Truths - then the team behind Favola must have gotten their hot little hands on it because all the right boxes were ticked when they opened this delightful Italian eatery. <br /><br />
It's unpretentious, it's inviting, but most of all, it serves food that evokes memories of the Italian childhood you never had, with flavours that assail your palate with tasty familiarity even as they beguile you. You get the distinct impression that Favola was designed for comfort, not speed. Oh, but the comfort! A complimentary bread platter is an auspicious sign of what's to come: foccacia studded with sun-dried tomato and other breads are paired with a variety of dips. An ephemeral but strangely full-bodied zuppa pavese - beef consommé - is served with wobbly egg, parmigiana and crunchy croutons, while the wagyu lasagne is like a well-loved couch freshly reupholstered in kid leather: it's familiarly comfortable but infinitely plush.<br /><br />
And although I'm generally a sprinter rather than a long distance runner, I reserved some culinary stamina for dessert, because the Illy coffee tiramisu replete with fizzy chocolate bits is as close to being a child as I'm ever going to get again.<br />
  <br />
Favola may have passed the food and ambience test with flying colours but it's a fact that the only thing KL-ites love more than good food in a comfortable setting is a great price list. Guess what? They ticked that box too! Hurrah, it's a jackpot! <br /><i><br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>With its original concept from Singapore, Vansh has certainly crossed the borders without missing a step. This plush establishment aims to create a "Surprisingly Indian" experience for the diner through its apparently unique concept of regional Indian cuisine with an insight into new-age India. The interior is relaxing with Sanskrit embedded around the restaurant. The chicken vindaloo retains its flavorful taste while being not too spicy. Be warned, over here, quality comes with a fitting price tag.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>A few doors down from McDonald's at e@Curve, Funky Villa is your typical restaurant cum bar and lounge. If all you need is a drink, something to eat and then go, Funky Villa's convenient location and good drink deals make it a viable place for a pre or post movie hangout. We were rather intrigued by the colour changing walls on our initial visits. The colours fade from green to blue, illuminating the interior with an interesting fluid-like lighting effect.<br /><br />
The bar indoor is shaped like a crescent moon and across from it is an elevated lounge area, cordoned off with a curtain of translucent beads. All decked out in comfy sofas, this is a good spot for larger groups. There are more seats outside at the terrace, which sports an upper deck as well. Music wise, you can expect the usual 80s hits, Top 40 and electro house.<br /><br />
There's a respectable selection of wines and liquors. Beer wise, Hoegaarden, Stella and O'Connors are all available on tap. Weeklong drink promotions are quite worthwhile: beer tower comes at only RM99 nett on Mondays, whereas on Wednesdays you get one free cocktail for every two ordered. We recommend you try the ice cream cocktail if you are a fan of desserts. If you are really keen on eating here, the Thai menu has some worthy dishes as well, particularly the soft shell crab curry and barbequed skewers.<br />

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Offering all day breakfasts to patrons, Café Libre also throws out your standard local and western cuisine with level-headed prices. Some interesting dishes with a diverse menu. Don't forget to take advantage of the daily set lunch offers for a neat price of RM14.90 for any pasta or rice dish, a choice of Tea or Americano coffee, and Ice cream for dessert. Highly recommended is the  Spicy Seafood Spaghetti House Specialty or the Home Cooked Nasi Minyak with OZ Shoulder-cut Lamb. <br /><br />
Park in the multi-storey carpack at the back and the restaurant will reimburse you with any bill over RM50.</p>]]></description>

As if the perfectly executed Thai fare weren't already ample reason to visit, giant birdcage lamps and wing-backed sofas crowded with pillows in Khun Jim's fabled silks only add to the experience. The mussaman curry and tab tim grob, in particular, come highly recommended.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Here, an interior of dark brown wood, jazz soundtrack, compact menu and a brisk kitchen make mealtimes a soothing exercise in Japanese efficiency. There are interesting sides like unagi chawanmushi and fried oysters, but the starring roles are dominated by ramen that's cooked Tokyo-, Sapporo-, Kyushi-, and Kyushu Tonkatsu style. This translates into stock that's miso-based, pork-flavoured, or steeped in chicken for 11 hours; meanwhile springy noodles are paired with a variety of toppings ranging from tonkatsu pork and hard-boiled eggs to charred and crushed garlic. Tip: order the mini versions so you can try more dishes.</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>The curiously named Whipped Into Place exudes Bangsar coolness. A haven for lovers of good food and drinks, this hideaway welcomes all with its stylishly laid-back coastal resort ambience. Inspired by the relaxed elegance of Nice, France and Santorini, Greece, this eatery brings you a slice of the Northern Mediterranean  lifestyle.<br /><br />
Diners are provided with  a delicious mix of local, Western, Northern Indian cuisine and some pretty mean cocktails. With that many versions of a mojito on the menu, there is a danger of you not making it as far as the food menu (which is not crazily expensive). That would be a mistake. The fish and chips come highly recommended.<br /><br /><i>Pork Free</i></p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>A hidden gem among Kl's hipsterati set, Sticky Fingers is a cosy, casual eatery  for meat lover's galore. Get well and truly stuck into hearty Pork Ribs and barbecue sauce or even a 'half slab' of lamb.  Order the 'Baby Back Rack' famous ribs, full slab at RM28 and half slab for RM21, with their original STICK BBQ sauce. This is hands on (no wonder the sticky fingers), elbow deep, eating of the meaty variety.  But, prepare your gnashers as some have reported that the meat isn't as tender as it should be. Dessert specials are usually on the chalkboard menu, you'll be stuck for choice with chocolate fondant, blueberry apple crumble and more.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>
Tucked quietly away in a little nook near the pool, this is a great restaurant if you're in need of a little extra privacy (no one will find you here…). A tempting place to bring a special friend, relax over a glass of wine (selection from famous vineyards), and savour the gastronomical delights. The resident pianist is also often tinkling on the keys to add some extra romance. A must try is among their speciality flambé recipes. Besides this, Spices offers good Western cuisine, fusion-infused dishes and canapés. Though slightly expensive, it's well worth the extra ringgit as you can enjoy the comfort of the four-star Concorde Hotel.

        <description><![CDATA[<p>
Boggled by choice in KLCC? Pick San Fransisco Steakhouse if you feel like some proper San Fransisco food - steaks and seafood or surf and turf with the two on the same plate.  The food is delicious but it comes with a fairly hefty price tag too. Serving large portions American-style, the Steakhouse is ideal for big eaters and carnivores. Side dishes include fine-tasting salads, shark's fin soup, desserts and more. For a bit of everything, order a Set Meal available everyday at only RM16.90 with the chef's selection of pasta of the day, lamb shoulder, barbeque steak, and more.

Tripling as a restaurant, wine and cigar bar, QBA serves predominantly Latin American food with delicious Latino grills and salsas. And, to top it off, you can embrace the Havana experience by salsa-ing the night away  to hot beats and rhythms downstairs. Granted it's on the expensive side, but the service is excellent, staff are accommodating, and not to mention QBA is located in one of the most prestigious five-star hotels in the heart of K.L.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>
The third largest pizza company in the world, Papa John's is a well-known franchise from the USA. Papa John's boast is that their pizza dough and ingredients are always fresh, never frozen.  This results in a chewier pizza crust and more interesting toppings - they're definitely fond of the Jalapenos here. Papa John's promise is in delivering consistent superior-quality pizza. No authentic wood-fired ovens, but it's definitely one of the better fast food chains.

        <description><![CDATA[<p>This two floor restaurant with beautiful art deco that represents the New York grill is indeed a place where people dine and indulge themselves with superb food, lively conversations, and its vibrant atmosphere adds a zesty feel to it.With vintage Yankee posters and lots of red, this place is booming with energy.</p>
<p>The food is top notch and the menu very creative; welsh rarebit fois gras, salmon gravlax or parcels of seafood melange are all there for sampling. With a delicious mouth-watering menu for both lunch and dinner, one can not miss the dessert menu. Amongst the many delicious desserts are the banana toffee pie and the chocolate truffle. It's popular and rightly so.</p>

<p>Inspired by the love of meat and good food, hails MeatWorks.</p>
<p>They call it Beeftopia.  Rib-eye, sirloin, fillet, rump, T-bone, ribs… you get the picture? From salad to soup, and from burgers to steaks, MeatWorks serves just about everything that your 'meaty' heart desires. And with a huge choice of tantalising sauces; black pepper and Hickory  barbecue sauce to name just two. Not forgetting, for you parents out there, if you're planning to dine with your kids, look out for the fun little treat they have in store for kids.</p>
<p>For the brave (and seriously hungry) there is the Brontosaurus Steak.  Fear not, non-beef eaters there are plenty of chicken and lamb options too.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>'Marche' is French for Market and that is exactly what is on offer here.  Styled on a market place you can pick and choose your (super fresh) ingredients and have them cooked infront of you. </p>
<p>Furthermore, with a number food stations within the restaurant itself, be sure to stop on each and every station ; pizza, salad, pasta, bar, grill, dessert, juice, vegetable etc. There is also a children's corner if parents need some privacy. A variety of good food, and a good distraction for both children and parents. What more can we say?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Its tagline reads 'A heady dining experience fit for royalty' - surely an exaggeration but Soi 23 certainly has much to offer. The ambience is classy without being pretentious and mostly modern, with a few traditional Thai touches. Patrons can overlook the KL skyline while feasting on the outstanding soft shell crabs which are wonderfully crispy and light.</p>
<p>For you early birds or insomniacs, Soi 23 opens from 6.30am for their breakfast buffet and closest at 11pm. Expect delicious, out-of-this-world Thai-Asian cuisine and be sure to try their desserts.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Coca single-handedly made steamboat hip again, with their cleverly positioned shopping mall outlets wafting fragrant steam to tired shoppers. What's special about Coca is the fact that they have their very own fishball which has its own rich taste that would satisfy your taste bud. Apart from that, their steamboat is cooked on an electrical cooking utensil which saves you from all the uncomfortable sweaty situation.</p>
<p>Although the chain has downsized a little over the years, their steamboat has retained its goodness, with a mild, flavourful soup and ample choice of ingredients. Their calamari is also excellent. And most of all, they serve fresh ingredients instead of days old ingredients.</p>

        <short-description><![CDATA[Billed as a Casual Thai Dining outlet, BAHT is slightly hidden away from the myriad of fine dining outlets in its vicinity...]]></short-description>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Thairiffic <br /><br /><b>TOKL Rating</b>: 2.5/5<br /><br />
    Thai food in Kuala Lumpur seems to veer between extremes: it's either served by really grubby street vendors with questionable hygiene standards or in sanitised eateries in shopping malls, with rare standalone exceptions scattered few and far between. Enter BAHT, which falls into none of the aforementioned categories and for (more than) that reason alone, is worth visiting. Tucked away in the sleepy enclave of Lorong Kurau where time, apparently, has stood still, BAHT's decor is imbued with a quaintly charming DIY feel, but it's the vivacious staff, tasty food and cheap prices that grab your attention.<br />
   From the bog standard green curry chicken and four-angle bean salad to kale with garlic and tom yam soup, the menu makes up in taste what it lacks in creativity. The characteristic OTT fiery, savoury notes of Thai cuisine are present here in spades, but it's the fried marinated beef studded with cracked pepper that deserves star billing. Neither overly tenderised nor excessively chewy, the texture of the meat is spot on and made all the more irresistible by a peppery marinade. The main complaint? One (serving) just isn't quite enough. For the tight-of-fist, there are great value set lunches at just RM11 - the crispy chilli fish rice with soup, fruit and lemongrass drink is a good example. <br />
   Apart from a rather garrulous - albeit friendly - lady owner who will attempt invariably to foist sandwiches onto you (a residual habit no doubt from her days as the concession holder of Oliver's Super Sandwiches), BAHT is wonderfully peaceful and a superb venue in which to dine if you're feeling hermitish and/or leery of the air kisses of the Bangsar set, but don't want to venture too far away from the mothership. Fay Khoo  <br /><br /><i>15A Lorong Kurau, Bangsar (03 2282 0991). Lunch and dinner daily (call if you're a bit late for dinner as they sometimes close early), closed Sun.</i></p>]]></description>

With fully composed interior to soothe your mind, this place offers dishes like prawn with mayonnaise salad, braised pork rice, deep fried pork rolls and oh, the list goes on.

<p>The food price is quite reasonable if you're willing to invest your money in food that comes in small portions. This is also a good place to dine with your family or for business purposes due to its serene atmosphere.</p>]]></description>

<p>What else is on the menu you ask? Hot swiss cheese and no, its unlike any other swiss cheese. La Suisse serves deliciously melted cheese with boiled potato, pickled onions and cornichons. Another must-mention meal is definitely their Black Angus beef which would leave you begging for more. What's special about La Suisse is their sauce, the taste is just superb!</p>]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>The butter cheese crab in clay pot is a must try because diners come to Wong Poh specifically for it. Crack the crab and purr as the delicious melting cheese runs down over your hand. But if crabs aren't your thing, then try their marmite pork ribs or for an exotic experience (to some people, that is), try their pig intestine stir fried with 'chilli padi'. Another dish you should try, besides the deliciously irresistable butter crab is their 'teow chew' style steamed fish.</p>
<p>Now that we've covered the main courses, order wantau and eat together with your meal for an additional tasty bonus. However, you might want to order Chinese tea for you're in for a super treat here.</p>]]></description>
