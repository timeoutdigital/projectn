      <review><![CDATA[<p><i>By Sharmini Krishna Radha</i></p>
<p>If you've been following Dan Brown's writings, then you must know his famous book, Angels and Demons. Adapted from the book, the film  tells how symbologist, Robert Langdon (played by Tom Hanks) with the help of Dr. Vittoria Vetra, a member of the  European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) discovers the reappearance of an ancient secret brotherhood, the Illuminati. Together, they follow the 400-year-old trail of ancient symbols to uncover the truth.<br /><br />
Deep understanding and a vast knowledge of the Vatican as well as Large Hadron Collider and antimatter (from what we can summarize, it's something deadly) is needed in order to understand this complicated film. It does help to read the book before hand so you wouldn't bug anyone else by relentlessly asking questions during the movie. <br /><br />
Although the film and the book has several differences, director Ron Howard managed to deliver its key message to the audience. The long and almost 'draggy' duration of this film might turn you off though, but it is worth the wait to watch the ending.<br />

      <review><![CDATA[<p>This month's Anything Goes, Anything Shows! screening at Palate Palette is Favela Rising, by director Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary (2005).<br /><br />This award-winning documentary focuses on the good works of Anderson Sá - a social revolutionary in the slums of Rio. With the use of hip-hop music and Brazilian dance, he unites the community against violent oppression enforced by the drug armies and corrupt police. However, a tragic accident threatens to silence his ever-growing movement. Free admission. Also, free popcorn!<br /><i><br />
"Favela Rising celebrates the strength of the human spirit to assert itself in the face of human rights violations, social injustice, and unexpected adversity. Chronicling the rise to greatness of the AfroReggae movement, the film shows how the music and culture of Brazil's underclass transform into a catalyst for grassroots social-change. But most of all, Favela Rising is the story of a community that works. The success of the film should be judged on how well it serves to activate its viewers; how well it inspires action."</i><br /><i>- Jeff Zimbalist, Co-Director</i></p>
<p>Total running time: 80 min. (2005/ Brazil &amp; USA). Language: Portuguese (with English subtitles)</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Dir: Inoue Umetsugu (1957, 100min, Colour). Cast: Ishihara Yujiro, Aoyama Kyoji, Sayo Fukuko, Katahara Mie. <br /><br />
Set in the Ginza area of Tokyo in the 50s, Miyako - an owner of a jazz club - is persuaded to hire Shoichi as a musician. Although reluctant to do so as he is recently out of jail, circumstances force her to. Under Miyako's training, Shoichi begins to blossom and the two of them begin having feelings for each other. <br /><br />
Director Umetsugu paints a swinging 50's Tokyo in this film, full of vibrant music, combining serious drama with casual teen flick that shows the contrasting culture of traditional Japan and the influence of modern American way of life and its effect. <br /><br />
Free admission.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Avatar is set to make a return to the big screen.</p>
 
If you didn't get enough of 'Avatar' the first time around or thought it was somewhat lacking in total running time, never fear. From Aug 26, an extended version will be shown in local cinemas with eight minutes of never before-seen footage, exclusively in 3D.
 
If you've been stuck in a deep sleep in a far flung stasis chamber somewhere in a galaxy far far away, and don't know what Avatar is, well, here's the gist of it:
 
Avatar is, to date, the highest grossing film of all time. Director James Cameron takes audiences to a spectacular world beyond imagination, where a reluctant hero embarks on a journey of redemption and discovery as he leads a heroic battle to save a civilization.  Avatar delivers a fully immersive cinematic experience of a new kind, where the revolutionary technology invented to make the film disappears into the emotion of the characters and the epic nature of the story.

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Palate Palette monthly film screening night, Anything Goes, Anything Shows!, returns with Sita Sings the Blues, directed by Nina Paley (2008).<br /><br />This animated film is an interpretation of the Indian epic, Ramayana. The film follows Sita, a faithful Hindu goddess who follows her husband, Rama when he is exiled to a forest for 14 years. This quirky film has a cast of hundreds, populated by fling monkeys, evil monsters, gods, goddesses, warriors, sages and winged eyeballs. All its musical numbers are choreographed to the 1920's jazz vocals of Annette Hanshaw. Also, the animation is totally adorable.<br /><br />
A  tale of truth, justice and a woman's cry for equal treatment, Sita Sings the Blues earns its tagline as "The Greatest Break-Up Story Ever Told." <br /><br /><i>Total running time: 82 mins. 2008 / USA / Animation / English</i></p>]]></review>
