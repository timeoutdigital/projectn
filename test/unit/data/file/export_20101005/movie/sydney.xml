      <review><![CDATA[Pop quiz: in the 81 years of the Academy Awards, how many women have been nominated for the best director Oscar? Answer: three; namely Lena Wertmüller (Seven Beauties, 1975), Jane Campion (The Piano, 1993) and Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation, 2003). On 3 February Kathryn Bigelow will certainly make that four, and she's the odds-on favourite to actually take home a golden phallic symbol come March. And deservedly so: The Hurt Locker, which has swept critics awards across the US, articulates the Iraq War in a way that's never
been this thrilling.
"It's extraordinary to look at a day in the
life of a Baghdad bomb tech," says Bigelow, 57,
chipper on the phone from LA. "There's no margin for error: no ‘I almost cut the right wire,'" she continues. "These individuals arguably have
the most dangerous job in the world, and they volunteered for it."Bigelow's incendiary yet contemplative action drama is her first feature since 2002's Harrison Ford nuke-sub thriller, K-19: The Widowmaker.
Prior to that, she made a string of odd genre movies: an
unusually affecting vampire film, Near Dark (1987); the surfer-narc mano a mano, Point Break (1991); the Ralph Fiennes millennial thriller, Strange Days (1995). Her work over the past six years has been less visible, mostly television and shorts."That's
the cost of wanting to make something with total creative control,"
Bigelow says, with time-tested serenity. "Filmmaking is not for the
faint of heart." The Hurt Locker, produced via indie fund-raiser Nicolas Chartier (Crash),
afforded Bigelow final cut and the ability to cast two excellent
non-A-listers, Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie, in key roles as a
daredevil defuser and a by-the-book sergeant. "For me, it
always starts with the character," Bigelow offers, uneasy with being
pegged as a genre specialist. "I need to work from the inside out.
Seriously, what would incite you or I to wake up one day and think,
Hmm, bomb defusing is a vocation I'd like to pursue? And what's the
price of that heroism? They call it the lonely walk – the walk in the
heavy suit toward the suspicious object. You're by yourself. The war
has stopped for you. It's probably a very existential moment."Bigelow
met with soldiers in Kuwait and elsewhere to understand that moment,
also leaning heavily on journalist Mark Boal's screenplay, the product
of a 2004 embedding with an army bomb squad. Rooted in its characters'
stoic sense of professionalism and shot in and around Amman, Jordan, The Hurt Locker is refreshingly free of politics – indeed, the filmmaker considers it the
first Iraq War movie that's actually about the ground situation itself.
"I do consider myself a political person," she says, "but we've lost
sight of the troops that are fighting over there. There's now a
perception among them that this is a job – a good one, even – and not the Vietnam-era draft mentality of old."She has a sensibility that recalls Howard Hawks films
like Only Angels Have Wings and Rio Bravo, which
focus on characters quietly working through jeopardy with a minimum of
fuss. "Courage is not the absence of fear," Bigelow continues, "but
maintaining a sense of humour in the face of fear." That's as far as she
wants to explain it; we move on to the logistics of a summer shoot in
the Middle East and the immersion of her actors in four-camera
disarmament sequences, take after take. (Bigelow, once married to James
Cameron, can talk shop with the best of them.)
Inevitably, the
question does arise; the one that's tailed Bigelow throughout her
career making pictures associated with men's tastes. Actor Renner, by
phone, is direct in his defence: "I always get a little tense when
people bring it up. Just because she has long, shaved legs means she
can't direct a great movie?""I've been fortunate and tenacious," Bigelow admits on
the gender issue, but can't claim to have encountered any significant
resistance. "It would be impossible for me to not be who I am, and do
what I do." She laughs, well practiced at this pause. "I simply don't
bifurcate the job description." Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[The Red Shoes]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[A romantic fantasy about a doomed ballerina, the 1948 film The Red Shoes, directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, has been restored with the help of Martin Scorsese, whose own Shutter Island is currently in cinemas. The Red Shoes will be re-released at the Chauvel Cinema, Paddington, this month. Here's what Scorsese had to say about the film to Time Out.His first impressions of The Red ShoesWhen
did it catch on here in New York? 1950? So I must have been eight or
nine. I remember abstract impressions of colour and movement. Later, it
became a very intense psychological vortex of passion, like a whirlpool
sucking in the lives and souls of these characters. I was intrigued by
the obsession, the need to dance. To be an artist. I guess it all comes
down to that wonderful exchange early in the film when Anton Walbrook
confronts Moira Shearer at a cocktail party. "Why do you want to
dance?" he asks, and she answers, "Why do you want to live?" There's no
choice about it. The look on his face is extraordinary.How the film inspires himOver the years, if I've found myself weakening, it's not that I summon up the exact atmosphere and experience of seeing The Red Shoes,
but that determined state of mind has definitely become part of who I
am. I feel that this movie has given myself and plenty of other
filmmakers the courage to keep going. It's about directing. But it's
also about a dedication to what you do. You may not do it well
[laughs], you may do it very well. But no matter what it is, you have
to do it. And often, that's a dangerous thing, not only to you, but to
the people around you.The magic of the film's colourNo,
the colour in the movie isn't realistic. But it reflects the heightened
world of the ballet, of theatre. Colour is always something that is
going to be an aesthetic comment, no matter how you do it. When you see The Red Shoes from the centre of the tenth row, you get submerged in a kind of
reality, so to speak. You see these extraordinary close-ups of these
people's faces, with this amazing make-up on their eyes and red, red
lipstick. It's so blunt. Halfway through our screening at Cannes, the
audience spontaneously applauded. I've never seen the print looking
this good.How The Red Shoes influenced Raging BullThe
movie hasn't inspired me shot by shot. But the idea of whether your
determination is going to take you off the cliff and you perish? That's Raging Bull. It's funny: when Michael Powell saw some 8mm test footage of De Niro sparring in 1978 or '79, he said,
"You know, it's interesting, this sparring, but there's one thing
wrong." I said, "What's that?" He said, "The red boxing gloves are too
red." I said, "You're absolutely right." That was one of the reasons we
decided to make it black-and-white.Why I still champion Michael PowellPeeping Tom destroyed Michael Powell's
career, and I helped get that film re-released. There was a dismissal
of his work. A great deal of it had to do with the style of filmmaking
coming out of England in the 1960s, excellent pictures like This
Sporting Life. A new realism, yes, but the filmmakers had to eschew
what came before them - a shame. We went about reclaiming those films.
I even had an Anton Walbrook (who plays the Russian ballet master in The Red Shoes)
Cossack shirt - yes, a velvet one. I still have it [laughs]. It's a
little warm. I think it had to do with the lack of central heating in
England. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Thirty-five years after Network and All the President’s Men, in which journalists told uncomfortable truths and defended democracy, Green Zone makes military personnel do the noble work which craven reporters shirk. The only consolation is that the movie is inspired by a work of journalism, Rajiv Chandrasekaran’s Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraq’s Green Zone.Set in Iraq in the months following the 2003 invasion, the film reunites the director and star of The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon; this time, however, we already know the details of the underhanded government action our hero confronts. Damon plays an army warrant officer whose WMD sorties keep coming up empty; unwilling to roll over, he’s soon embroiled in a turf war between the CIA and the Pentagon (personified by conscientious Brendan Gleeson and oleaginous Greg Kinnear) while attempting to wrangle a Ba’athist general (Igal Naor), a useful veteran (Said Faraj) and a useless embedded reporter (Amy Ryan) against a backdrop of more-or-less real events.Greengrass’s approach to real-life disaster is far more simplified and pumped up here than it was in United 93 or Bloody Sunday, but there’s much to be said for his ‘Bourne in Baghdad’ approach. The action is robust, the politics simplified but strident, insisting that a wilfully under-prepped war worked against both US and Iraqi interests. By shifting focus from the naively doctrinaire civilians of Chandrasekaran’s book to street-level soldiers questioning authority, Greengrass concocts a formula with a fighting chance of dispelling the Curse of the Hollywood Iraq Movie. If a picture as conventionally accessible as Green Zone tanks, that campaign is surely lost. Ben Walters]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[There’s tons of brooding for your buck in the hilariously earnest Remember Me, which will hopefully be revived several years from now as a beloved midnight movie. Twilight inamorato Robert Pattinson (star and executive producer) confidently sulks his way through this jaw-dropping mix of come-hither stares, “love me, Daddy!” histrionics and historical tragedy.He’s Tyler Hawkins, a gloomily soulful NYU student at odds with his businessman father (Brosnan), and who cracks Boyz II Men jokes as if he were Allen Ginsberg reading Howl. After getting into a street fight, he’s arrested by a policeman (Cooper) who—it just so happens—has a daughter (De Ravin) also enrolled at NYU. One alpha-male bet with his roommate later, Tyler’s on a retributive date…but then love begins to bloom.Sex is had, past secrets are revealed, but all is not well in Camelot, as director Allen Coulter and writer Will Fetters shamelessly hint via snatches of summer 2001 news broadcasts (it’s a period piece, see) and a telegraphing glimpse at a certain pair of buildings. I can’t say any more beyond telling you that I came out of the screening with an ear-to-ear grin I don’t usually get from even great movies. Bless you, R.Patz &amp; Co., because this gloriously steaming pile is officially in the bad-movies-we-love pantheon. Keith Uhlich]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Brothers captures the fallout in when a soldier
(Tobey Maguire) goes missing in Afghanistan and his wife (Natalie Portman) becomes
close to his brother (Jake Gyllenhaal) back home in the US. Irish director Jim Sheridan, 60, a master of the searing kitchen-sink drama, explains to Time Out why he remade Susanne Bier's 2004 Danish film of the same name.You've just got off a flight from the US. Do you work on films when you fly? Back in the day when I was younger and I was
writing My Left Foot,
we were on the runway and taking off and if you're in any way scared it
activates something in your mind for writing. There's conflict and deep
fear in the air. It kind of puts you in that space between life and
death.Does a sense of mortal danger make it harder to concentrate? No,
I think it focuses you. I live off adrenaline. It's only when the
adrenaline's going that I'm clear up top. So maybe that's a fuckin'
childhood trauma, or something.Do you ever watch films on planes? No, very rarely. But I saw The Hangover on a plane which I loved. The structure is brilliant where they wake up and they can't remember anything... My life's occasionally a little like that.How were you first introduced to Susanne Bier's version of Brothers? I watched it in my house on tape. I thought it was rather good,
and when I heard they wanted to remake it I thought I could do
something different with it. I liked the idea of the main character
being put in a place beyond life and death, where whatever choice he
makes is going to be wrong.What appealed to you about it? Well,
the brothers having a fight appealed to me. Sibling rivalry in general
- I know a bit about that. The family story too. The ability to say
something about post-traumatic stress was interesting. You didn't write it. Did you ever want to? Of
course, but here's the thing: if you're a director, you won't get a
credit for writing in the current system. It's impossible in America.
You just won't get credit.I don't understand. Why? What
used to happen was that the producers and directors used to bend the
arms of the writers to get a credit. The Writers' Guild acted the
opposite way - they didn't want credit for directors and producers. So,
even if you go in and rewrite everything, they'll still say it wasn't
your idea. Not unless you go into an arbitration where you produce a 50-page
document on what you wrote and what you didn't write, then three
members of the Writers' Guild say yes or no. Basically, it's like a
court case. But I do feel that the
director is the main creative force in the movie making process, so it
doesn't really matter.So do you feel you're more of a writer or a director? The weird thing is, I wrote My Left Foot, The Field, In the Name of the Father, The Boxer and In America, and luckily enough, all of them got nominated for Oscars...except The Boxer,
which got some Golden Globes. Even then, people still only look at me
as a director and not a writer. And when they hear me talking, they
think I'm totally inarticulate! Writing is easier. You can slack off.
You get up when you want, get a coffee and a paper, then I'll come back
via the bookies, then before you know it, it's four o'clock in the
afternoon, you know?Where did you set Brothers? It's not obvious from watching it. The
weird thing is, I didn't set it anywhere. When people asked me where it
was set, I said "California", because I didn't want anyone to do
accents. Having a voice coach wandering around the set saying "accent,
accent, accent" drives me nuts. One of the producers of Brothers said that the fact the film involves the war in Afghanistan is not important. He said Tobey Maguire's character could have suffered in any traumatic situation. Do you agree with that? More
or less. Yet, I don't think Tobey Maguire would have been as affected if he'd been in a car crash or something.
We're in a war where there are no rules. Choosing heroic suicide or
life - it's a hard choice. Suicide bombers I'm not into. I think it's
a bit of a cop out.What research did you do for your portrayal of the Afghan militants in the film? We
just read up as much as we could about the Taliban really. And a little
bit on Al-Qaeda. But, at the end of the day, it's an imaginative thing
where you're taking an idea and just running it. I mean, are they
stereotypical Al-Qaeda guys? I dunno. David Jenkins]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Finally: a French movie for the subtitle-averse. Welcome is set in Calais, where refugees from different nations converge to find a way into England. French may be the language of diplomacy, but English is the common tongue of the desperate and dispossessed. Bilal (Firat Ayverdi), a 17-year-old Kurd, has the 500 euros he needs to pay a smuggler to get him onboard a truck and through the Channel Tunnel, but when the plan comes unstuck he has an idea so suicidal it might just work: why not swim to England? He pays local swim coach Simon Calmat (Vincent Lindon) for some lessons. Simon is a former swimming champ pushing 50 whose divorce from Marion (Audrey Dana) is just about to come through. The split is amicable, and there's still a spark of affection between the two, although Marion is disappointed Simon doesn't have more sympathy for asylum seekers.That's about to change. The reality of his lonely existence hitting home, Simon starts to admire Bilal's determination, and gives the youth a couch to sleep on for a few nights. But the burghers of Calais are suspicious of refugees, and Simon's neighbours are watching him closely. Philippe Lioret has directed an enjoyable melodrama about a hot-button issue, bringing to light the tragic difficulties asylum seekers go through. One gruesome fact we discover is that the "clandestines" on board trucks have to cover their heads with plastic bags when passing through border security because guards use CO2 detectors. Lindon is a tall, broad, masculine presence whose face simultaneously exudes world-weariness and hopefulness, while Ayverdi is a lovable mix of awkwardness and determination, like a Turkish Michael Cera. With its bitterly ironic title, Welcome is a film to prick the conscience of any who still believe there's such a thing as a "queue jumper". Nick Dent]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[If you'd never seen a Jean-Pierre Jeunet film then you might find Micmacs gloriously fresh and freewheeling. The director of Amélie has been delivering blackly comic stories of lovable misfits and their harebrained schemes for 20 years, ever since 1991's Delicatessen. Micmacs is not his best work, but it's an inventively skittish journey with a serious message about arms dealing.The movie begins in Hurt Locker territory. A bomb disposal expert in Morocco is killed by a mine. Back in Paris, his wife is driven catatonic with shock and his young son, Bazil, is packed off to a Catholic boarding school.Thirty years later, Bazil (French superstar Dany Boon) is a video store clerk who gets caught in the crossfire of a random gun battle. With a bullet lodged in his brain, Bazil is now prone to vivid hallucinations. Like a faulty cathode ray TV, he often has to whack his forehead to clear the picture. Having lost his job, Bazil swiftly falls in with a junkyard coterie of secondhand dealers (like you do). Presided over by the matriarchal Mama Chow (Yolande Moreau), they each have powers that border on disabilities.There's a human cannonball (Jeunet's favourite actor, Dominique Pinon); a girl with a brain like a calculator (Marie-Julie Baup); and a man who can communicate only in clichés and aphorisms (Omar Sy). There's also Elastic Girl (Julie Ferrier), a contortionist whose ability to hide inside boxes and fridges comes in very handy in the elaborate caper they're about to pull.Bazil discovers that the arms manufacturer who made the landmine that killed his father is located across the road from the one that made the bullet in his brain. With his new friends he sets out to revenge himself on these two ruthless tycoons (André Dussollier and Nicolas Marie) and teach them a lesson in ethics. As this is a Jeunet film, that lesson will involve improbable tricks, crazy cons and elaborate machinery. While Jeunet's Audrey Tautou films A Very Long Engagement and Amélie are both schematic and moving, Micmacs is schematic and artificial. Boon, with his hangdog looks and Buster Keatonish pratfalls, is engaging, but his zany friends never exhibit any character traits beyond zaniness. Jeunet has fashioned another cinematic perpetual motion machine, but this time the cogs are showing. Nick Dent]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[War movies are a minefield. Either the grim truth of battle gets muddied by an audience's expectations of happy endings (clear-cut heroes and villains and good triumphing over evil), or the weight of history crushes story and turns a worthy tale into a cinema bomb.The last Australian war film, 2006's Kokoda - directed by Alister Grierson, who is currently in Queensland helming $30 million 3D epic Sanctum for producer James Cameron - was typical of a film caught in the Art vs Truth crossfire, sacrificing cohesive story for co-funding (and thus meddling) from the Australian War Memorial.But Australia's latest war film, Beneath Hill 60, sidesteps expectation. "If this story wasn't true," says star Brendan Cowell, "you dead-set wouldn't believe it."He's right. Who knew a company of WWI Aussie diggers was responsible for what was then the largest man-made explosion in history, a 1917 detonation that smashed open the German frontline and led directly to the Allies' victory the next year?Not even renaissance man Cowell, 34. "The fact this beautiful, complicated, demented, heroic story was virtually untold until now tells me we've all been too caught up in our double mortgages and decorating our personal playgrounds to care about real Australian stories and dark parts of our history," the poet, playwright, director and soon-to-be-author says.Beneath Hill 60 - based on a book by Will Davies - casts Cowell as Captain Oliver Woodward - "miner turned soldier turned strategist turned killer" - and commander of the 1st Australian Tunnelling Division, a motley crew of former miners turned soldiers who fought a silent, terrifying war 30 metres under the Western Front."These were the original 'Diggers' - men dealing with the huge psychological issues of war through camaraderie, humour, humility and chivalry," says Cowell, who admits he based his characterisation of Woodward on ex-Australian cricket captain, Steve Waugh, the modern personification of ANZAC credos "courage, endurance, mateship, sacrifice".
The cast - which includes Gyton Grantley, Aden Young and Anthony Hayes - did their damnedest to live and breathe ANZAC hardship. "The boys went off on a week-long boot camp, sleeping rough, firing shotguns and drinking rum out of billycans," Cowell laughs.Director Jeremy Sims engineered a "brutal" shoot that left Cowell and co "thrashed, battered and bruised". "From Scene One, we shelved egos and vowed ‘No whinging, no complaints, no cabaret'... but it's hard to maintain the 1,000-yard stare of an ANZAC when there's a French chef and make-up truck on standby." Angus Fontaine

      <review><![CDATA[Russia, 1910. In his old age, Leo Tolstoy has become so famous worldwide that the merest hint he’s about to pop his clogs sends newsreel cameras gathering in anticipation. The real story though, as this slightly fusty drama elaborates, is unfolding inside the Tolstoy household, where the octogenerian writer (Christopher Plummer, authentically beardy) finds himself in the centre of a dispute over the valuable publishing rights to 'War and Peace'. The Tolstoyan political movement – an organisation espousing his ideas on communal property to combat social injustice – sense a major funding opportunity should Tolstoy sign his best-known book over to their leader Chertkov (Paul Giamatti), yet Tolstoy’s aristocratic wife Sofya (Helen Mirren), having delivered him 13 children, is determined to fight her corner to the bitter end.

Idealism versus family ties makes for a potentially juicy set-to, yet it’s the historical detail which keeps this adaptation of Jay Parini’s novel relatively intriguing, rather than merely stodgy. Writer-director Michael Hoffman is all reverence towards Tolstoy himself, but curiously supercilious towards the beliefs of the Tolstoyan movement, thus undermining the key subplot (eager young acolyte James McAvoy gets his dream job as the great man’s secretary, but must also spy on him) and unfairly loading the central conflict in favour of ferocious spouse Mirren. Her impressively projected performance becomes the dominating factor, causing Plummer to overdo it, and sidelining both the earnestly wet McAvoy and moustache-twirling Giamatti. Engaging performers all, but the movie’s superficial flummery is slightly exasperating when the true-life events would have provided an even richer palette of ideas. Trevor Johnston]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[To justify taking up 100 minutes of your life a movie ought to show you at least one thing you've never seen before. On the entrance of Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), the 11-year-old, cute-as-a-button angel of death in Kick-Ass, I was ready to call it a fair exchange. This fille fatale - four foot nothing, livid purple wig, armed to the teeth - dispatches bad guys with guns, knives, grenades and salty remarks (you haven't heard a little girl curse like this since The Exorcist). Trained in violent vigilantism by her crazed ‘Big Daddy' (Nicolas Cage), a disgruntled ex-cop, Hit Girl is a walking DOCS nightmare; the sweetest l'il psychopath in New York City. We meet this lethal poppet when she comes to the rescue of Kick-Ass, a wannabe superhero who has wandered recklessly into an enclave of hardened drug dealers. Decked out in a ludicrous green wetsuit bought online, Kick-Ass is really Dave Lizewski, a high school comic book freak whose only superpowers are invisibility to girls and hyper-inflated optimism. (He's played by the likable Aaron Johnson, who does American geek as convincingly as he did nascent Beatle in Nowhere Boy.) After one humiliation too many, Dave invents his alter-ego, obtains a couple of ninja sticks and sets out into the night, pausing only to set up Kick-Ass's MySpace profile. On his second mission, Kick-Ass rescues a man from three assailants while a café full of onlookers records the incident on their mobiles. Now an overnight YouTube phenomenon, Kick-Ass catches the attention of local crime boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), whose couriers have been encountering mysterious costumed resistance. D'Amico's spoiled son Chris (Superbad's marvellously dweebish Christopher Mintz-Plasse) happens to attend the same school as Dave, and has a plan to catch the unwitting amateur crusader for his dad.When he's not dressing up like Jacques Cousteau, Dave is trying to win the affections of schoolmate Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca), who has erroneously adopted him as her "gay BFF". (The movie knowingly incorporates the X-Men subtext of costumed heroics as a code for queerness.) His desire to impress Katie with his manliness is leading him into a world of pain, where seriously evil people clash with heavily armed killers like Hit Girl and Big Daddy.  There's a grand tradition of European directors - Paul Verhoeven, Luc Besson - approaching American action films with an irreverent, off-kilter sadism that often strikes a chord with the public. Vaughn, the British director of Layer Cake, has no qualms about ruffling American sensibilities in his faithful adaptation of the savagely silly Kick-Ass comic book by Scotsman Mark Millar. With its prepubescent girl killer, allusions to online jihadist executions and superhero aspirations that fall to earth spectacularly, Kick-Ass seems to have cult hit written all over it, except that in this interactive age, cults have gone mainstream. The box office should be massive. Nick Dent]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[There are those of us who can watch brainy Tina Fey bobble around 30 Rock for hours, and drink up her every self-deprecating zinger like freshly brewed espresso. (As for the others who don’t get her—we understand Sarah Palin has a new show.) Still, there’s no reason why Fey, so dynamic on the small screen, has to get Anistoned out of a proper Hollywood crossover. Baby Mama (2008) was cringingly mediocre; indeed, one has to cast back to 2004’s tangy, Fey-scripted Mean Girls to get a reasonable glimmer of her talent. Even then, we were still watching Lindsay Lohan.
Date Night isn’t going to alter this conundrum—it makes you laugh in fits and starts, but more often it feels toothless and exhausted, the kind of project that exists to give Ray Liotta work. (The generic script is by Shrek-sequel scribe Josh Klausner.)
Fey is almost perfectly paired with Steve Carell as bored, married New Jerseyites Claire and Phil: The way they trade quips and cast snide aspersions at strangers, the actors seem totally believable as intellectual mates and, more crucially, deeply in danger of losing intimacy. After stealing a reservation at a clichéd-snobby NYC eatery, the couple is mistaken for blackmailers and pursued by goons, North by Northwest–style, throughout the city.
You know where this is going; shouty misadventures in a slow-moving motorboat, a clamorous car chase and an exclusive sex club will surely move them out of the “most excellent roommates” category. When Mark Wahlberg shows up as a shirtless tech-heavy spy—one who can also flirt in Hebrew—he almost constitutes a joke in himself. But can’t there at least be faster fish for Fey and Carell to shoot in the barrel? Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The stylish opening of The Book of Eli - a lateral camera track through an ashen forest - attests to the spellbinding talents of ace cinematographer Don Burgess. His moody and immersive visuals (most notably a shoot-out filmed, Children of Men-style, in an illusory single take) lend weight to this otherwise rote postapocalyptic tale from Allen and Albert Hughes (From Hell).
A mean motherfuckin’ servant of God (Washington) shepherds a mysterious book to some unknown locale out West. (The tome’s identity is fairly obvious, despite the calculatedly hushed, oblique tones used to speak about it.) After a stopover in a decrepit outpost, the holy warrior attracts the attention of a snake-tongued saloon owner (Oldman) who wants to use the book for his own diabolical purposes. Cue guns-’n’-ammo showdowns, not to mention voluminous product placement - the J.Crew and Motorola conglomerates bedevil us even in the end-times.
A spunky sidekick (Kunis’s irritating barmaid) and character-role cameos (Michael Gambon, Malcolm McDowell and Tom Waits) round out this vision of a world where “Ring My Bell” played on an antique Victrola is meant to stoke nostalgia. Thank the pallid green heavens for Flashdance’s Jennifer Beals, positively ravishing as a sightless kept woman who acts as the story’s oracle. She wanders the halls of her makeshift prison like a goddess deprived of power, and ultimately takes an elatingly bloodless revenge on her captor. For a few brief moments, the film becomes something close to Greek mythology, as opposed to graphic-novel imitator. What a feeling! Keith Uhlich]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Eighties Hollywood was a crazy kind of place where mannequins became real girls, people swapped bodies and genders, high school seniors acquired the ability to open bras with telekenesis, and mogwai should never, ever be fed after midnight. There was no male sexual neurosis that screenwriters could not compensate for with an improbable high concept. This is the territory that Steve Pink's Hot Tub Time Machine is mining in its story of directionless 40 year olds who find themselves back in the 80s with the chance to rewrite their own fates. It's Back to the Future infused with the fratboy spirit of Animal House, and a comedy that is smart enough to embrace its own stupidity and run with it.  Adam (John Cusack) has just had another relationship break up, and can't shake the feeling he should never have dumped his high school sweetheart Jennie (Lyndsy Fonseca). Nick (Craig Robinson) has a dead-end job in a pooch pampering parlour and wishes he'd never quit his music career. Lou (Rob Corddry) is a rampaging party monster whose hedonism masks an inner emptiness. When Lou parties a little too hard one evening and ends up in hospital, Adam has the idea of a therapeutic sentimental journey back to the ski lodge where as teens they once had their best holiday ever. They bring along for the ride Adam's 20-year-old nephew Jake (Clark Duke) in the hope he'll drop his Nintendo and pop his cherry. After an all-night binge in their suite's hot tub they find themselves back in 1986. The clothes are garish, the president's an actor, mobile phones are gigantic and so is the hair. Should the boys remake their lives anew, or focus on getting back to 2010 while being careful not to affect the future? In the meantime they must navigate all the familiar tropes from 80s teen sex comedies: nasty jocks, Cold War paranoia, and sexually compliant girls ready to redeem nerds with their fleshy favours. A patron saint of bad 80s movies, Chevy Chase, appears as the mysterious hot tub repairman, and Back to the Future's Crispin Glover plays a happy-go-lucky bellhop destined to meet with a nasty accident.Hot Tub Time Machine might be irredeemable trash if it wasn't fast, funny and packed with killer one-liners delivered by a cast of seasoned comics. (The Office's Robinson is especially good.) Crude and crass it may be, but it never sinks to the leaden depths of an actual 80s teen comedy. There's also a sadness behind its knockabout, wish-fulfilment antics: the desperation of Adam, Nick and Lou to reclaim their masculinity from the ravages of time - the ultimate buzzkiller. Forty-year-old yobs rejoice: your ultimate guilty pleasure movie has arrived. Nick Dent]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The X-Men, Spider-Man and Batman movies have proven that the second instalment is where a comic-book blockbuster series finds its feet: with all those pesky origin details out of the way, the filmmakers can focus on raising the stakes, deepening the characters and ramping up the action. And for the first 45 minutes or so, this is where Iron Man 2 looks to be heading. Director Jon Favreau sets the stage for a titanic three-way conflagration as Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is under investigation by the US government following the public revelation of his superhero persona, while his arch rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) is scrambling after his technology and mysterious, musclebound Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) is up to unspecified no-good. The dialogue crackles, the special effects pop and the onscreen action never flags, climaxing with an astonishing multi-car pileup at the Monaco Grand Prix, where Iron Man meets his nemesis Vanko, aka Whiplash, for the first time. So far, so excellent: Favreau builds on the solid foundations of the first movie, and success looks guaranteed. But slowly, imperceptibly, it all starts to fall apart during the remaining hour or so. A major problem is the number of characters: Downey, Rockwell and Rourke are obviously all enjoying themselves enormously, but the same can’t be said for Don Cheadle as Stark’s redundant buddy-cum-sidekick Rhodes. Nor do the others seem to be having much fun: Gwyneth Paltrow is underused as Stark's assistant-cum-love interest Pepper Potts, while Scarlett Johansson’s Natalie is slinky but pointless. The less said about a perfunctory appearance from Samuel L Jackson as some sort of shady inter-agency bigwig the better. As the film plays out, it starts to look likely that all the rumours of reshoots and recuts weren’t just online rabble-rousing. Characters appear and vanish. Seemingly important plot details surface and are swept away. And this feels increasingly like a film which got lost in the edit. Whereas in the first act we jetted from Siberia to Washington to Monaco, the second half is mostly confined to a series of boardrooms, army bases and laboratories. A flat, studio-bound final showdown takes an age to arrive and is over in minutes. Iron Man 2 is a lot of fun: it’s shiny, likeable and never boring. But it’s also wildly uneven and unnecessarily convoluted, leaving the viewer unsatisfied and hungry for something more substantial. Let’s hope a promised third instalment can fulfil the series’ undeniable potential. Tom Huddleston]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[By the standards of British comic films, Bunny &amp; the Bull is formally adventurous, thematically conventional and emotionally tending towards the inert. Just as problematically, it’s not very funny. Bringing together elements of buddy flick, road movie and romance, its story follows meek, self-conscious Stephen (Edward Hogg) and his brash, hard-living pal Bunny (Simon Farnaby) on a ramshackle European tour, with Spanish waitress Eloisa (Veronica Echegui) tagging along for the ride. Their escapades are recalled from the interior of Stephen’s flat, which he hasn’t left in the year since the trip ended, and where he keeps everything from shower caps to urine neatly archived.

Director Paul King is a longtime collaborator of comedy duo The Mighty Boosh, whose TV series and live tours he directed (and who have characteristically outré cameos here). Like ‘Boosh’, Bunny &amp; the Bull revels in a playfully expressionistic milieu of stylised settings and handmade effects, realised here through various kinds of animation that bring Michel Gondry to mind; a clockwork fairground and cutlery-derived bull stand out, as does the desk-based credit sequence. The film’s action also elides the distinctions between reality, memory and delusion in an impressively sustained manner more familiar to stage than screen.

Much to appreciate, then, but less to enjoy. Bunny and Stephen remain largely if differently unsympathetic during their Withnail-esque travels and travails, and there’s little sense of passion in the latter’s tentative romance with Eloisa. Like him, the movie remains mired in a mood of frustration and mopiness that works against both emotional engagement and big laughs, however consistently tickling the picture’s narrative schema and production design might be.Ben Walters]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[Robin Hood]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[Burdened by the weight of
expectation, Robin Hood is over
long, overblown, and over hyped. As a result, this archer misses the bullseye.  The film starts promisingly
enough. After some Blackadder-y
Medieval scrolls set the olde worlde scene, we meet Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe), a
humble and courageous archer fighting the Crusades in France for Richard the
Lionheart (a very under-the-radar Danny Huston). When the king is killed in
battle, a decisive and brass-necked Longstride takes advantage of implausibly fortuitous coincidence to escape the
army and return to England considerably higher of rank and with a band of merry men.  But all is not so merry back
home. Bankrupted by the cost of the Crusades, the ambitious and head-strong new King John imposes
stringent taxes to recoup the losses, which brings an already struggling
country to its knees and on the brink of civil war.  France, sensing weakness and
in-fighting, hatches plans to invade England thanks to their man on the inside,
the double-crossing and self-serving British noble, Godfrey (Mark Strong).  In successfully re-uniting a
fractured country to see off the French, Robin enjoys a meteoric rise from foot
soldier to national hero. But King John, threatened by this new leader's sudden
popularity and unimpressed by his lack of nobility, casts him aside. This, then, is the origin
story behind the legend: the prequel that explains (with a fair amount of
literary license) how Robin Longstride the archer may have become Robin Hood
the outlaw. In ending where all the other Hoods have begun, director Ridley
Scott has probably engineered himself a new franchise. But in blowing over $140m on
this 140-minute epic, one could argue he himself has robbed from the rich and given us
something poor.  The main problem is, by once
again casting Crowe as an heroic warrior fighting all the odds for an honourable
cause, comparisons to Scott's Gladiator are unavoidable. (Oscar Isaac's King John shares more than a little DNA
in common with Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus, for example.) But next to The
Spaniard, this Englishman doesn't quite measure up. Nor, for that matter, is he as good
as Mel Gibson's William Wallace in Braveheart.
The Robin Hood plot is convoluted and at times ponderous, the battle scenes are a dizzying shakycam chaos of arrows and clanging metal, and several key characters remain disappointingly underdeveloped. We see little of Little John and the Sheriff of Nottingham barely features in this prequel – which is a shame. And just what are those
voices supposed to be? Scott's Robin Hood doesn't really know where he is from.
And judging from his accent, which veers laughably from Scouse to Scottish via ee-bah-gum
Yorkshire, neither do we. Perhaps this is deliberate, indicative of the
itinerant lifestyle of a career soldier. As Hood discovers by piecing together some submerged
flashback memories and exhuming long-buried emotions, he is from Nottingham. Which is, of course,
where he meets an ice maiden called Marian (Cate Blanchett), a blanched-out woman of nobility
who has fallen on tough times. But even her accent, while more consistent,
occasionally grates. When she yells "y'bastads!" at some looters who have stolen
her seed grain, our Cate sounds like a screeching council estate chav.  So what are the saving
graces? Though there is little
apparent chemistry between Robin and a very washed-out looking Marian, it's interesting to
have the two main characters played by seasoned pros who look battle-hardened
and, let's face it, a bit old. There is a realism to their relationship.
They don't so much fall in love as settle for each other. A formidable woman,
Blanchett is more than a ditzy love-interest. (Thank goodness they dropped the
originally-cast Sienna Miller.) Having wasted 10 years of her life waiting for
her husband who will never return from the Crusades, Marian pragmatically takes
what's on offer with an air of resignation. Well, she ain't getting any
younger.  For his part, Crowe looks
steely and stacked, every inch the leading man. He has lost a Friar Tuck-load of weight to be in his best shape in a decade – yes, since Gladiator.  Mark Strong gets strong
marks, cementing his growing reputation as the baddest villain on the big
screen. Without giving too much away, the expression on his face in his final
scene is wonderfully sinister.  And to his great credit, Scott
avoids the temptation to resort to Hollywood schmaltz and cliché (unlike Gladiator). Although half an hour too long, Robin Hood is a
gritty period drama with no room for romance. Even the final kiss at the film's denouement is tinged
with the metallic taste of blood.  If you are going to see Robin Hood,
don't wait for the DVD. While the set does look like a Disneyfied rendering of
Medieval England at times, visually the film has that epic quality that only
really works on the big screen.
The film as a whole is not terrible by any means. It's just not as good
as it should be. Go and see it without any high expectations whatsoever and you
won't feel robbed.Dan Rookwood]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In Wes Craven’s 1984 original, Nancy warned her boyfriend Glen,  a young Johnny Depp: "Whatever happens, don’t fall asleep." Heed this warning if you see this tedious ‘reimagining’ of Craven’s seminal slasher movie, because you’ll be struggling to stay awake. Inheriting Freddy Krueger’s iconic fedora and striped sweater from Robert Englund, former child star Jackie Earle Haley makes what he can of a hand-me-down role, slicing his way into the dreams of suburban teenagers. That said, Haley’s CGI-enhanced make-up makes more of an impression than his weak presence, ‘scary’ voice or lame one-liners.

After their friend is killed by an invisible attacker, emo girl Nancy (Rooney Mara) and misfit Quentin (Kyle Gallner) are convinced that her death is connected to a nightmare they’ve all been having and a dark Freddy Krueger-related secret their parents have kept from them – a secret the kids have all, in a convenient act of collective amnesia, repressed since nursery school. Now Freddy is back, invading their dreams and threatening to kill them in their sleep.

The makers clearly couldn’t decide between a prequel or remake, so they and first-time director Samuel Bayer have jammed both together. Heather Langenkamp’s wimpy portrayal of Nancy was the original’s weak point, and here Mara’s Nancy slips between the somnambulant and the catatonic. This is the worst yet from Michael Bay’s horror production company Platinum Dunes, which also brought you rubbish re-makes of Halloween and Friday the 13th.Nigel Floyd]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[Harry Brown]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[I ended up feeling a bit sorry for Michael Caine by the time this hateful vigilante flick set in modern-day London came to a close. Did the old boy know what he was getting into? The funny thing is that Harry Brown, bar a violent prologue, begins fairly soberly, even reflectively, as if the makers were thinking more of All or Nothing than Death Wish. Harry (Caine, below) is a widower who shuffles around a crumbling housing estate with only fellow army vet Leonard (David Bradley) for company. But life changes when Leonard falls prey to the hoodies who linger in the local underpass. When distraught Harry gets short shrift from the police (badly written, and poorly played by Emily Mortimer and Charlie Creed-Miles), he decides to take the law into his own hands and drives this already wobbly wagon straight into hysterical genre territory. By now, all you can do is sigh, laugh and try not to get upset at the stupidity of it all.

Although it takes a while before Harry Brown shows its true colours, there’a a vulgar whiff from the off: in the first seconds of this debut from director Daniel Barber (who, technically, shows a fair amount of talent) we watch grainy mobile footage of a kid on a scooter as he confronts a young mum and shoots her dead before he comes a cropper himself on the road. It’s horrible stuff, but there must be a good reason for it, surely?

As it turns out, this scene is the first hint of the sick ideology of the film, in which ill-informed pessimism is bolstered by childish ideas of revenge. There’s always a punishment around the corner, not only to avenge bad behaviour but also to give the makers sneaky licence to indulge in violence. As narrative – and moral – maths go, this is a cooking of the books that sidesteps any smart commentary on real life.

      <review><![CDATA[Hands up who ever thought they’d see the director of Four Weddings and a Funeral making a Jerry Bruckheimer movie – and a video game adaptation to boot? As with his instalment in the 'Harry Potter’ saga, Mike Newell was clearly brought in to add a touch of dramatic gravitas to this flimsiest of summer blockbusters. It’s a strategy which pays off – but only just.

The plot feels cobbled together from myriad sources: a pinch of The Thief of Baghdad, a smattering of The Mummy and a hefty dollop of The Thousand and One Nights. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Dastan, a one-time street urchin (natch) elevated to Persian Princeling by the generosity of good King Sharaman. But when Dastan goes against his two brothers and their scheming uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley, whose moustache is just too short to twirl malevolently), he’s framed for the king’s murder and flees into the desert with only his camel and a bad-tempered princess (Gemma Arterton) for company. 

As this synopsis suggests, Newell and his screenwriters leave no historical fantasy cliché unmolested, and that’s before we get to the mystical dagger, the supernatural assassins and Alfred Molina as a jolly, morally dubious gambler. The story does feel overfamiliar and suffers from a lack of dramatic tension as a consequence. Matters aren’t helped by shoddy CGI and some seriously silly last-act developments.

But Newell keeps things moving at a lick, barely allowing his actors a pause for breath between bouts of knockabout banter before chucking them into another athletic action scene. And Gyllenhaal is good value, his natural vulnerability working to offset some slightly alarming action-hero abs. Prince of Persia won’t linger long in the memory – but then it probably wasn’t meant to. Tom Huddleston]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Once upon a time, a nebbishy New Yorker could fall for a willowy shiksa goddess and you could call it Annie Hall. No longer. Now, the whole movie’s got to be set in Los Angeles (not just one Christmas sequence), our love object barely gets a single “la-di-da,” and forget about naming the film after her. We’ve got inner male pain to address.
That shift, though, is precisely what makes Greenberg, Noah Baumbach’s latest comedy-drama, so car-crash-arresting and emblematic of Gen X self-absorption. Baumbach, an expert at skewering urbane pretensions (The Squid and the Whale), has conceived a remarkably sour character in Ben Stiller’s furious letter writer and fortyish layabout, Roger Greenberg. Once a college-rock musician, he scotched his band’s momentum in a fit of principle and now suffers the consequences: occasional work at carpentry and pride-swallowing in the home of his much wealthier brother. A ratty Steve Winwood T-shirt speaks volumes, as does a shelf of meds and a constant stream of bile directed at partygoing kids who scare him with their potential. Roger’s just not fun to be around.
Baumbach’s idea here is to find an expiration date on boyishness—it’s tempting to compare Greenberg to the more-trenchant The Anniversary Party (2001), also a shrewd examination of the limits of youthful decadence (and partly created by the filmmaker’s wife, Jennifer Jason Leigh, as is this). This movie corrects its wobbly, negative spiral with the romantic development of Florence (Gerwig, spacey as ever), a personal assistant to Roger’s sib and perhaps a salvation. Scratch that perhaps: Greenberg only slightly misses the top flight by settling for too weak a foil. (The better option, Rhys Ifans’s bruised bandmate, is right there.) But when Stiller indulges in moments of unfulfilled rage, this has real desperation. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

Except that she's not snoozing; she has overdosed, fatally, on heroin, and her son doesn't quite know what to do next. So he calls his estranged grandma, Janine ‘Smurf' Cody (Jacki Weaver), who tells him to pack his bags, and gently, reassuringly invites him into the lions' den.

Janine lives with her three sons, J's uncles - the young one, Craig (Luke Ford), the nervous one, Darren (Sullivan Stapleton) and the ringleader, Andrew ‘Pope' Cody (Ben Mendelsohn). The Cody boys, together with Barry Brown (Joel Edgerton), are notorious armed robbers, under constant police surveillance. Crime isn't paying like it used to, and Barry wants to go straight, but Pope doesn't know any other life. A drug user with huge personality problems, Pope is the alpha male of the pack, and ashen-faced Mendelsohn plays him as a moral blank, a man staring into the abyss, jumping at shadows.

When one of their gang is killed by police, Pope's vengeance is swift and brutal, and J finds himself an accessory to murder. Enter Detective Senior Sergeant Nathan Leckie (Guy Pearce), who hopes to convince J to testify against the family. There's a difference between being strong, he explains to J, and the illusion of strength from being under the protection of the seemingly strong. J is no fool and realises that Uncle Pope would kill him at the slightest suspicion of grassing. What's a boy got to do to survive?

Drawn from the recent history of Melbourne's gangland, former Inside Film editor David Mîchod's debut feature outshines any crime thriller ever made in this country. Mîchod spent nine years honing his screenplay and it shows. Miraculously cliché-free, its every scene is surprising yet believable, building to an epic climax hinged on revelations about character. Mendelsohn is chilling, and newcomer James Frecheville is excellent as J, moving from inarticulate teen observer to trapped participant. Even better is Jacki Weaver as Smurf, the mother hen to this family of rotten eggs. Doting, chirpy and kissy-kissy, she smiles like a pixie but her eyes are as cold as a shark's. It's a magnificent performance by one of our national treasures.

Destined to be an international arthouse hit, this portrayal of power struggles in an underworld dynasty may be the closest thing we get to an Australian Godfather. Of course, while those smart capitalists the Corleones thrive and prosper, the small-time Codys are on the way out – but no species of carnivore surrenders to extinction without a fight. Nick Dent

      <name><![CDATA[I Am Love]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[A work of masterly daring and skill, the new Italian film I Am Love plays out in the late 1990s within a super-rich family called the Recchis. Their power base is a Milanese villa introduced to us by young director Luca Guadagnino as a gilded cage – a marble-and-stone palace too large and ornate to support intimate family life. In the film’s early scenes Guadagnino laps up this mansion, exploring it with a swirling, fluid camera that turns its world into a character itself. The fictional Recchis recall the Agnellis,  another troubled industrialist family which feathered its nest on the back of fascism, but they trade in textiles, not cars, and Guadagnino gives us a brief shot of their mechanised looms at work to stress how business is woven into the fabric of this family’s soul.

We meet the Recchis on the cusp of change – and change is the film’s main interest, along with the dangerous strength necessary for any woman to counter the forces of tradition and expectation in such a family. We begin by watching the elderly family head (Gabriele Ferzetti) at dinner as he nominates his successors in a scene of ‘King Lear’-like power and unnaturalness. But soon he is dead and our focus and heroine becomes Emma Recchi (Tilda Swinton), the dutiful Russian wife of Tancredi (Pippo Delbono), the family’s new head, and mother to two grown-up sons and a daughter attempting her own flight from this patriarchal world. Emma’s burgeoning friendship with her son’s business partner, Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini), a rural chef, is the nudge that will bring this house of cards down in dramatic, tragic fashion. 

The story is bold enough, but true daring is at play in the film’s style. Guadagnino has the confidence to mix big, brash ‘Dallas’-style establishing shots of Milan and London and complicated scenes of busy parties with much more intimate, expressive moments. Dialogue becomes less important as the film progresses, and Guadagnino invites us to read the film rather than the characters’ lips. He also manages to bring the film to an operatic crescendo without losing sight of emotional realities.

There are many reasons to recommend this sensual and good-looking film about personal and female liberation. The music is one; it is central to a work that demands that all the film’s elements work together to create a total cinema. Guadagnino and his star and co-producer, Swinton, persuaded John Adams, the composer of operas such as Nixon in China and Doctor Atomic, to allow his work to be used in a film for the first time and his crashing, arresting, impulsive music is gripping from the start.

It’s a fitting collaboration. Adams has given modern opera a much-needed shot in the arm and that’s what Swinton (who speaks Italian throughout) and Guadagnino are striving to achieve: ‘I Am Love’ is a brazen blueprint for a cinema that straddles past and future while worrying little about trends of the present. It’s a bold experiment rooted in tradition. It plays like smart opera and looks like a marriage of poetic documentary with classical European drama. Swinton and Guadagnino call it ‘Visconti on acid’ and that’s as good a phrase as any to describe the film’s intoxicating allure. Dave Calhoun]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Banksy has a weird relationship with fame. Let’s call it the ‘reverse Lohan’: he’s famous for not being famous. He breeds celebrity then rejects it. Just last year he was the subject of an odd film made by the ICA’s ex-chairman Ivan Massow called Banksy’s Coming to Dinner, in which an actor duped Joan Collins into believing she was hosting a dinner party for the street artist. All signs suggest Collins was party to the gag. But was Banksy also in on it? Probably not. But still it fed his notoriety.
His anonymity is a handy tease – a tool which allows him to draw attention to himself while at the same time deflecting it.
This is the spirit of Exit through the Gift Shop, a new documentary brought to us by Banksy but not directed by him (the film has no such credit). It profiles Banksy and prods at issues raised by his success, from originality to commercialisation. But it’s a wonky, sideways profile in that the film pretends not to be about Banksy.
He – or whoever made the film – employs a fall guy to make himself look good. It's passive self-promotion. Some even say it's a hoax. But that’s missing the point: even if the final section of the film doesn’t feel as honest as the earlier parts, there’s nothing to suggest that the whole thing is made up (which is different from savvy editing and presentation). Part of the problem is that we expect a Banksy project to be a joke on us. Whatever the film is, it’s sparky and funny and invigorating to watch.
The fall guy – Banksy’s mirror – is Thierry Guetta, a hipster French exile in Los Angeles introduced to us from the beginning as obsessed with video cameras and looking for an outlet for a creeping early middle-aged ennui. Essentially the film has two narrators: Rhys Ifans, buoying the story along in voiceover, and Banksy, who pops up occasionally in silhouette to offer commentary. Both lend their voice to a mass of archive footage, much of it shot by Guetta, who, we’re told, started filming his cousin Invader (the French bloke who plasters mosaics everywhere) in the late 90s and moved on to other artists, including Shepard Fairey and Banksy.
We’re told that after many years of filming these artists on roofs, at night or in their studios, Guetta edited his footage into a mess called Life Remote Control. Which is where Banksy decided to take over and turn the archive into something watchable. Which is where we join the party.
The cheeky twist in the tale is that Guetta, encouraged by Banksy, then becomes an artist too. He exhibits and sells work at a hyped-up Los Angeles show, and all the signs are that Banksy is closer to this late creative flowering than he admits. Most of Guetta’s works look like D-grade Banksy rip-offs and there’s a sense that there’s a smart mind behind this ‘bad’ work, which includes a giant aerosol can labelled with branding for ‘Campbell’s Tomato Spray’.
So, whether Guetta’s burgeoning art career is under the patronage or direction of Banksy – or both – is the question you must take away. Whatever the answer, the film is a rousing tribute to street art, a crafty autobiography and a cheeky comment on the bravado of artists, talented or otherwise, and the gullibility of their punters – us included.

      <review><![CDATA[Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her fashion-conscious gal pals are back, and they’re taking the girl-power hi-jinks to a whole new level. First things first, though: the gay, gay, gay wedding of bestest friends Anthony Marantino (Mario Cantone) and Stanford Blatch (Willie Garson), where chorus boys sing ‘Sunrise, Sunset’, swans frolic among the guests, and Liza Minnelli officiates. Watching that queerest of queer icons risk her umpteenth hip replacement by performing Beyoncé’s ‘Single Ladies’ (dance moves and all!) is as suspenseful as a Hitchcock set-piece, and a difficult act to top.

So writer-director Michael Patrick King doesn’t even try. Instead, after this camp overture, we’re plunged headfirst into Carrie and friends’ familiar mock-troubled paradise: Ms Bradshaw’s relationship with the debonair Mr Big (Chris Noth) is moving further toward stifling domesticity. Neurotic mother Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is worried her braless live-in nanny has the hots for her hubby. Lawyer Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) quits her job after too many put-downs from her chauvinist boss. And Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is, well, horny as fuck. What a great time to take an all-expenses-paid trip to Abu Dhabi!

Taken in hand by this formidable foursome, the big, bad Middle East becomes a menopausal Westerner’s delight. One wrongheaded jaw-dropper follows another, from Samantha’s description of a gay manservant as ‘Paula Abdul’ to a comic climax in which the ladies escape an angry male mob by wearing hijabs and abayas given to them by like-minded Muslim women. And the featherbrained feminism the franchise specialises in reaches its apex when Carrie files her latest book, ‘I Do. Do I?’, beside Susan Sontag’s ‘Against Interpretation’. How do you say, ‘In your dreams, girlfriend’ in Arabic? Keith Uhlich]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Married-rich radical M.I.A. might be having press problems these days, but they’re nothing compared with the pretensions of fictional rocker Aldous Snow (squirmy, effortlessly charming Brand). Get Him to the Greek opens with a devastatingly funny parody - a video for Snow’s self-serious "African Child," described by shocked music critics as the worst thing to happen to the continent since apartheid. Seven years of infamy lead the debauched frontman to agree to a comeback concert, the brainstorm of superfan label-rep Aaron (Hill). After sparring with his workaholic girlfriend (Mad Men’s Moss, an unlikely partner), Aaron is on his way to London to shepherd Snow to the L.A. concert, scheduled to occur in three days.
And we’re off. When the movie remembers to be the drug-spiked, hard-R comedy you hope for, it’s more than just a fun romp (and, incidentally, superior to Forgetting Sarah Marshall, the rom-com from which its Britpop libertine spins off). It’s an unusually fast and inventive scramble through New York TV studios and Vegas party clubs. The heavyset Hill is beginning to cultivate a likable John Candy–esque appeal; playing against the surprisingly sharp Sean Combs, as a hellacious boss, he grounds the movie in approachability as the orbiting players get crazier.
So what’s with the Almost Famous rooftop jump and bummer left-turn? Writer-director Nicholas Stoller can’t really be expecting us to view his movie as a referendum on rock &amp; roll lifestyles; relationship arguments and daddy issues begin to cloud what started out as a perfectly black-lit satire. A climactic three-way in Aaron’s apartment has less oomph than a Lars Ulrich cameo. You desperately want the movie to be bad again. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The sensitive touch of Rodrigo García—a talented HBO house director (In Treatment, Carnivàle) with an extremely spotty feature career (Nine Lives, Passengers) - keeps this gimmicky ensemble melodrama out of the bullshit-detector red zone. As in most of his films, women take center stage: Middle-aged health-care worker Karen (Bening) is the biological mother of icy power attorney Elizabeth (Watts), whom she gave up for adoption immediately after birth. In a seemingly unrelated thread, the slightly manic baker Lucy (Washington) prepares to adopt a child of her own, since she’s been unable to conceive. All three live in Los Angeles, but none of them have ever met. Uh-oh.
Much as Nine Lives hinged on an aesthetic stunt (each sequence was filmed in a single shot), Mother and Child borrows the “we’re-all-connected” converging narrative patented by executive producer Alejandro González Iñárritu (Babel). It remains an annoying, faux-profound structural tic—at this point, there are no more returns to diminish - though this doesn’t negate the stellar performances García gets from his central female trio.
Watts is the most immediately attention-grabbing, with the story dictating that Elizabeth move from legal-eagle whore of Babylon (a terrific Samuel L. Jackson plays her willing prey) to martyred, maternal saint. A believably unbalanced Bening scores the movie’s true coup: Karen’s revitalizing relationship with a sweetly persistent coworker (Jimmy Smits) is a rare example of Hollywood doing right by midlife romance. And Washington, because she’s the least caught up in the twisted-pretzel plotting, gives Lucy’s every gesture the hallmark of truth. Everything else, sad to say, is just Hallmark.

      <review><![CDATA[From the moment that DreamWorks unleashed its jolly green animated franchise in 2001, the adaptation of William Steig’s popular children’s book found that sweet spot of appeal to both parents and kids. Children got ogre-fart jokes and Eddie Murphy’s manic jackassery; adults chuckled knowingly at pomo references and the subtleties of the Gingerbread Man screaming “Eat me!” Four chapters later, any attempts at satisfying both the prepubescent and the postcollegiate mind-sets have been shrugged aside, but what’s truly head-scratching is which way the series ended up skewing.
Shrek Forever After (is that a threat?) kicks off with a montage of our hero (Myers) in a domesticated rut: feed and change the brood, go about the daily routine of middle-class indignities, have dinner with the same group of friends, rinse and repeat—ad infinitum. Finally, Shrek suffers a nervous breakdown - what else would you call a rage spiral that ends with smashing your fist into a birthday cake? - and is suckered into a Faustian bargain with Rumpelstiltskin (Dohrn). It’s one thing to sell scatological gags to grown-ups, but pitching kids a toon version of It’s a Wonderful Life? Seriously?
Such a sideways move toward maturity might be applaudable if the rest of the film weren’t just desperately beating a dead cash cow. Third times are rarely charms in the movies, much less fourth go-rounds, and it takes more than ho-hum 3D and video-game-ready action sequences to liven up diminishing returns. When a chubby tabby is given the best lines, alienating the 12-and-under set with midlife crises might be the least of your problems. David Fear]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Sunnyside, the day-care center where the delightful new Toy Story occurs, might be a paradise - especially for Woody (Hanks), Buzz (Allen) and a gang facing obsolescence. (Andy is off to college and his mom has broken out the Hefty bags.) But in the sternly orotund warning of one Mr. Pricklepants (ex-Bond Timothy Dalton), it’s “a place of ruin and despair,” peopled with violent, drooling tykes and ruled with a plush fist by Lots-o’-Huggin’ Bear (the extraordinary Beatty), whose strawberry scent and harmonica-swaddled folksiness hide a sadist.
Clearly, Pixar’s genius for adventurous storytelling continues unabated; a prison film would seem to be the furthest idea from safe, but the tale (by director Lee Unkrich, John Lasseter and Wall-E’s Andrew Stanton) poses a serious challenge to the old saw of terrible second sequels. As always, the fun with this franchise comes from elaborate sequences of escape, stressing the plastic, resourceful nature of our heroes. This third chapter has some doozies, especially the jaw-dropper where spy Mr. Potato Head slips out of his skin, reassembling in the body of a floppy tortilla. (Watch out for that pesky pigeon, though.)
Why, then, are we not quite at the highest rank? There’s no avoiding the dark twinge of rejection that such a story inevitably courts; there are moments—the toys wandering through a dump’s wasteland of fire and swirling trash—when you might be reminded of Steven Spielberg’s depressing robot fantasia Artificial Intelligence. Still, humanity shines through the brighter comic lines. “Authority derives from the consent of the governed, not by force!” shouts a small, firm voice; her name is Barbie, and even Ken is stunned.

      <review><![CDATA[Like flies to wanton schoolboys are humans to Predators – they hunt us for their sport. But at least when they drop us onto verdant alien worlds to be picked off one by one, we're given a fighting chance and allowed a full armoury of guns'n'ammo. And it's not just any old unsuspecting humans dumped onto the game reserve: it's hardened mercenaries like Royce (experienced cinematic fugitive Adrien Brody) along with murderers, kidnappers, Yakuza, and, er, doctors who are pitted against the crab-faced giants and their horned, toothsome hounds. Robert Rodriguez produces this fifth instalment in the franchise (Hungarian Nimrod Antal directs) and it's a return to the suspenseful, high-velocity form of the original Predator (1987), which gave Arnie one of his proudest pre-gubernatorial moments. It's no masterpiece, but after the cartoonish nadir of Alien vs Predator: Requiem we should be thankful that it's at least as much fun as an episode of Survivor (call it Survivor: Planet Predator). At its heart, it's a Dantean morality tale in which warlike folk of many nations are cast into a purgatory where demons can punish them for their belligerence. Certainly by the time a crazed Laurence Fishburne turns up channelling his Apocalypse Now castmate Marlon Brando, Predators starts looking like the oddest anti-war actioner of the holiday season.

      <review><![CDATA[Wasn’t it only yesterday that Dakota Fanning shrieked her way into your splitting headache in War of the Worlds? She was just 11 back then, and in this fast-and-loose dramatization of the flameout of the 1970s proto-grrrl group, she’s all of 15. Fanning’s costar, vamp bait Kristen Stewart, isn’t that much more experienced (she can vote). The two make for an uncomfortably tarted-up frontline as, respectively, blond yowler Cherie Currie and future-bad-reputation-disregarder Joan Jett. It’s exactly as it should be; the band’s story is a cautionary one. So if you feel yourself getting protective, the movie is doing its job.
The two underage characters meet, naturally, in a bar over drinks, shoved together by creepy L.A. entrepreneur Kim Fowley (Revolutionary Road’s Shannon, the only truly anarchic presence in the whole film). Soon enough, they’re crammed into a motor home with the rest of the band, working on chord ch-ch-changes and sliding inexorably toward drugs, soft-core lesbian sex and Japanese fame. As styled by video director Floria Sigismondi, the film mainly glances on these surfaces—it’s more giggly goofy than coke-in-the-bathroom naughty. (Only vinyl collectors will insist that a serious legacy has been sullied; the plot is as contrived as the group itself.)
So you don’t blink an eye when the prefab wheels run off the rails - there’s very little pathos here for something presumably informed by Currie’s 1989 memoir. Still, you do get a sense of the moment when glam was being fought out in American high schools, and teen sex was barely contained in tight pants. There’s lots of volume in these tunes - the soundtrack is killer—and at least everyone gets their rocks off. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Skin is based on the true story of Sandra Laing (Sophie Okonedo). Born in 1955 during South Africa's Apartheid era, Sandra is the daughter of white Afrikaner parents. However, due to a genetic anomaly, Sandra was born black (many Afrikaner bloodlines contain black genetic material).Sandra's stubborn father, Abraham (Sam Neill), fights the State to get her classified as officially ‘white'. Despite this, the white community refuses to accept her. Sandra eventually finds solace in a black man and elopes with him to Swaziland. Abraham disowns her and forces his wife (Alice Krige) to cut all ties.Anthony Fabian heard Sandra's story ten years ago in a radio interview and was instantly inspired. Knowing very little about South Africa's past, he had to lot to read up on. "This film goes to the heart of every aspect of South African history over the last 60 years and in that sense it was a very big lesson - a PhD in South African history," he says. Making his research a little easier, Fabian was able to sell the publication rights of Sandra's story to Miramax Books. The company hired Judith Stone to write Sandra's biography and she generously shared her findings with Fabian. Laing was also an active consultant on the film. "I think she found it very cathartic and quite therapeutic to see the scenes from her life being acted out and certainly the process of sharing her story with the world has been a very healing one for her," he says. The process of getting the film noticed has been a slow burn though. "Casting was tricky because there are very few black actresses that mean something to financiers and distributors," he recalls. Assuming that it'd be an easier task, Fabian decided to cast the parents first. While there were plenty of name actors to choose from, there were few that were willing to play supporting roles to an unknown African actress in a low budget, independent film. For the role of Sandra, therefore, Fabian needed a name that meant something in the industry. He noticed the UK actress Okonedo, who had been nominated for an Oscar for her part in Hotel Rwanda. Fabian approached her and she committed to the film within weeks of reading the script.The script itself took five years to perfect. For Fabian, the central narrative was about dynamic between Sandra and her parents - the issue of racial discrimination was just a backdrop. "The thing that makes the film most universal is that fact that we all have parents and I think that that cycle of rejection-acceptance that Sandra goes through is something that many of us go through with our families," he explains. Nonetheless, the touchy topic of racism made the film difficult to find distribution for. "A racist subject matter is considered something of a taboo and difficult for people - it takes films like Samson and Delilah to actually break through and prove that there are audiences that are wiling to deal with difficult subjects; subjects that involve non-white people," says Fabian. Fabian persevered and proved the cynics wrong - Skin was one of most popular films during the Perth Film Festival and is now due to open in at least eight Australian cities. It has now won 18 international awards and opened up many doors for the American-born Fabian, who started out as an opera director before moving on to short films and documentaries. "I'm not going to just make films with a message - not just for it to be medicine that's good for you. I want it to be in some way engaging as well," he says. Emily Cheng]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An Australian couple arrives at Calcutta Airport at dawn. Fiona (Radha Mitchell) is a high-flying lawyer; Ben (Joel Edgerton) is a music producer. They're in India to adopt a child, but the process stalls and they're forced to wait in the city for days - obliging them to confront relationship issues that have long lain buried. The debut feature of Sydney director Claire McCarthy, The Waiting City is the first Australian film to be shot entirely in India. It draws upon the director's personal experiences working in Bengali orphanages with her younger sister, Helena. "She believes I owe the whole movie to her," McCarthy laughs. "She was going through a war of attrition with my mum in her last year of high school. Mum said, ‘I cook for you, I clean for you and you're so ungrateful. You'd never survive a day in the slums of Calcutta.' My sister said, ‘yes I would.' My sister rang me and said, ‘Mum's gonna make me go to Calcutta, do you wanna come?'"They arrived in the city in 2002, the elder McCarthy girl bringing a camera to record what they saw, together with her sister's emotional meltdown. "We travelled through the streets and saw bodies sleeping - [Helena] wasn't certain if they were alive or dead. We couldn't find a hotel. She thought she had arrived on the set of a horror film." They eventually settled in and did volunteer work with Mother Teresa's sisters. McCarthy met foreign couples who had travelled to India to collect their adoptive children."The adoption process is not easy," she says. "It's protracted, it's expensive, it's difficult. I do feel the emotional impact that it has on people can really galvanise their relationship or tear them apart."McCarthy, a graduate of the AFTRS, went on to make the documentary Sisters in Calcutta. While shooting the Old Man River music video ‘Sunshine' on the banks of the Ganges, McCarthy revealed to a crew member her idea for a feature film together with her dream star - Radha Mitchell. The story found its way into the Times of India and caught the attention of Mitchell herself, who signed on after reading McCarthy's script.   Casting the role of former rock star Ben was trickier. "Ben had to be a bit of a boy man - not a man's man, but to grow into that through the course of the movie. I always had an eye on Joel and the clincher was when he performed U2's ‘With or Without You' to show that he could sing." The production utilised many of Bollywood's brightest acting and filmmaking talents but perhaps the real star of the movie is Sydney cinematographer Denson Baker. Every frame of The Waiting City is ravishing. "Denson was the year above me at film school so we worked on a few things together. We filmed [The Waiting City] for four months in India and then we decided if we could get through a shoot like that we could get through anything. He's now my husband." But are they going to adopt an Indian child? "We're thinking about it!" Nick Dent

      <review><![CDATA[Don’t expect anything too radical from this infuriatingly soft yet still pleasantly subdued and poignant screen adaptation of Randal Keynes’s book ‘Annie’s Box’, about the emotional traumas suffered by Charles Darwin (Paul Bettany) as he forms the ideas destined for the pages of his magnum opus, ‘On the Origin of Species’. Director Jon Amiel and screenwriter John Collee have gone out of their way not to antagonise either side of the science/religion debate, instead offering a distinctive take on evolutionary theory as refracted through Darwin’s relations with his pious wife (a sour-faced Jennifer Connelly, offering an occasionally hilarious, literal approximation of the Queen’s English) and increasingly curious brood.

In effect reprising his role from Peter Weir’s 2003 swashbuckler Master and Commander, the ever-reliable Bettany plays Darwin as a kindly fusspot who discovers that his austere view of death as an essential cog in the machinery of natural selection has the potential to outrage those who find consolation in an afterlife of clouds, angels and spiritual exoneration. This becomes all the more relevant when his own daughter Annie (likeable newcomer Martha West) is brought down with scarlet fever and he is forced to face the harrowing corollaries of his own theory. With its bijou period trappings and Enya-lite score, it’s easy to dismiss the film as another pat, issue-ducking weepie, but on closer inspection it offers interesting and cohesive musings on the illogical nature of the human character, and how that fits with the responsibilities of scientific discovery. As the title suggests, it’s a film more interested in the birth and nurturing of ideas and their relationship to society than it is in extracting a crude drama from Darwin nervously pressing a knife to God’s throat. In that sense, it succeeds admirably. David Jenkins]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Dream sequences within movies are all too common, and
actually kind of naff. But how do you like dreams-within-dreams - or
dreams-within-dreams-within-dreams? The human mind is a terrifying labyrinth,
or at least Christopher Nolan's is, and the British-born filmmaker has followed
up his gloomy and over-praised Dark Knight with something truly astonishing: a cerebral thriller that asks its audience to
keep track of heart-racing action taking place on four planes of reality,
simultaneously.  Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) works in ‘extractions', stealing
secrets from corporate giants by appearing to them in their slumber. When Saito
(Ken Watanabe) employs Cobb to go the opposite tack and implant a disastrous
business idea in the mind of a rival (Cillian Murphy), the game's afoot and
Cobb assembles a crack team of experts (including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen
Page and Bronson's Tom Hardy) to pull
off the dreamland caper. What they don't count on is a malevolent figure from
Cobb's unconscious (Marion Cotillard) turning up and pulling the rug from under
their illusions.  Nolan has at last made a worthy successor to his mindbending
Memento - a rip-roaring actioner that piles
intellectual conceit upon intellectual conceit, yet remains remarkably lucid
and straightforward. The multiple dreamscapes he brings to the screen include
gasp-inducing CGI images, such as a city giving birth to its mirror twin. But
even more uncanny is his use of real-world tricks like a fist-fight that takes
place in a zero-gravity hotel corridor.  Nolan wields film narrative like a Mozart, a Descartes, or
at least the smartest kid in the chess club. Inception may be two and half hours of car chases, gun fights
and intrigue but, like Memento,
it's also an inquiry into what we really know about life and what it truly
means to ‘wake up'. Ladies and gents, the Oscar race has officially started and
Inception is the one to beat. Nick

      <review><![CDATA[Miranda Otto has brought her star quality to movies including The Lord of the Rings, War of the Worlds, Human Nature and Danny Deckchair. But on the set of her latest and arguably best film, South Solitary, it was a scene-stealing lamb that attracted the most admirers. "Little Bill was the pinup of the shoot," Otto recalls with a laugh. "Everyone was in love with him. In the makeup trailer there were photos of him everywhere."The sight of Otto clutching her woolly co-star opens Shirley Barrett's new movie. It's 1927 and Otto, as Meredith Appleton, a 35-year-old spinster, is accompaniying her lighthouse keeper uncle Wadsworth (played by her father, Barry Otto) to a posting on a remote Southern Ocean island. Wadsworth is appalled by the lack of discipline on the island and sets about making changes. The previous head keeper has shot himself and the lighthouse has since been run by two assistant keepers: George Stanley (Rohan Nichol) and Jack Fleet (Marton Csokas). Fleet is a shellshocked war veteran and keeps to himself. Stanley is married with three children but immediately starts flirting with Meredith. "At the time many of the young men had died at war so there were a lot of women left on their own," Otto explains. "My character is probably thinking that she will most likely never get married. She's someone who's starved of affection; she lost her mother young and got stuck with an uncle who's very strict. And she can have her head turned very easily by a kind word from any gentleman."Barrett wrote the part with Otto in mind, having cast her once before in her debut feature, Love Serenade (1996). A magic realist comedy of two small-town sisters competing for the affections of an oily DJ, Love Serenade won the Camera D'Or in Cannes that year and gave Otto's acting career the boost it needed at the time. "I felt I'd been pigeonholed in things I didn't really like and I was thinking, ‘Do I really want to do acting?' Then I got Love Serenade and it was such a great character it made people look at me differently."For South Solitary, Otto and Barrett collaborated on fleshing out the main character's backstory, combing the Mitchell Library for 1927 photographs and newspapers. "It was wonderful reading the help columns for things like dry hands. We take for granted washing machines these days and forget how much life was a struggle for people. We also started writing letters to each other. Shirley said, ‘I'll pretend to be Meredith's friend, Myra,' and wrote me these hilarious letters and posted them and I'd write back." Otto's stock rose considerably after she played the heroic Eowyn in two Lord of the Rings movies and three years ago she was cast as the lead in a Sex and the City/Desperate Housewives hybrid called Cashmere Mafia. Then the Hollywood writers' strike came down and the show was cancelled after only seven episodes. "I would have loved to have done it a bit longer," she says. "It was a pleasure to work on stories about women and I miss the fact there isn't anything like that on television any more."In 2005 she had a daughter, Darcey, with husband Peter O'Brien, and has focused on making films in Australia including Blessed and In Her Skin. Otto has never won an AFI award, but that's a situation that South Solitary should remedy. Not only does she get some heart-rending scenes, it's a showcase for her skill at understated comedy. Otto, however, is quick to channel praise to the film's writer-director. "Shirley's writing is so funny and she has an original viewpoint on things. Just when you think things are about to get sentimental she'll have something really odd and funny happen." Nick Dent]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Last year, Amy Adams whined her way through Julie &amp; Julia as a modern-day food blogger, when all we really hungered for was more of Meryl Streep’s magically right Julia Child. So take the title of Me and Orson Welles as a slight warning. Yes, the Citizen Kane director figures prominently - and gloriously - in this 1937-set theatrical backstage drama. But in the spotlight, there’s a blandly eager high-schooler (Efron, unable to penetrate the cute), who’s conscripted into the zesty goings-on. Would someone please drag him offstage already? There’s a rising star in the wings.
Britain’s Christian McKay has already played Welles to great acclaim Off Broadway; his impersonation here is nothing short of astounding. Just to be totally clear, this is not the sprawling Mount Orson of the director’s latter years (or even of Touch of Evil). It’s the young phenom who terrorized the radio waves, tore around Manhattan in an ambulance and chased skirt on his way to Shakespearean glory. McKay effortlessly captures the man’s arrogance, sparring with tireless producer John Houseman (Happy-Go-Lucky’s fuming Marsan), but he’s even better with Welles’s sly invitation of a wink, drawing all to his bidding, happily. The voice is uncanny too.
Me and Orson Welles preoccupies itself with some romantic tussles - nice enough, but nothing on McKay’s dynamic moments of ego. Maybe this is a good time to mention that the director is Richard Linklater, usually a lot more versatile. Try to imagine a version of Linklater’s School of Rock that didn’t pivot on the manic music teacher played by Jack Black but instead, perhaps, on his boring roommate. That’s what you have here. Had Welles been in charge, there’d be no contest.  Joshua Rothkopf
Preview:Orson Welles's revolutionary 1937 stage adaptation of Julius Caesar famously relocated Shakespeare's play to a fascist context. Of course,
while it was in rehearsals, no one would have known how influential the
production would become.Enter director Richard Linklater's Me and Orson Welles.
Adapted from a novel by Robert Kaplow, the film views the playmaking
process through the eyes of a fictitious bit player, Richard (Zac
Efron), who has brushes with love (with Claire Danes) and genius (in
the form of Welles, played by uncanny newcomer Christian McKay) as the
show comes together. The way Linklater sees it, the movie shouldn't be
seen as just Richard's coming-of-age story. "I also consider it a
Welles coming-of-age movie, because he's only 22," the director
explains. "This is his first Mercury Theatre production. Although he's
had plenty of success already at his young age, he really is still
discovering who he is, who he's going to be, who he wants to be."The
Welles brand may be as much a hindrance as a help. When the film
premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival, a colleague
speculated that distributors wouldn't touch it because of the "curse of
Orson Welles." (The filmmaking polymath had more than his share of
butchered Hollywood projects.) It will have been almost two years between the Toronto world premiere and the day Me and Orson Welles finally sees Australian theaters, but Linklater says the delay had less to do with
skittishness surrounding the Welles mystique than the fact that the
film wasn't quite completed when it first played. At Toronto, it was
projected digitally without a final sound mix, so between finishing the
movie and getting it picked up for distribution, "it might have taken
that year anyway," Linklater says. Plus, he adds, "[Any Welles] curse
probably just existed during his lifetime - I think Orson only grows with
each generation."Let's hope that's true, because Me and Orson Welles is a grand backstage crowd-pleaser that, as Linklater suggested when he
introduced the first Toronto screening, celebrates the joy of theatre.
It's also, more subtly, a movie about hindsight and regret."A
lot of those guys who worked with Welles then - I think as even Norman
Lloyd [who played Cinna the poet in Welles's production] said - didn't
totally appreciate that at the time," Linklater says. "[He assumed]
there [would] always be a guy like Orson Welles [to work for]... At 23,
he didn't really appreciate what was happening right in front of him."A
major part of the challenge, of course, was casting a convincing
Welles, and Linklater found one in McKay, a British actor who'd starred
in his own one-man Welles show. "The magic of Christian was that he's
an unknown," Linklater says. "You're not going, ‘Leonardo DiCaprio's
doing a pretty good Welles.'"The Welles of 1937 was Welles before Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, Touch of Evil and Chimes at Midnight - and even before his landmark radio-play version of War of the Worlds.
"There might be [a possibility for] another movie about Welles's time at the Gate Theatre in Dublin or something, but this
seems to be the earliest depiction of him," Linklater says. "We all
know what comes soon after and much later, and everyone has their own
theories, opinions and all that, but it was just kind of fun to deal
with young Mr Welles."The focus on the collaborative process of
Welles's early years returns Linklater to the theme of one of his most
popular films. "In School of Rock,
I wanted to show how fun it might look to be in a band," Linklater
says. "What I liked in both these movies is that it was really about
the process - being part of an artistic troupe... That's what films are.
They're constantly in the state of becoming until the very end." Ben Kenigsberg]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This pseudo-documentary by Harmony Korine (Gummo) follows a group of horny geriatrics as they lurk through the streets of suburbia. A cross between horror and comedy, it’s undoubtedly unconventional. As the name suggests, it’s about people humping trash. The gang thrust themselves onto trashcans, walls, and give blowjobs to tree branches. The characters are spontaneous and delusional – they cackle, grunt, scream, and sing haunting lullabies. They smash abandoned houses with axes, force strangers to entertain them, and roam the streets with flashlights. Their wrinkly, heavily made-up faces are nightmarish. In one of many disturbing scenes the group gathers around a basketball court singing to a baby doll wrapped in a plastic bag. One sits a chubby boy on her lap and teaches him to insert a razor blade into an apple. Then they sit around the creepy boy as he horrifyingly describes the process for suffocating a doll. And then they’re humping trashcans again. Like a scary home video, Trash Humpers boasts no script and no storyline. Scenes are roughly cut and edited in an enigmatic manner. It doesn’t make much sense, but it certainly makes you wonder what the moral of the story is – if one exists.Viewers unfamiliar with Korine’s alternative style of filmmaking may walk out in disgust. But if you’re willing to broaden your cinematic expectations to include the utterly random, it’s a must-see. Emily ChengFactory Theatre, Marrickville, Fri 10 Sep, 7.45pm; Sat 11 Sep, 2pm.]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[The Ghost Writer]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[We’re so used to amped-up white-knucklers that the controlled approach of a filmmaker like Roman Polanski is immediately seductive. The director responsible for such mainstays as Chinatown and Rosemary’s Baby (and of course his own real-life news cycle) turns Robert Harris’s political potboiler involving a ghostwriter (McGregor), a former British prime minister (Brosnan) and an isolated island home into a slow-burn near-masterpiece. Shot in claustrophobic widescreen, the film showcases Polanski’s mastery of even expository scenes: A revealing conversation between McGregor’s so-called ghost and a shady figure played by Tom Wilkinson is so fraught with tension that you expect those malevolent Cocteau-esque hands from Repulsion to burst out of the wall and drag someone into oblivion.
The film stays more grounded than that, though it certainly doesn’t lack for perverse Polanski flourishes. There’s a great bit of carnal business with the prime minister’s wife (Williams) that’s filmed in a deadpan long shot. Eli Wallach pops up—frail-looking though spirited—as an old-timer who stokes the writer’s paranoia about his employer’s plans for him. And more than one character has a wry aside on the protagonist’s heritage (“Oh, you Brits!”), as if it was both a badge of honor and a reason for condescending suspicion.
There are all number of similarly colorful touches (the sick-joke ending alone is worth the price of admission) that help to deepen what one colleague suggested is the greatest airport novel ever filmed. It’s true that The Ghost Writer doesn’t possess the lingering profundity of the director’s best work—the War on Terror window dressing is just that. Yet Polanski has made a genre piece with a verve and vitality that’s in sadly short supply. Keith Uhlich]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The first thing that springs to mind when viewing Scott Pilgrim vs The World is that
director Edgar Wright is a genius. Never before has a comic book been so
gracefully transferred to the big screen than in his latest effort, based on
the series of graphic novels by Bryan Lee O'Malley. The title character is a hipster
heartbreaker who meets the girl of his dreams and in order to be with her  must defeat her seven evil exes in combat. Even if you aren't familiar
with the source material, the movie lays everything out quickly and you never
feel like you are missing out on anything.Wright's success on this film comes from meeting his stylistic references on their
own territory: onomatopoeic words accompany sound effects just like in comic
books; videogame powerups float around in 8-bit glory; and martial arts battles
climax in eye-shattering visuals reminiscent of anime. Clever direction and
editing give the movie the feel of actually reading the comics themselves, with
scenes flowing and blending like comic panels and great physical comedy adding
a hint of classic cartoons to the mix. The casting is flawless. As Scott, Michael
Cera finally gets to showcase a wider range of talent than his usual ‘simpering
teen' role. He is excellent, not only capturing the humourous, vunerable side of
his character, but also playing a mightily convincing hero. Mary Elizabeth
Winstead is both charming and mysterious as Scott's object of desire, and Jason
Schwartzman gleefully chomps the scenery as the main villain Gideon. Special
mentions have to go to Kieran Culkin as Scott's wry, gay roommate Wallace and Aubrey Plaza
as the foul-mouthed social busybody Julie Powers. With a tight, hilarious script, excellent special effects, brilliant cultural references and a story that marries romance and action perfectly, Scott Pilgrim is
potentially the most fun movie to come out this year – a kinetic epic that both
stands for and gently lampoons the generation it came from. Superheroes should be so lucky to get this treatment. Jonathon Valenzuela]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When you take away a man's job you take away his pride. Take
away a man's job but force him to show up to work anyway, and you have a recipe
for disaster. New Oz flick The Nothing Men explores what happens when six
workers who are soon to be made redundant have to wait out weeks with nothing
to do on an empty factory floor. Their anxious wait is inflamed when a worker from a
different factory, David (David Field), is transferred to theirs. Foreman Jack
(Colin Friels) suspects the interloper is a spy for the parent company. If
workers break the rules or leave the factory during work hours they can be
dismissed and lose their redundancy cheques. Jack and his coworkers have been spending the time drinking
beer and playing poker, both of which are against regulations, so they're
considerably resentful of the new guy, who's irritatingly polite into the
bargain.  The only worker who likes him is Wesley (Martin Dingle-Wall),
who engages David in games of chess, but whose murky past contains a secret
that will bring about a devastating series of events. The Nothing Men is the debut feature of Mark Fitzpatrick and
based on his play of the same name. It's now showing at Hoyts Broadway and Randwick Ritz (for one week only).]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Marisa (Jacinda Barrett) is having a lousy week. No sooner is her young son Jack (Tom Russell) diagnosed with leukemia than she discovers that her husband (Richard Roxburgh) is a serial philanderer. While Jack befriends another leukemia sufferer (Kodi Smit-McPhee) Marisa becomes close to his Irish father (James Nesbitt). Matching Jack is a romantic tearjerker about illness, infidelity and silver linings. Veteran Aussie director Nadia Tass explains the making of her first local film (with partner David Parker) in 13 years.What was the inspiration for this film?This was inspired by a number of true stories. Lynne Renew wrote the original script and it was just a very strong, emotional story. The idea that a child's life might be saved through his father's infidelity was just so original and so loaded that we were immediately pretty keen on doing it.Getting the tone of this film right must have been difficult? When we first read the script ten years ago, tonally it was different. We added more humour. I think David and I are pretty much known for taking serious subject matter and couching it in humour.  Jacinda Barrett is an Australian actress but this is her first Australian film...I had Jacinda on my radar from a long time ago. The audience is actually going to believe that Jacinda Barrett is actually Marisa Hagen, because even though Jacinda has been in Bridget Jones's Diary and Ladder 49 and The Last Kiss and all of that, she actually isn't a recognisable face to that degree that it's going to colour their perception of the character. What made you choose Kodi Smit-McPhee, James Nesbitt and Richard Roxburgh? It was about three years before we shot it that we started talking to Kodi and Kodi's father. I had to have Kodi play Finn. He's such a wonderful actor. And Jimmy [Nesbitt] read the script five years before we shot it and said yes right away and stuck with us through all the vagaries of the financing process. I was thrilled that he wanted to come on board. Richard [Roxburgh] was kind of late into it. It was actually a really rough role to cast because he begins as the bad guy and we needed to make that character very human and not just see him of a caricature of the all bad guys out there who were screwing around. I didn't want to go there and neither did Richard.Is it true you re-mortgaged your house to help finance it?Yeah that's true! It's more than a decade since you've made a film in Australia, right?Yeah and I really wanted to come home. I felt this film would sit so much better in Melbourne. We did talk about Seattle.  You've made a couple of TV films with Julia Roberts' production company in the States. How did that come about?She approached us. She saw Amy (1997). That's flattering.Yeah, it was good, because it meant we did the first two for her and that was setting the tone for the subsequent films that were going to be made and it's good. There's been constant work in America for us. Gaynor Flynn]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Recent news about unmasked Russian sleeper agents in New York City might have lent the new paranoid action thriller Salt a kind of currency, but this story of nasty
Russians trying to start a global war is a mouldy slice of Reagan-era baloney.
Angelina Jolie is Evelyn Salt, a CIA operative on the run
after being fingered by a defecting Russian agent as one of their own. Is she
an innocent fugitive or an enemy of the state? Her CIA colleagues (Liev
Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor) can't decide, but as Salt escapes from one
hopeless situation after another it becomes clear that she's on her way to a
funeral to be attended by both the US and Russian presidents - and she's armed to the
teeth. Australia's Phillip Noyce directs Kurt Wimmer's script, which rockets along with chase
sequences and confounds with double-crosses but can't hide its essentially
facile nature. As for Jolie, she spends the film wearing an
I'm-pretty-and-I've-got-a-secret smirk that would mark her out as suspicious in a
crowd of thousands. To her credit, though, she gamely leaps off trucks, slams into walls and jumps out of a choppers. She – and a couple of dozen female stunt doubles – must be nursing a lot of bruises. Nick

      <review><![CDATA[Ahead of its Sydney premiere, we caught up with Kayvan Novak, one of the stars of Chris Morris's controversial comedy about four hapless jihadis.Welcome to Sydney. Have you been seeing the sights? We took a boat to Watsons Bay. We went on a walk
past the male nudist beach, to the lighthouse and back again.
  Interesting choice. Were there any male nudists there? Oh, there were – there was a congregation on one
side of five nude males. I think they had been camping. Not like that.
Actually, yes – like that. But they also had a tent.   In other news, how did you get involved with Four
Lions? The usual. Agent:
"Do you want to meet [co-writer/director] Chris Morris? He's doing a film about suicide bombers."
"Yes please!" Met him in a café, had a chat, he gave me some DVDs of
Asian lads from the north of England and said: "Look at this guy in particular. Give me the accent." I
gave him an accent. He was like, "Try harder." I got the part over the course
of a year. When you first read the Four Lions script and realised it was a comedy about jihadi
suicide bombers, what did you think? I thought: "I've got so many
lines. Wicked! This is awesome." No, I did think seriously about it. I don't think I would have done it with anyone else apart from Chris.
It's really about trusting him and trusting that he knew what he was doing. And
he did.
Did you worry about how certain people might react if
they thought you were mocking Islamic fundamentalists? Did you
think you might have had to go into hiding? Yeah,
there was a lot of that at the beginning where people would initially go: "Hmm:
suicide bombers. Comedy. What's funny about that?" It's a film ultimately. It's
trying to break that fear factor down really, by extracting humour from a
potentially humourless subject. The film will surprise a few people with just how far it
pushes the envelope... That's the beauty of the film – it kind of tickles you and
then kicks you in the balls at a certain point. And then kicks you again,
harder. That reaction is quite common, where people find it really funny, but
also really moving. Several times the film makes you laugh out loud, but then a couple
of seconds later you get laugher's remorse where you suddenly realise what
you're laughing at. Presumably that kind of discomfort is entirely deliberate? Yeah, not many films take you
there. That's the skill of Chris really. Dan Rookwood]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[The Killer Inside Me]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[It’s 1959, West Texas: the sun is beating down and the sheriff’s deputy, Lou Ford (Casey Affleck), is padding the quiet, widescreen streets of smalltown Central City like a model law enforcer, courteous and polite to the passing citizenry and neat in his blouson, tie and – the Southerner’s sacred badge of down-home decency – kidskin boots and wide-brim Stetson. But, he’s walking through Jim Thompson country – the dissembling, rotten home ground of the nihilistic pulp novelist from whose shocking 1952 novel Michael Winterbottom has fashioned his first American movie – and nothing is as it first appears.

The sarcastic faux banalities Lou offers people he meets, for his own light amusement, may betray a more complicated mind than the handsome young detective likes to make plain. He’s also shouldering a tragic past involving a lost brother-in-law which in-the-know locals (including union man Elias Koteas), the city fathers (including Ned Beatty), his secret long-term girlfriend Amy (Kate Hudson) and fellow police colleagues (including Tom Bower’s sheriff) happily connive in keeping buried. But few realise that the man is a walking timebomb. However, the day soon comes when he’s sent to chase off a local prostitute, the beautiful and fiery Joyce (Jessica Alba), and receives the slap that is to trigger in him an explosion of unexpected passion, intricate deceit and murderous self-destruction…

The film arrives on screens heralded by some box-office-boosting bad publicity, with shockwaves emanating from some who have witnessed the film’s face-pulverising, hard-to-stomach bouts of violence. Yet this again-atypical film from Winterbottom, the genre-swapping director of A Mighty Heart, Genova and The Road to Guantanamo, is a much more sober affair than its early, controversial press might suggest.

Faithful – awfully – to Thompson’s devil’s-résumé-style source text and despairing worldview, it also occupies an emotional space of unnerving calm. The unfussy, if lazily expressive, cinematography (by Winterbottom regular Marcel Zyskind) of familiar ’50s Americana, the unobtrusive set design of jail, courthouse and Texan home, and the relaxed, cowpoke-paced editing are all in concert with it. Together they produce a dirge-like accompaniment to a hypnotic and remarkable central performance by Affleck.

With his other Ford (movie-stealing coward Robert in Andrew Dominik’s retro-western The Assassination of Jesse James…) and his terrific turn as the Boston cop in his older brother’s underrated Gone Baby Gone, the younger Affleck is arguably becoming the most compulsively watchable American actor of his generation. He’s capable of saving a pretentious film (The Assassination…), giving a spine to a potentially diffuse one (Gone Baby Gone) and, as here, giving a sense of mystery and plaintive spirituality to a movie that would otherwise seem underpowered and uncertain of its own moral purpose or profundity. There are other good performances to enjoy – notably from Koteas and Alba – but it’s Affleck who justifies the price of your ticket. Wally Hammond]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[There's something appropriate about the timing of French writer-director Mia Hansen-Løve's sublime second film, Father of My Children, which arrives on the 50th anniversary of Hitchcock's Psycho. In story, the films couldn't be further apart: Hansen-Løve's follows a maverick French film producer in modern day Paris and his precarious attempts to juggle work and family life, while Hitchcock's is a tale of insanity in smalltown America. Yet both adopt a similar, audacious two-part structure that mischievously tugs the rug from beneath our feet at roughly the mid-point and asks us to reassess completely our relationships to the characters on screen.Hansen-Løve only partially agrees with this theory: "I wanted to show the death of a film production company," she says. "If you take the company as the main protagonist, the story becomes neat and chronological."She pulled off the same dual-tier trick with her 2007 debut, Tout Est Pardonné (‘All Is Forgiven'), in which a mother and daughter are forced to adapt to some of the father's more anti-social whims. "I see my two films as complementary to one other," she says. "The themes of mourning, reconstruction and the love between a mother and daughter are in both."Father of My Children has been lauded for its insightful and candid depiction of the film industry, drawing positive comparisons to Altman's The Player and Truffaut's Day for Night. What makes Father of My Children so refreshing and interesting is that it feels like a visual extension of Hansen-Løve's preoccupations. Her precise understanding of middle-class mores, her constant nods to the world of independent cinema (there's a character in the film who could be a conflation of any number of maverick directors) and her love of young actors suggest a sensitive and inquisitive mind at work. "What drew me to cinema is that mix of the artistic and the spiritual," she says, "but I also like dealing pragmatically with the real world, with real things."She admits that she only became a film lover relatively late in life. ‘When I was 16, I was studying drama and I was cast in two films by [current beau and father of her child] Olivier Assayas: Late August, Early September and Les Destinées Sentimentales. That's when it all started for me."The Assayas connection goes further than those two films and the romance. In its representation of the workings of the film industry, Father of My Children feels very much like an update of Irma Vep, Assayas's witty 1996 chronicle of the filmmaking process. But are we supposed to read the liquidation of a boutique production company as a broader critique on the European film industry where smaller, more leftfield companies are being subsumed and asset-stripped by larger ones?"In a sense yes, you can see it like that. But at the same time I wanted to make a very specific film about a very specific situation, about a very specific company and about a very specific person. So it's got both. There are people who have nothing to do with cinema who come up to me at the end of screenings and say to me, ‘This is my story!'"Next she plans to make a film dealing with teenagers, again in a bourgeois setting. "Without wanting to make too many comparisons to Eric Rohmer, people always said to him, ‘Why do you always make films about young women?' And he would always reply, ‘I only speak about what I know.' I feel exactly the same way." David Jenkins]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Budding landscaper Jules (Moore) and determined career gal Nic (Bening) are a Los Angeles lesbian couple with two teenage kids—daughter Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and son Laser (Josh Hutcherson)—who they conceived through a sperm bank. The donor for both is organic restaurateur Paul (Ruffalo), a sleepy-eyed semi-fuck-up whom 18-year-old Joni contacts out of curiosity. The kids hit it off with their sorta-father, but the “Moms” (as they call them) want to grill the guy before things get too familial. One awkward dinner later, Jules has promised to redecorate Paul’s backyard with some flora, while Nic maintains her skeptical stance. And for good reason…Lisa Cholodenko’s self-consciously low-key drama—a hit on the festival circuit—never quite shakes its sitcom-ish setup. The director alternates incident-laden storytelling with penetrating character moments that her terrific cast acts to the fullest. The sheer joy of watching Bening and Moore do dyke, with barely a hint of straight-playing-gay self-congratulation, mitigates many of the film’s missteps. These great actors can lend depth to most anything, even a contrived hidden-porn gag. Ruffalo is every bit their equal, especially when he’s being bad. The smile he cracks after he beds someone he shouldn’t is revelatory: Infidelity may be wrong, but in the moment it’s hella fun. Yet there’s something suspect in the way the film disposes of him, as if his very real complications (the paternal love he shows alongside his libidinous flaws) have no place in the unconvincingly traditionalist family portrait Cholodenko is painting. Moore’s “marriage is hard” climactic speech is particularly unfortunate—an Oscar clip trying desperately to mask its award-grubbiness, the kind of faux-profound summation that would make Aesop cringe.

      <review><![CDATA[For many Australians who grew up in the 1990s, one series of novels encapsulates all the anger, euphoria and just-leave-me-alone of adolescence: John Marsden’s Tomorrow series. In book one, Tomorrow, When the War Began, seven teens return from a camping trip to find their small country town occupied by enemy forces. Cut off from their parents and hunted by foreign troops, they’re forced to fight for their lives and wage a daring guerrilla war for survival.“Its very empowering for teenagers,” explains Stuart Beattie, the Australian-born Hollywood screenwriter who makes his directorial debut with the book’s film adaptation. “It kind of says, the kids are all right; you can do this and you can step up. Every teenager wants to get away from their parents and be able to run around and blow stuff up and have it be legitimate.”The books have been hotly pursued for the film rights since publication but Marsden, whose day job is as a school principal in Victoria, has fought off all comers until now. Beattie certainly brings strong credentials to the job. He has scripted major Hollywood hits including the first Pirates of the Caribbean, Collateral, 3:10 to Yuma and GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra. Marsden was so impressed with Beattie’s script that he offered only a tiny number of notes. “He was wonderfully, respectfully hands-off,” Beattie says.Set in the fictional town of Wirrawee, the film stars former Neighbours actress Caitlin Stasey as Ellie Linton, who together with best friend Corrie (Rachel Hurd-Wood) masterminds a camping trip with five other school friends: Corrie’s boyfriend Kevin (Lincoln Lewis), a boy Ellie likes called Lee (Christopher Pang), lovable lout Homer (Deniz Akdeniz), spoilt Fiona (Phoebe Tonkin), and mousy Robyn (Ashleigh Cummings).They return a week later to find their parents’ farms deserted and the Wirrawee Showground converted into a concentration camp. While the nationality of the invading country is never specified in the books, Beattie cast Asian actors as the enemy soldiers. “It seemed the logical thing, being so close to Asia, but I didn’t want to get into who specifically. It’s popular entertainment, it’s not a political statement.”The film was shot last year in Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Hunter Valley. To get his cast to bond Beattie took them for a day’s paintballing. “If you play paintball you get really excited and scared and you have to rely on each other. I also took them to climb the Harbour Bridge. It’s about having adventures together.”Beattie, 38, was born in Melbourne and grew up in the Sydney north shore suburb of Warrawee – “from Warrawee to Wirrawee, would you believe.” Almost from his first childhood viewing of Star Wars he wanted to be a filmmaker and decided that screenwriting was his way in. After completing a broadcast journalism degree at Charles Sturt University he attended screenwriting classes at UCLA, where he won an award that got his career started.“I always wanted my first film to be an Australian film,” he says. “It was a matter of waiting till I felt ready to direct and finding the right material. I had been offered a couple [of Hollywood directing jobs] but they were crappy genre films and you invest so much of yourself that you’ve got to love the project.”Beattie has worked with some of the biggest directors in Hollywood and on signing on for Tomorrow he called them all, asking for their directing dos and don’ts. “Wolfgang Petersen said ‘You must serve soup! Every day at 11 everyone on the set will start to get angry, so bring out soup and everyone’s happy.’ So I had soup every day on the set. It’s about caring for the people who help you to realise this vision.” There are seven books in the Tomorrow series: can we look forward to Beattie writing and directing the sequels? “I would love to. We had so much fun making this. It’s up to the audience. If they come in enough numbers then we would be there in a heartbeat. Nick Dent]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[What if supervillains lived among us? That’s the question posed by this fitfully amusing animated feature, which follows a hulking, Lugosi-accented baddie named Gru (Carell) as he tries to steal the moon. (Yes, the actual moon.) Gru’s the kind of guy who’ll make a balloon animal to soothe a crying child—and then pop it. But his malicious genius is barely in demand, thanks to hot young turk Vector (Segel), who’s stolen the Great Pyramid of Giza and hidden it in his backyard. Vector also has a shrink ray that Gru needs to pinch so he can get a scheme-funding loan from the Bank of Evil (“formerly Lehman Brothers”—the film’s best joke). What better way to make his nemesis lower his guard than with a doe-eyed trio of cookie-selling orphans? The setup is pure Looney Tunes, and indeed, Despicable Me is at its best when trading in the anything-for-a-laugh prankery that was a specialty of the Termite Terrace crowd. Gru’s yellow, gibberish-spouting minions are the most reliable chuckle-generators: One of them is the subject of a glow-stick gag that should make even the grumpiest audience member LOL. And there are some terrific throwaway rib-ticklers, such as Vector’s hilariously useless “piranha gun” and the Bank of Evil’s crush-the-little-man decor. But sentiment soon overwhelms the subversiveness, as Gru learns that being a responsible family guy is preferable to world domination. The more the character loses his antisocial edge, the more he becomes a Disneyfied dullard. Still, let’s see Aladdin get down to the Bee Gees. Keith Uhlich]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Young British screenwriter J Blakeson, co-writer of The Descent: Part Two and the director of two well-regarded shorts, shoots his own script for his feature debut and comes up with an intense, surprising three-hander about a kidnapping. There are hints of Sleuth in this low-budget affair: the claustrophobic energy, the small cast, the wordplay, the single location and the power games driven by sex and sexuality. The set-up is simple: two men, one ruthless with a hair-trigger temper (Eddie Marsan), one more submissive (Martin Compston), kidnap Alice (Gemma Arterton), the daughter of a businessman, lock her in a derelict flat and threaten to kill her unless a ransom is paid. Bar an early, effective montage of the kidnappers’ preparations and the film’s bloody close, the story unfolds in Alice’s grotty, makeshift cell and concerns itself with the shifting relationships and loyalties of its three protagonists.Some might feel we’re in titillating FHM territory at the sight of Bond girl Arterton tied to a bed and writhing around in her underwear, but all hints of exploitation are thankfully just that. The superior acting from Arterton, Marsan and Compston, combined with Blakeson’s resourceful and focused direction, force through a sometimes awkward plot and rescue the film from a middle section that looks to be heading for a brick wall. The success of the film is in the detail: we watch as hostage and kidnapper negotiate the difficulties of a captive going to the toilet and feel the tension as a bullet refuses to travel round the U-bend. Arterton gives it her all, while Marsan mines a seam of rage familiar from Happy-Go-Lucky. Dave Calhoun]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA["I’m the guy who does his job," goes Mark Wahlberg’s oft-quoted insult from 2006’s The Departed. “You must be the other guy!” So it’s a nice twist of cinematic fate that, in Adam McKay’s gonzo goof on buddy-cop flicks, the actor finds himself on the flip side of that bon mot. His hot-tempered NYC officer, Terry Hoitz, has been busted down to desk duty after an embarrassing incident involving a discharged weapon and a New York Yankee; Terry’s partner, Allen (Ferrell), is a dweeby forensic accountant who got bumped up to the bull pen. These sad sacks live in the shadow of two macho supercops—kudos, Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson!—renowned for their sexy, property-damaging style of law enforcement. Fate hands Terry and Allen a break; the film, meanwhile, gives Wahlberg and Ferrell beautiful opportunities to turn their anger-mismanagement-meets-milquetoast act into an absurdist version of Abbott and Costello. Forget the film’s limp attempts to send up Lethal Weapon movies while still delivering boom-boom–bang-bang thrills; you can also ignore the gossamer excuse for a plot involving a financial bigwig (a wasted Coogan). Like McKay and Ferrell’s other collaborations (Anchorman, Talladega Nights), this comedy works best as an excuse for their bizarro Funny or Die!–style humor: hobo sex in a Prius, ironic soft-rock-sploitation, metaphors about tuna attacking lions. Whenever Wahlberg and Ferrell have to do anything other than trash-talk or infuriate each other, The Other Guys shoots blanks. Give these two wits some choice non sequiturs about pimping, Jersey Boys and highly elaborate sex play, however, and you’ve got the makings for a new smart-stupid franchise. David Fear]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[M Night Shyamalan’s po-faced fantasy epic were half as much fun as its ridiculous title suggests, it might have been possible to salvage a smidgen of entertainment from it. Instead, one is bored and stupefied by what seems like an eternity of vacuous spectacle, cod-Buddhist tosh and clunking dialogue. Even more embarrassing than the risible ‘Lady in the Water’, this wildly misjudged farrago is portentous but never profound, laughable but not remotely funny and action-packed without ever being exciting – all in fuzzy, retro-fitted 3D. Having been awol for 100 years – during which time the world was thrown out of balance (yawn) and the bellicose Fire Nation conquered the peaceful Southern Water Tribe with their fearsome war machines – the shaven-headed Aang (Noah Ringer) is released from a sphere of ice by two Water Tribe children, Katara (Nicola Peltz) and her older brother Sokka (Jackson Rathbone). It looks like Aang may be the mythical Avatar, the only being who can control all four elements: Earth, Fire, Water and Air. Various interested parties, including the Fire Nation’s vengeful, exiled Prince Zuko (Dev Patel), are determined to harness or suppress the Avatar’s powers. A series of confusing adventures, explosive battles and vaguely spiritual confrontations follows, while giant furry creatures float in the air, talking dragon spirits offer sage advice, and the moon turns red with shame. Devotees of the original Nickleodeon animated TV series swear this film adaptation is a travesty of its meaningful, allegorical themes – but most of them were aged between six and 12 when they first saw it. Either way, if your actual or mental  age exceeds this, steer well clear. Nigel Floyd]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Oliver Stone is back on the trading floor and Michael Douglas is back in the sharp suits for Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, an undisciplined attempt by the director of JFK, and W. at resurrecting his 1980s tale for modern times and combining melodrama with up-to-the-minute social and economic commentary. The characterisations are so broad and the plotting so wild that this revival, which screened out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival, is best viewed as a camp comedy and a knowing in-joke – albeit one that feels the need to plant economics lectures in the mouths of its cast so that it at least sounds like a serious attempt to take the pulse of our times.Jacob (Shia LaBeouf) is a mindful and smart young trader at a Wall Street bank, where he enjoys the support and mentorship of a banking boss of the old school (Frank Langella) and is on the verge of ploughing money into an eco-business he’s identified as a safe, responsible investment. But the good vibes can’t last. There’s a crash and an aggressive takeover by rival banking boss Bretton James (Josh Brolin, all cigars and motorbikes) sends his mentor tumbling onto the subway tracks and Jacob into Bretton’s more mercenary hands. The other hitch is that Jacob’s 'leftie' girlfriend is Winnie Gekko (Carey Mulligan), estranged daughter of Gordon (Michael Douglas), who’s on his way out of jail and not necessarily the reformed character he might appear.There are so many nods to the first movie and weak gags in Stone’s opportunistic resurrection of his 1987 film that it’s impossible to take seriously the film’s attempt to capture the financial zeitgeist. Right from the minute Gekko walks out of prison at the beginning of the film and retrieves an empty money clip and a huge mobile phone from the prison authorities, you know this is going to be an odd mix of a picture, halfpanto, half drama. You want to shout ‘Behind you!’ whenever a cigar-chomping, shiny-headed bad banker appears. Brolin’s Bretton is particularly wide: he owns a grim Goya painting and you expect him to grow horns and start cackling in front of it. LaBeouf is fine as the film’s calm conscience and Douglas, too, is an amusing presence, not too broad and obviously enjoying himself. The cameos lighten the mood even more: Charlie Sheen pops up as Bud Fox from the first film; Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter plays himself in an especially odd scene; and Stone himself twice rears his head disastrously. Mulligan comes out of the whole thing poorly: her character is a bit of a sourpuss and even though we’re supposed to feel empathy for her and her values, the film slyly sidelines her as a little too dull for its liking.The style is brash and obvious, as is often Stone’s habit: when someone tells Jacob, ‘You’ve got fight in you!’, we actually see the ghost of Langella in his mirror; when Jacob starts talking about the hydrogen-power firm he wants to support, we see all sorts of crass graphics and kids-TV science experiments flashing up on screen.Stone’s lightweight and soapy film feels like he threw a whole load of newspaper clippings at a tired plot about estranged fathers and a clash of values. The problem with this film is that if you put in front of a bunch of bankers, they’d laugh their heads off and feel a swell of pride at the thought that they inhabit a world as glamorous as that suggested by Stone’s indulging of the New York skyline and the trappings of excessive wealth. It’s hardly satire. This is a pulp novelisation of the banking crisis and its pleas for relevance ring very hollow. Dave Calhoun]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[All respect to Greenberg’s likable Greta Gerwig, but isn’t Rebecca Hall the real savior of today’s neurotic with a camera? You’ve already seen her as the more tortured American friend in Vicky Cristina Barcelona; in Nicole Holofcener’s occasionally sharp Please Give, she’s a wan NYC radiologist enduring a bitchy sister (Amanda Peet) and her own timidity. Part of Hall’s commitment comes from dowdying up (if you’ve seen her in Frost/Nixon, you know she can pop), but it’s also a willingness to go elbowy and awkward and let the smile crack through gently. Hall may be closer to Diane Keaton than any other actor of her generation.

Please Give provides Hall’s character, also named Rebecca, an oblique echo in neighbor Kate, played against her natural sass by the great Catherine Keener. Married and professionally partnered with an antiques seller (Platt), Kate is one of those lefty city dwellers embarrassed by her own comfortableness. When the movie meanders, as you know it will, to a straying-husband subplot and Kate’s own quest for purpose, you sigh and wish Holofcener had recognized the two-hander she might have crafted instead: a film about different generations of women surviving in the city.

The drama isn’t quite that, and if its edges are sanded down, that’s only because it wants to be round and inclusive. There’s some dangerously materialistic stuff in here involving a teenage daughter’s quest for designer jeans, but Holofcener (Lovely &amp; Amazing) has never been judgmental. She has real sympathy—characters that might have been brittle, mockable creations in another writer-director’s hands gain resonance here. But the filmmaker also might have very little to say apart from the way guilt enters into life, and then suddenly recedes. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[You’ve all seen the YouTube clip of Joaquin Phoenix 'melting down' on Letterman, and you’ve probably all seen the host of skits that came off the back of it, including Ben Stiller donning a touselled beard and shades at the Oscars and Natalie Portman asking why he looks like someone who works in ‘a Hasidic meth lab’.

Well, I’m Still Here is that same joke played over and over again. The film, by Phoenix's brother-in-law Casey Affleck, chronicles the fall and fall of the hirsute, bulked up Phoenix as he rants, mumbles and swears at anyone who enters his personal sphere. It's amusing as an induglent experiment in stripping back the layers of celebrity while looking at the autobiographical nature of acting. But as a movie, it doesn't really hang together. 

Director Affleck was, he claims, granted unrestricted access to Phoenix’s life as the one-time Hollywood golden boy took it on himself to instigate a calamitous career transition from acting (something he’s good at, but purportedly loathes) to rapping (something he’s bad at, but purportedly loves). This access includes observing the minutiae of Phoenix’s daily life, as he skulks around his house in low-slung brown cords, bullies his personal assistants (including a man who resembles Jarvis Cocker who, perhaps tellingly, always seems to be semi nude) and bellows obscene rap lyrics into the computer in his ramshackle home studio. Phoenix (if this is the real Phoenix) comes across as vile, petty and selfish. He has no qualms about his appearance or what other people think of him. The film is made up of half-formed sketches in which Phoenix comes across like a childish crank who’s escaped from his soap box at Speakers’ Corner. 

The pretence is that what we’re watching is a fly-on-the-wall documentary. The claim is that all these outbursts constitute just another madcap, coked-up, escort-ordering day in the Phoenix household. But despite claims to the contrary by Affleck, I’m Still Here feels entirely manufactured. The film’s rough storyline sees Phoenix trying to get Sean ‘P. Diddy’ Combs to produce his debut rap album, and although Combs doesn’t appear to be in on the joke, it feels like another tired spin on the Baron Cohen-style comedy of discomfort, where the line between the character and the act are subtly blurred.

But discussion about whether the film is a ruse or not feels beside the point: it looks too much like a ruse for a debate to be worthwhile. A scene in which his assistant takes scatological revenge on Phoenix in the night doesn't outrage because it looks like it was meticulously set up, night-vision camera and all. And lest we forget, Vincent Gallo has been doing the irascible maniac act for a number of years now, so the film's characterisation of 'Joaquin Phoenix' doesn't even feel all that new or exciting. Now, a film of Gallo trying to be pleasant and civil for a year? I'd pay to see that. David Jenkins]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Come in Lindsay Lohan: your time is up. Ever since you went off the rails we’ve been on the lookout for a feisty, freckled ranga with a straight-bourbon voice and killer comic timing, and we’ve found her in the form of Emma Stone, Easy A’s sexy breakout star. Stone is Olive Penderghast, a high-school high-achiever whose white lies about having lost her virginity get her branded the school hussy and soon have the school’s gay boys and losers queuing up to have their fictional way with her. While Olive revels in the attention of pretend skankdom, she craves an actual boyfriend and gets mixed up in the fraught marriage of two of her teachers (Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow). Bert Royal’s script leans more towards the library than the locker room, with Olive adopting the embroidered ‘A’ for adulterer of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter, which she’s studying in class, and snappy references to Sylvia Plath and Mark Twain. Will Gluck populates this glorious teen comedy with a gag-tacular cast, ranging from Amanda Bynes’ airheaded Jesus freak to Malcolm McDowell’s exasperated principal. But the whole show is practically stolen by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson as Olive’s liberal, life-loving parents who are amused by their daughter’s predicament and rather than lecture her keep her spirits up with deliriously funny banter. These are movie parents that everyone wishes they could have. Nick Dent]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[You’ve seen the noses buried in Stieg Larsson’s thrillers everywhere; even Zodiac’s mood maven David Fincher is preparing a Hollywood adaptation. Until that blockbuster arrives, fans will have to make do with a trio of Scandi-helmed movies that merely get the job done. While the books have the power to turn soccer moms into foreign-noir obsessives, their onscreen counterparts leave you a touch underwhelmed: crisp, functional cinematography, a generic dance throb for chase scenes and the riveting presence of Noomi Rapace, perfectly cast as punkish hacker-heroine Lisbeth.The Girl Who Played with Fire pushes her—and an investigative journo, Mikael (Nyqvist)—into a gruesome underworld of sexual abduction, with Lisbeth suffering a private history of abuse herself. Though play with fire she might, couldn’t screenwriter Jonas Frykberg have played with a little button called DELETE? There’s no reason why a two-hour movie should feel like three, nor require quite so much fidelity to Larsson’s plot curlicues; paradoxically, this only draws attention to an ugly pair of endgame villains straight out of a Bond movie. Downbeat and turgid, the brainy movie turns a literary sensation into summer homework. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[High-school senior Charlie St. Cloud has it all: a full college scholarship, friends who adore him—and he’s played by Zac Efron! The future is as bright as his piercing baby blues, which don’t look like they’ve seen a day of disappointment. But wait…is that a drunk driver there in the distance, barreling toward baby brother Sam (Tahan)?
Suffice to say that Charlie’s dreams are shattered in an instant. Suddenly, this toothily grinning extrovert becomes a brooding (but still perfectly groomed) recluse, working as caretaker for the local cemetery. His days are consumed by chasing a flock of shit-happy ducks, his evenings devoted to playing catch with Sam, since Charlie can now talk to the dead.
Cue those weepy violins. Indeed, you get everything you’d expect from this mostly saccharine melodrama: Hallmark aphorisms, picturesque locales, a St. Jude–stumping paramedic (Liotta). Yet it feels as if director Burr Steers is trying to cast a more complicated eye on things, to the point that Charlie’s otherworldly encounters waffle between seeming divine and delusional. And one scene—a nighttime idyll between Charlie and his soulmate-of-a-sort, Tess (Crew)—is like Mizoguchi gone tween. Shallow homilies ultimately dominate, but there’s a deeper movie trying to get out from behind the greeting card. Keith Uhlich]]></review>
