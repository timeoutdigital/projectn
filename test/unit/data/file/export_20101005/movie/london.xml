      <review><![CDATA[A subversive and psychologically rigorous take on RL Stevensons tale of severed souls, Dr Jekyll combines gothic horror, aristocratic romance and madcap Freudian psychodrama into a dizzying, exhilirating brew.<br />Fredric Marchs Jekyll exists in a state of unhappy Victorian reppression, unable to lay a finger on his bride-to-be until their wedding night and sorely tempted by Miriam Hopkins buxom harlot Champagne Ivy. Drinking his serum allows him to throw off the shackles of polite society, to get in touch with the unrestrained, wilfully brutish animal within.<br />But Mamoulians 1931 film is no voyeuristic fantasy: through a strikingly modern combination of subjective camerawork (by Karl Struss) and still-astounding visual effects, he makes it clear that Jekyll is no fiction: he is all of us, all the time. When, in the final scene, a police sergeant turns to the audience with an accusatory finger and a cry of thats the man!, itll be a stalwart soul who doesnt flinch back in his cinema seat.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Gillo Pontecorvos stirring anatomy of an urban uprising  the violent nationalist revolt in Algiers in 1956 and 1957  feels strikingly relevant today. It shows the real consequences of defying popular will with institutional aggression and military force, and of course there are those chilling scenes in which Algerian women, dressed as Europeans, plant four simultaneous bombs in busy public spaces The film arose directly out of the liberation movement it depicts: post-independence in 1962, former rebel Saadi Yacef was released from jail and, with the support of the new government, he invited the Italian filmmaker to dramatise his memoirs. The results are so fine  so modern  that I cant think of a better film born of a political struggle, or at least one that moulds political commentary with drama so effectively. The tone is mournful, the approach journalistic and the aesthetic direct as Pontecorvo reconstructs events on a grand scale on location in Algiers while never losing the intimacy of an Algerian woman quietly crying or a French couple walking past a checkpoint with the words Its nothing we need to worry about. Superb and unrivalled.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Some films dont age well, and no doubt David Lean and Noel Cowards story of two good married people, Laura (Celia Johnson) and Alec (Trevor Howard), who accidentally fall into the trap of infidelity but largely manage to handle themselves with straight-backed propriety, had more of an emotional effect in the social climate of post-war Britain. As it appears now, Lean and Coward only scrape the surface of their subject, as if merely to broach the issue of unfaithfulness in the happy suburban home was enough to have most audiences convinced. The films handling of physical attraction as Laura and Alec meet accidentally at a railway station and proceed to spend each Thursday afternoon together is a cop-out  a touch on the shoulder here, a snatched kiss there  and the wrench of forbidden and impossible love suggested so pointedly by the Rachmaninov music and by Leans imagery (such as Johnson deliberating whether to throw herself onto the railway tracks) is not matched by either the performances or the drama which are jarringly cold (bar some pleasing suave charm from Howard). For a non-hysterical approach, hunt down the DVD of Rohmers Love in the Afternoon instead.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Howard Hawkss late-period comic essay on the economic advantages of an ample bosom is not one of his best, though it just about works as a naughty Technicolor bellwether to these Sex and the City-fixated times. Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell play a pair of chesty chisellers aboard a cruise ship bound for Paris, forced to work their faux-ditsy charms amid a chorus of male admirers. While theres enough laboured screwball and gauche innuendo to raise the odd titter, its the kitsch background details that generate much of the fun: just try not to smirk at the flesh-toned underwear of the backing singers for Russells rendition of Aint There Anyone Here for Love?. Still, if camp comedy capering (dont call it a social satire!) isnt your thing, its worth the ticket to see Monroes iconic and flawlessly choreographed performance of Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend: a perfect four minutes of film.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of the monumental achievements in narrative filmmaking, Sergio Leones grandiose 1966 western epic is nothing less than a masterclass in movie storytelling, a dynamic testament to the sheer, invigorating uniqueness of cinema.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are their usual taciturn selves as rival gunslingers pursuing a cache of lost gold. So its left to Eli Wallachs Tuco to steal the show, the archetypal pitiable, self-deluded villain, the rotten heart of Leones colossal canvas.<br />Its hard to name another film with so many iconic, indelible sequences: Tuco following a trail of half-smoked cigars; the unmanned stagecoach thundering through the desert; the operatic Mexican standoff in the graveyard, as Ennio Morricones peerless score mounts over five nailbiting, wordless minutes. But what impresses most is the intimacy of Leones vision, sketching a vast array of ruthless characters with broad but subtle visual strokes, never losing sight of the humanity amidst the carnage.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This unheralded 40s melodrama is the lead title in the Lean centenary season at BFI Southbank, which adds to the argument that the emotional precision and sharp technical dexterity of Leans earlier, more modest offerings represent a more lasting legacy than his later spectaculars. An enterprising criss-cross time structure shapes Ann Todd and Trevor Howards turbulent relationship, as their romance comes back to haunt them after World War II since shes settled for a staid but secure marriage to banker Claude Rains. <br />Its adapted from a 1913 HG Wells novel, but the storytelling looks decidedly modern, and Leans direction works the material for all its expressive worth, even if Todds glacial screen persona and an opaquely written central role hardly bring out the best in each other. Rains steals the show, his clipped exterior masking unexpectedly touching feelings for his errant spouse. An illuminating reissue.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[I dont want any romantic hassles this week, says tycoon Edward (Richard Gere) as he waves his wad at hooker Vivian (Julia Roberts). Big mistake, as Vivian might say. Romance blossoms as the pair spend the week in LA; she shopping and warming the bed for him; he furrowing his brow over a deal. This re-release makes no bones about its old-school set-up, but this damsel in distress is a feisty entrepreneur ready to rescue her knight in shining armour right back. Sharp dialogue and great chemistry help make it a slick comedy that still stands up. Elements are dated: the soundtrack is full of karaoke classics and the wardrobe screams late 80s. Greed is good, too: money solves most of Vivians problems and even the romantic conclusion is a result of business-like negotiation. But this is a thoroughly enjoyable, character-driven romance that puts most current-day chick flicks  including Garry Marshalls Valentines Day  to shame.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Where would we be without Psycho? Fifty years on and Hitchs delicious cod-Freudian nightmare about a platinum-blonde embezzler (Janet Leigh) who neglected to consult a guide before selecting her motel still has much to answer for. It blazed a bloody trail for the much-loved slasher cycle, but it also assured us that a B-movie could be A-grade in quality and innovation. It dared to suggest that your star didnt need to surface from an ordeal smelling of roses (or, indeed, at all). It combined a knife, a scream, a melon, some chocolate sauce, Bernard Herrmanns greatest score and more than 70 edits to push the envelope of screen violence. It lent The Simpsons some of its best gags: (Seymour Skinner: Oh theres Mother now, watching me. Whats that, Mother? That sailor suit doesnt fit any more!). It offers perfect case studies of suspense, paranoia and montage for lazy film-studies tutors. And, of course, it was the first movie to show a toilet flushing, so we might also credit it with spawning the entire gross-out genre. Psycho: we salute you.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Spruced up in preparation for a fortieth- anniversary DVD release, Lionel Jeffriess 1970 adaptation of Edith Nesbits homely childrens novel still basks in a warm, rosy glow of universal nicety. Set in the early 1900s, the story  about three well-bred kids (Jenny Agutter, Gary F Warren and the excellent Sally Thomsett) having to leave their plush London home when Father is jailed for selling state secrets  is a celebration of old-fashioned British fortitude set in an environment of steam engines, buttercups, top hats and smocks. They then spend their days by the railway, waving at passengers, preventing disasters and hanging out with Bernard Cribbinss waggish station master. Putting aside its fusty look and feel, Jeffriess film remains an enjoyable evocation of the time. Of course, whether todays kids get it is open to debate.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The directors own favourite of his 54 movies, Yasujiro Ozus 1953 film Tokyo Story surveys the Japanese family in the American-influenced post-war reconstruction period. The story  never the Japanese masters greatest interest  is a simple one. It concerns the visits paid to their children in Osaka and Tokyo by an elderly couple (Tomi, 68, and Shukishi, 70) from the southern seaside town of Onomichi, a quiet fishing port and traditional centre of Buddhist devotion, which was then a day and a nights train journey from the high-rises, smoking factories and modernity of Japans frenetic capital.<br />Often topping lists of the best films of all time, and a great influence on many great directors of the last half century, not least for its purity of expression, this remains one of the most approachable and moving of all cinemas masterpieces. Furthermore, Ozus style  with its so-called pillow shots (introductory shots of yet-unhabited rooms), low, static camera position, unhurried pacing and elaborately composed frames  has come to look, in an age of refreshed minimalism, more and more modern. Also, his main interest  how ordinary human emotions are expressed in the context of the changing modern family  has become ever more fundamental, relevant and richly rewarding.<br />Ozus is a cinema of cumulative impact. The films early scenes delve into the cluster of families around Tomi and Shukishi  busy doctor Koichi; no-nonsense hair-salon owner Shige; sweet widowed daughter-in-law Noriko  observing their variously neglectful or dutiful relations with little or no introduction. Shukishi goes on a sake binge with old pals and they discuss their estrangement from, and disappointment with, their offspring. You could say that learning to deal with disappointment is the philosophical, even religious, heart of Tokyo Story. And the way Ozu builds up emotional empathy for a sense of disappointment in its various characters is where his mastery lies.<br />Not that the film is without irony, lightheartedness or downright comedy  No Weddings and a Funeral, anybody? Ozu had fun  and an estimated 43 bottles of sake  collaborating with scriptwriter Kogo Noda on Tokyo Story, and his films are as full of spontaneous insights and significant personal detail as those of Ozu-admired Hollywood comedians Ernst Lubitsch or Leo McCarey. But, like Hitchcock, Ozu planned and storyboarded everything with minute precision; no cutaway to a stone lantern or line of washing is accidental and the slow arc of his film must be attentively imbibed for the films overwhelming force to be truly felt.<br />None of this would be true, of course, were it not for the strength of the performances, and Tokyo Story is remarkable for the balance and richness of the ensemble playing by such Ozu regulars as Chishu Ryu (as Shukishi) and, especially, the marvellous, eminently graceful Setsuko Hara whose line, Everyone has to look after their own life first, is all the more shocking coming as it does from one of the most radiantly selfless characters in the history of cinema.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In the opening credits of this 1948 old-Hollywood classic, the legendary German directors name is Americanised as Max Opuls. Somehow its appropriate, because from its painstakingly designed interiors to its sweeping, fluid camerawork, from its overblown score to its devastating central performances, Letter From an Unknown Woman is suffused with opulence. But this is no Sternbergian exercise in glamour: in telling of young Viennese dreamer Lisa (Joan Fontaine) and her desire for an unattainable man (Louis Jourdan) and the high-style world he inhabits, Ophls comes down on the side of the outsider, those of us with our noses pressed up against the glass. So for all its florid melodramatic trappings, this grand, heartbreaking masterpiece resonates with sad, simple truths: just because one can appreciate beauty, that does not make one beautiful, and just because one loves does not mean one is loved.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>There are plenty of reasons why you might dislike Im Not There, Todd Haynes crazy jigsaw of a sort-of biography of Bob Dylan that breaks all the rules without writing any new ones. If youre a Dylan nut, you might object to the loose telling of the facts  What? Youre telling me that Suze Rotolo and Sara Lownds were the same person and that Dylan fathered two daughters with her? That kind of thing. Alternatively, if you know next to zilch about Dylan, you might find yourself all at sea amid Haynes torrent of wink-wink references and playful, fold-in, fold-out approach to events in the artists life. And, finally, if youre one of those who cant stand Dylans songs or hear anything in them beyond an excoriating whine, well, sorry, but you may find yourself reaching to employ your popcorn as earplugs: the film is packed with his music, performed by the man himself and a clever line-up of cover artists, from Sonic Youth to Cat Power to Calexico.</p><p>The recipe is famous. Six actors. Seven Dylans  none of them called Dylan. Colour. Black-and-white. Backwards and forwards. Forwards and backwards. Selective memory. Abstract concepts of character. The deconstruction of images and speeches. Marcus Carl Franklin, a 13-year-old African-American actor, plays the spirit of a teenage Dylan meshed with his hero Woody Guthries vision of the highways and byways of the depressed 1930s nation. Heath Ledger is a late 60s film star who is wrestling with a failing marriage to a celebrated painter (played by Charlotte Gainsbourg). Christian Bale is two Dylans: first Jack, a protest singer in early 60s Greenwich Village, then in the late 70s John, an evangelical preacher in the dreary suburbs. Richard Gere is a reclusive Bob, framed in the territory of Peckinpahs Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid and playing Billy as a disguised, wandering survivor of Garretts blood-lust. Then theres Cate Blanchett, all cheekbones and mercurial, as Pennebakers black-suited Dylan and who exists in a world where verit meets Richard Lester meets Fellini. And, lastly, theres Ben Whishaw who evokes Dylans love of Rimbaud and hatred of questioning with his back to the wall in an interrogation set-up.</p><p>Whatever your prejudices, if youre sick of films that treat the lives of artists  musicians, especially  in the same, predictable fashion, then you should thank the high heavens for Im Not There. Too often, we watch and groan as artistic inspiration is presented as a corny eureka moment (I still havent forgotten the sight of paint dripping to the floor of Jacksons lavatory in Pollock) and domesticity is offered as a barrier to expression and later as a refuge from the fallout of that expression. Too often, too, a film claims to offer the last word on a life. Haynes is pretending to offer no such thing. His approach is honest: its the reflection of a life through the mirror of experimental film. Its an acceptance that contradictions and interpretations and even mistakes are more acceptable than a biography preached as if from a pulpit.This is a typical blurring of form from a director who has already rethought the lives of Karen Carpenter and David Bowie and who looked afresh at the work of Douglas Sirk in Far From Heaven. ts not a perfect experiment. At several points, it loses its strange rhythm, only to be rescued by the music itself, which is always well chosen and placed. At other times, Haynes is too much in debt to his sources, such as Pennebakers films, or he fixates for too long on a single thought, such as that which sees Gere wandering through a carnivalesque landscape in the late nineteenth century. But the films best ideas  such as Franklins Woody strumming in the lounge of his proud, white adopted family or Ledgers Robbie wandering out of a Nicholas Ray-style film-within-a-film to fall in love with Charlotte Gainsbourg and later to reject her  are smart, playful and ensure that as a fractured, highly personal biography, Im Not There is full of intriguing arguments, movements and performances.<br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of the more curious aspects of recent Hollywood cinema has been a desire to make the conceptually outlandish psychologically mundane. Yeah, Christopher Nolan invites us to think, when you put it like that, I can see why a guy might dress up as a bat and fight crime. Peter Jackson doesnt just want us to marvel at or pity a 20ft ape, he wants to unpack its abandonment issues. And recently, Wes Anderson granted a talking animal enough pop-psych introspection to acknowledge, I have this thing where I need everyone to think Im this quote-unquote Fantastic Mr Fox.<br />Spike Jonzes adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are, Maurice Sendaks beloved story about Max, a naughty boy in a wolf suit who sails away to an exotic jungle and meets giant beasties who make him their king, takes this tendency even further. In expanding the couple of dozen pages of Sendaks picture-book to feature length, Jonze and his co-writer, Dave Eggers, approach atavistic fantasy with jarring formal and psychological realism. The forest, desert and mountain locations are real, as are the creature costumes (CGI facial expressions aside); beautifully photographed, often in handheld shots and magic-hour light, these landscapes and figures have a solidity, weight and detail that feels uncanny in an age of virtual imagining.<br />Lumbering around their island with satisfying heft, these weird beasts  hybrids of human, animal and mythical parts that faithfully realise Sendaks drawings  have an oddly quotidian social dynamic and comically normal names: insecure Judith and Alexander (voiced by Catherine OHara and Paul Dano), more assured Ira and Douglas (Forest Whitaker and Chris Cooper), gruff but vulnerable Carol (James Gandolfini). Feeling less like a pack of monsters than a group of long-arrested adolescents left to their own devices, they entertain crushes, grudges and neuroses, pile gleefully into group projects, sustain minor injuries and go off in sulks, yearning for structure and security all the while. Think Lord of the Flies on Fraggle Rock. Finding himself in loco parentis, Max must take emotional responsibility, and one of the films pleasures is young Max Recordss deft and unaffected portrayal of this shift. <br />Its hard to guess whether many children will enjoy the movie. Ponderous at times, it could probably be 15 minutes shorter and lacks a real sense of mortal danger. Theres also sometimes an over-determined feel to the correspondences between the island adventure and Maxs real life with his mother (Catherine Keener) and sister, as laid out in the opening scenes. But Where the Wild Things Are stands out for its unusually potent evocation of the timbre of childhood imagining, with its combination of the outr and the banal, grand schemes jumbled up with delicate feelings and the urge to smash things up.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This intriguing and revelatory blend of human drama and art-history detective work argues that Rembrandt peppered the canvas of his masterpiece The Night Watch with a cleverly coded attack on the Amsterdam bigwigs whose egos he was commissioned to flatter. Deftly combining character study and cultural documentary, it marks Peter Greenaways return to the cinema after years of museum installations and multimedia work. Hes been guilty of patience-testing pretension in the past, but this is impressively focused and accessible, shaped around a truly expressive balls-out performance from Martin Freeman as Rembrandt. Whats surprising (in the context of Greenaways often chilly past oeuvre) is the films genuine compassion for the sufferings of wives, maids and vulnerable orphans, adding an emotive underpinning to its sharp observations on the purpose of art and the nature of representation. Its not just Greenaways best film in years, but one of his best films, period.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The centrepiece of BFI Southbanks Mikio Naruse season (see Other Cinema), this brilliant melodrama is a contender for reissue of the year. Its a film which encapsulates the strengths of this masterly Japanese director whose work has barely been seen here. Hes known as a great director of actresses, and his signature performer Hideko Takamine is outstanding as a middle-aged hostess struggling to maintain her self-respect in the sleazy whisky-lubricated environs of Ginzas bar circuit, as she wrestles with the dilemma that the admirers who could offer her financial security demand her reputation in exchange. Battling to support her family and keep her own long-suppressed emotions in check, each night that she climbs the stairs to smile at the clientele is a painful reminder of her limited options. Fascinating as social study, painstakingly assured as storytelling, this compares with Sirks All That Heaven Allows and Fassbinders Fear Eats the Soul as a heartbreaking portrait of a defiant woman outflanked by the repressive mores around her. A new classic.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Disney has pulled off a bit of a doozy with this amusing parody of its own oeuvre. Ostensibly a freewheeling blend of the Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty fairytales, Enchanted begins in conventional, animated Disney territory where pretty Giselle is being courted by Edward, her Prince Charming. His witchy mother, however, has an evil scheme on the boil and banishes Giselle to twenty-first century New York City. <br />At this juncture, the film flits from animation to live action just as Giselle (now Amy Adams), dressed to the nines in a flowing ball gown, emerges from a manhole into a world of bustling humanity. Her first real-world encounter is with divorce lawyer Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey), who, despite sensing correctly that shes well away with the fairies, eventually relents to her request for shelter and  lo and behold!  begins <br />to fall for the scatty lass. When Edward eventually appears (in the guise of James Marsden), Giselle is left facing a typically predictable rom-com dilemma.</p><p>At first glance, Kevin Limas contemporary urban fantasy looks hideously twee. Its only when the story hits the streets of NYC and Adams starts hamming it up (much like Julie Hagerty did in Airplane) that we start seeing the fruits of a grand Mickey-take. Giselle is clearly on another planet; she swans around singing inane songs and delivering amusingly mundane fantasy lingo in a shrill voice. Had Adams (no relation) not hammed-up her performance to such a degree and, more pertinently, had the film taken itself seriously, one might otherwise have felt compelled to torch the screen. Instead, Enchanted is one of the better family films of this year.<br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Based on Antonio Pennacchis bestselling novel, Il Fasciocomunista and written by Italys premier screenwriting duo, Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli, this is as lively, witty, funny and intelligent a meditation on Italys Fascist inheritance as were likely to get. <br />Coursing through the 60s, it follows the mirrored experiences of two politically-divided brothers from working-class Latina (the Mussolini-built town outside Rome used by Paolo Sorrentino as the symbolic locus for The Family Friend): awkward, interrogative Accio and his older Casanova-skilled brother Manrico. As mothers favourite, Manrico gets ever deeper involved with the revolutionary left, while the sharp-tongued contrarian Accio, expelled from his seminary, falls under the influence of dogmatic father-figure, Mario and his band of thuggish Fascist aristocrats, occasioning fraternal punch-ups on the picket lines and stretching the battling brothers mutual loyalty to the breaking point.<br /><br />Lacking the length and depth of Petraglia and Rullis magnum opus The Best of Youth, Luchettis film nevertheless covers much the same ground in entertaining, serio-comic fashion. A great deal of the films lightness and humour comes from the acting, not least the delightful, spiky and engaging performances of Vittorio Emanuele Propizio and Elio Germano as the adolescent and mature Accio. <br />Its a fundamentally satiric, domestic vision of a destructive civil war that serves a gentle critique of the more po-faced heavy examinations of Italys past (including the writers own) which manages to evoke, but never trivialise, the mad, internecine conflicts of recent Italian political history. Sprightly-directed, it is only slightly spoilt by an unnecessarily grand and overly sentimental ending.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Adapted from the best-selling novel by Afghan-born American writer Khaled Hosseini, this accessible, deftly-directed and moving tale of childhood regret and adult atonement courses through three decades of war-torn Afghan history in personal terms. In 1978, preceding the Soviet invasion, privileged seven-year-old Kabul boy Amir (Zekeria Ebrahmi) witnesses the rape of his friend and fellow kite-flyer, lower-class Hazara servant Hassan (the expressive and contained Ahmad Khan Mahmidzada) by the malevolent Assef. Confused and angered by his own powerlessness, guilt, and shame, Amir frames his erstwhile companion for theft and is further admonished by the morally pure, loyal and self-abnegating behaviour of his victim, something that troubles the aspirant-writer Amir through his 20-odd years of exile in the US. In the present, a visit to Pakistan to see his dead fathers dying friend, offers news of Hassans fate, and prompts the older, now-married Amir (Khalid Abdalla) to a dangerous visit to his now Taliban-controlled home.</p><p>Notwithstanding the inevitable tendency of individual stories set against momentous national upheavals to conflate and simplify historical events, Marc Finding Neverland Forsters film achieves minor miracles within the bounds of his broadly conventional narrative. His sober approach allows a surprising level of complexity in his films wider interest in themes of guilt, displacement, honour and conflicting traditions, while his sensitivity to the emotional responses of his characters  both adult and child  is never overwhelmed nor upstaged by his incorporation of challenging dramatic scenes (such as a startlingly brutal stoning of an adulterous couple in a Kabul stadium). Likewise, the films belief in the power of redemption and its subtle assertion of the need for moral courage in personal (or political) conflict, is never allowed to get in the way of its boldly told, intelligent, informed and affecting story.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>This traditionally animated film from the director of Kirikou and the Sorceress breathes new life into a dying art. Trouble is, it remains to be seen how most kids will take to such a languorously paced film. </p><p>The Princes Quest is a wondrous, if overly simplified, spin on the Arabian Nights series of Middle Eastern stories that centres on two competitive boys from different backgrounds: Azur is the blonde, blue-eyed son of a nobleman, while olive-skinned Asmar is of Arabian descent and the son of Azurs nanny, Jenane. She reads them stories about the incarcerated Djinn fairy and they become so besotted with the tale that, years later, they compete in a quest to rescue the legendary pixie. </p><p>But which lad will get there first? Michel Ocelots enchanting parable is admirable in the way it tackles the concepts of prejudice, respect and tolerance, but its the vivid quality of the inspired, enchanced silhouette animation that leaves the most lasting impression. <br />Splendid stuff.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[With a setup familiar from Lost in Translation, a plot similar to White Noise and a monster recognisable from Ringu, J-horror remake Shutteris little more than a mish-mash of random and increasingly blatant references disguised as a movie. Ben (Joshua Jackson) is a photographer returning to his Tokyo studio with new bride Jane (Rachael Taylor) in tow. <br />But a series of mysterious ghostly blurs on Janes holiday snaps lead her to investigate the phenomenon of spirit photography, by which images of the dead can be caught on film. Soon she and her increasingly shifty-looking hubby are inextricably entangled in a web of lies, flies and herky-jerky long haired ghost-women.<br />Despite one or two effective scares and an unnerving strobelit sequence, Shutteris instantly forgettable stuff, never even attempting to transcend its low rent multiplex status. Throwing in daft plot twists every few minutes for its undemanding teen audience, the film ticks along harmlessly enough without ever managing to leave a lasting impression.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Click here to read an interview with director Bigelow<br />Best known for 1991s Point Break, Kathryn Bigelow is back in the frame with one of the better films about the US Army in Iraq  and one of the few not to send American audiences running for the hills. Written and co-produced by war reporter Mark Boal (who worked on Paul Haggiss In the Valley of Elah), Bigelows film combines an expert management of tension with a sensitive and journalistic attention to detail: she has one eye on the truth and the other on the multiplex, and, if you can forgive her the odd sentimental or sensational flourish, this makes for an unusual mix of the thrilling and the sobering.<br />The films focus is a bomb disposal squad in Baghdad in 2004 and the 38-day rotation of Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner, pictured), an expert in defusing devices and a mouthy renegade whom you could view as either hot shit, as one superior calls him, or deserving of a sock in the jaw, as one of his peers prefers. Bigelow builds suspense and empathy by sticking closely to this small band through several episodes  including one superbly executed desert gunfight  and allowing us to experience events as they unfold for the soldiers. <br />The photography from United 93 DoP and regular Ken Loach collaborator Barry Ackroyd lends a frenetic immediacy to proceedings, while the use of Amman as Baghdad lends context and reality to a claustrophobic story. Bigelow is more interested in psychology than politics, but she shows just enough awareness of how the behaviour of soliders can fuel retaliation and even includes one direct suggestion that the US Army can and does choose to disregard the welfare of civilians. Most encouragingly, the film offers a fine distinction between heroism and heroics.<br />Click here to read an interview with director Bigelow<br />]]></review>

The root of this existential brooding, we learn, is the war these teens have been coerced into fighting between rival corporations. Despite a stunning aerial-combat opening, the film soon shifts into a sequence of slow-burning discussions during which the grim circumstances of the Kildrens situation are revealed. Vibrant backdrops lend the film an aesthetic buoyancy, but their real function is to conceal the darkness at the heart of this most melancholy of movies.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The incessant yowl of bawling babies is not something youd expect to hear in your average prison movie. But then, Pablo Traperos militantly unsentimental chronicle of life in the maternity wing of an Argentinian womens prison is no Shawshank Redemption. Martina Gusman delivers a magnificently understated turn as Julia, locked up on the back of a bizarre murder rap (we never discover the extent of her guilt) and carrying the child of her dead lover. She is our guide on the inside, initially petrified at the prospect of bringing up her child in such grimy and violent surroundings but soon learning to work the intensely restrictive system to her advantage.<br /><br />Part meticulous character study, part hyperrealist drama, Traperos film is as interested in documenting how such an institution functions on a day-to-day basis as he is in presenting the joys and pains of female cohabitation in such a confined space. His film also asks us to question whether its right that the young innocents should suffer the same punishment as their errant mothers. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Id rather be a good nobody than an evil somebody is the mantra for this undistinguished animated Frankenstein comedy spin-off. Igor is one of many identical-looking hunchbacks who aid the kingdom of Malarias evil scientists with their wicked inventions. Igor (voiced by John Cusack) has a face like Peter Lorre and a demeanour far removed from his master, Dr Glickenstein (John Cleese). Hes also more intelligent than his fellow hunchbacks. <br />So, when Glickenstein accidentally expires, Igor sets out to prove his worth by inventing the most monstrous of all monsters in Eva. However, Eva turns out to be more caring and thoughtful than destructive, and eventually persuades Igor that more comes out of being good than being bad. The animation here is vaguely Tim Burton-esque with a nod to Ralph Steadman in some of the outlandish characters, especially that of Eddie Izzards key villain, Dr Schadenfreude. But theres not much form to the plot which develops in fits and starts. Nevertheless, those kids that werent confused appeared to enjoy it, so there you go.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The tiny changes in human behaviour that occur when faced with loss is a theme that Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda has consistently explored in his films. 1998s After Life speculated on how people come to terms with the loss of their own lives, 2004s Nobody Knows offered a group of children forced to muddle through adolescence without parents and this extraordinarily tender and consoling new ensemble comedy provides a glimpse into the lives of a lower-middle class Yokohama family on the day they come together to observe the anniversary of a loss in the family. <br />Its a summit of coiled emotion, a rare occasion on which parents, children and grandchildren can awkwardly air grievances while happily munching on sushi, eel and tempura. Despite the fact that every shot is loaded with anxieties about death (of family members, of tradition), the tone remains warm and ironic. The way Koreeda films  mostly discreet shots of the familys cramped suburban house  makes most directors look blind to the possibilities of locating ideas in mundane imagery, such as a drawer left slightly open, a butterfly entering the house, or cherry blossom blooming in the garden.<br /><br />His beautiful dialogue, too, favours gentle naturalism over characters breaking down and blurting out feelings, giving it a subtle universality: we see reflections of people we know and love in these characters. Koreedas almost sage-like understanding of what makes modern families tick places him and this wonderful film in the league of Japans grand master, Ozu, and you cant ask for higher praise than that.]]></review>

Asa (Askat Kuchinchirekov) is the adorably dim ex-sailor whose search for a significant other (specifically, enigmatic local beauty Tulpan) is constantly stymied by his blundering manner, an absence of farming prowess and a gargantuan pair of lugholes. <br />Yet his protracted period of doomed courtship gives us ample time to examine the fabric of this remote society, as questions about its sustainability, practicality and principles are all raised via involving and often absurd sketches that riff on the daily struggle.<br />Despite this being his first fictional film, Dvortsevoy exhibits the storytelling composure and technical proficiency of a veteran, while his keen eye for a pastoral poetic flourish places Tulpan firmly among the years most endearing cinematic experiences. And how many films can boast a single-take shot of a baby goat being born and receiving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The latest film from Donnie Darko director Richard Kelly arrives on these shores bearing the clawmarks of American critics. But dont panic: while its true that the films sci-fi antics are far from watertight in the logic department, theres enough eccentricity and ambition at play to charm and bemuse in equal measure. Building on the short story Button, Button by The Twilight Zone writer Richard Matheson, Kelly whisks us back to late 1970s Virginia. There we meet mid-ranking Nasa scientist Arthur (James Marsden) and his crippled schoolteacher wife, Norma (Cameron Diaz, below), whom Kelly recruits as two blow-dried lab rats for a deliciously overwrought interplanetary experiment. It begins when Frank Langella (missing a left cheek) knocks on their door, drops off a contraption with a red button on it and says that if they push the button, theyll receive a million dollars  but someone they dont know will die. <br />Shooting for the technology-driven guilt-racking of Michael Hanekes Hidden  but achieving something closer to the hysteria of the Saw films  Kelly comes unstuck whenever he strains to say something smart. Points, too, are deducted for mistaking cynicism for satire, as in his 2006 folly, Southland Tales. Yet Kellys crackpot-inventor approach to filmmaking (note the second-half pile-up of nosebleeding bodysnatchers, watery gateways to Hell and sundry Arthur C Clarke quotations) has produced a provocative, Lynch-lite paranoia flick that flaunts some fascinating ideas on the destructive power of technology, the bourgeois desire for conformity and the potential horrors of parenthood. It also features a great soundtrack by Arcade Fire.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Kitsch is most enjoyable when it doesnt know its kitsch. Everyone involved in Shutter Island  most obviously director Martin Scorsese and star Leonardo DiCaprio  seem to be taking this berserk, meandering story absolutely seriously, which only serves to make an already fun psychological thriller all the more ludicrous and entertaining.<br />The film is set in 1954. DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a US marshal dispatched to the titular oceanbound asylum to investigate the disappearance of a criminally insane inmate from her locked cell. He soon begins to suspect that this remote facility isnt all it appears  is Ben Kingsleys avuncular psychiatrist really as kindly and welfare-conscious as he seems? Why are the guards so heavily armed? And whats with the mysterious lighthouse that all the patients seem so terrified of? To make matters worse theres a hurricane coming in, the generators are on the blink and Teddys new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) is starting to look decidedly shifty. Taxi Driver this aint.<br />Actually, the Scorsese movie it most resembles is his previous exercise in Hitchcockian overkill, 1991s Cape Fear. With DiCaprio rather limp and forgettable in the lead, Shutter Island lacks the centrifugal might of De Niros powerhouse central performance in the earlier film. But it compensates with pure visual, aural and narrative excess: this is modern gothic taken to its (il)logical extreme, a work of pure operatic delirium. The closest Shutter Island gets to a commanding, De Niro-like presence might be its perverse, overbearing soundtrack, a selection of the most doom-laden pieces by modern composers ranging from Kryzstof Penderecki to Max Richter. Every twist in the tale is accompanied by a frenzied flurry of violins, every moment of violence underscored by a pounding, atonal piano crescendo.<br />While the narrative, adapted from Dennis Lehanes 2003 novel, is hopelessly convoluted, the film is held together by the sheer bludgeoning force of Scorseses directorial vision. Never one to shy away from visual overindulgence, Scorsese has used Shutter Island as an excuse to really throw open his box of tricks, chucking in gaudy but strikingly beautiful dream sequences, harrowing (if rather tasteless) concentration camp flashbacks and the most thunderous, howling rainstorms this side of Suspiria. <br />In fact, Argentos film, a similarly monumental and manic triumph of style over substance, may be the most appropriate comparison here. And while Scorsese may lack the giallo masters manic invention, the tension between his natural tendency towards old-fashioned Hollywood classicism and his evident desire to cut loose gives the film its strange, irrestistible power. As senseless, perverse and unwieldy as it undoubtedly is, Shutter Island might be Scorseses most enjoyable film in a decade.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Strictly half-term fodder it may be, but this amiable kiddie flick delivers on its promises: you get lots of dogs doing cute stuff. The set-up has a brother and sister (Emma Roberts, Jake T Austin, Identi-Kit moppets) struggling to keep their pet Jack Russell terrier a secret from their pernickety foster parent (Lisa Kudrow, a game meanie). An abandoned downtown hotel provides an ideal bolt-hole and, they begin to plot, could offer kinder accommodation for the citys unwanted canines than the municipal pound. With a couple of pet shop assistants facilitating transport and product-placement doggie treats, the dream becomes reality, thanks muchly to little bros Heath Robinson-esque contraptions keeping massed pooches fed and watered while the authorities try to work out where all the strays are.<br />True, theres only the merest suggestion of an education system for these juveniles, but credibilitys secondary when youve got lots of dogs doing cute stuff. Theres a treadmill for automated walkies, a canine-operated ball thrower, while bodily functions are catered for by production-line poop-scooping. A whole spectrum of breeds, shapes and sizes supply the aww-factor (pugs with aerobics headbands), but theres some welcome emotional underpinning too, since the foster kids need a good home as much as their four-legged friends. Enter Don Cheadle as a kindly social services officer: when they start giving actors awards for films theyd rather leave off their CVs, hell be up there on the podium.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Maintaining the gothic quirks of his debut, The Nightmare Before Christmas, but adding a welcome layer of queasy childhood angst, Henry Selicks adaptation of Neil Gaimans bestseller is an original, entrancing, occasionally worrying fairy tale. When inquisitive pre-teen Coraline discovers a secret door in her family home, she stumbles into a universe of apparent perfection  and underlying danger.<br />The films biggest draw has to be its intricate visuals, particularly in 3D. Selick plays with expectations superbly, presenting a drab, grey-hued world which slowly transforms into a dazzling phantasmagoria of talking cats, flying trapezes and a uniquely terrifying villain. This dark edge will be the biggest test of the film as a commercial prospect: it may be too terrifying for the target audience. But for braver kids  and parents  this is a thrilling, even challenging ride.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Youve got to admire the sheer, infectious force of Quentin Tarantinos personality. Is there any other popular American director, who, like Tarantino, is constantly ranting and raving about cinemas glorious past and giving young filmgoers reason to extend their DVD library back beyond Star Wars? Even the name of his new film is fondly stolen from a little known Italian movie of the 1970s. Its only when you turn to Tarantinos own films that things get more tricky. For the sad truth is that Tarantino, like cheap wine, just isnt improving with age.<br />Which is an awkward reality because Tarantino obviously wants to put away childish things with this new film. Not only does Brad Pitt close the film with the self-regarding line This may well be my masterpiece, but Inglourious Basterds is a little more restrained and a little more quiet than  films like Death Proof and Kill Bill. <br />I say a little because much of the film is not quiet at all: when the music comes, its loud; when the deaths occur, theyre gruesome, even sadistic; and when the plot kicks in, its pure, wild fantasy.<br />The film moves liberally between French, German and English dialogue and takes us through five chapters. First, in 1941, we see a Nazi, Colonel Hans Landa (played by Austrian Christoph Waltz), known as The Jew Hunter, discover and kill a Jewish family in France; only the youngest daughter gets away. <br />Then were introduced to the basterds, a gang of eight Jewish-American soldiers who, while deep undercover, roam Nazi-occupied France, murdering German soldiers and collecting their scalps. Theyre led by a Tennessee goodtime boy, played by Pitt, but oddly theyre not on screen much. Pitt is lively but he disappears for a long time and is upstaged by Waltz, who gives a teasing turn of sly comedy and cruel charm. His scenes are the films best.<br />For the films final chapters, we leap to Paris in 1944, where the two stories collide. The girl who fled the Nazis, Shosanna Dreyfus (Mlanie Laurent) is now running a cinema (of course) which plays films by Riefenstahl and Pabst. A Nazi private, Frederick (Daniel Brhl), takes a shine to her. It turns out that his gun-toting heroics are being immortalised in a film produced by Goebbels, who decides that Shosannas cinema is perfect for the premiere. Shosanna and the basterds decide that the screening is their chance to strike.<br />This might be a period movie, but still we clock Tarantinos signature style  the extended, know-it-all dialogue, the tricky gunplay, the pop-cultural nods. Theres even a Mexican stand-off  la Reservoir Dogs and the obligatory nigger reference, this time in French. But this lacks the stylistic pizzazz of Tarantinos best, and by putting more emphasis than usual on the chatter it makes it more obvious that the talk often lacks wit and verve.<br />Perhaps unsurprisingly, Tarantino takes the history of cinema more seriously than the history of Europe. References to films abound: Michael Fassbenders British spy (who has an amusing, if silly, Dr Strangelove-like scene with a superior played by Mike Myers) used to be a critic and regurgitates what sounds like a Wikipedia entry on German film, while another character wonders whether he prefers Chaplin or the French silent actor Max Linder.<br />Whats not clear is what Tarantino wants to achieve: Inglourious Basterds is an immature work that doesnt know whether its a pastiche, a spoof, a counterfactual drama, a revenge tragedy or a character comedy. How can we, within a space of minutes, feel adult sympathy for a hunted Jewish family and then childish glee when a Nazis skull is crushed with a baseball bat? The one cancels out the other. <br />But perhaps the biggest faux pas is introducing real historical characters. Tarantinos inventions are big enough  not least Waltzs terrific movie Nazi  so why does he have to court implausibility by dragging in a  loony Hitler (Martin Wuttke, nothing special) and introducing Goebbels? You might imagine, too, that this film was written in the 60s: Tarantino seems blithely uninterested in more than 60 years of slow reconciliation between Europe and its past.<br />Subtle is not a word in Tarantino's lexicon. At the films heart is a fatal attempt to conflate fact with fiction and a celebration of vengeance thats misplaced and embarrassing. Loyal fans expecting a familiar patchwork of Tarantino tics and quirks  Pulp History or Kill Hitler  might not be disappointed. Those expecting anything approaching progress, cinematically or ideologically, probably will be.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Dreamworkss animated sci-fi offspring centres on the gigantic misfortunes of Susan Murphy, a feisty young thing with a crush on TV weather-dork Derek. When a meteorite strikes their wedding ceremony, Susan is affected by fallout and grows into a 50-foot chick with attitude. Shes taken to a secret underground facility where she meets her freaky co-stars, BOB (a gelatinous blob), Mr Cockroach, Missing Link (half-fish, half-ape) and a hare-brained maggot called Insectosaurus.<br /><br />Some chucklesome Airplane-style humour is unleashed during this early stage as Susan (renamed Ginormica) tries to come to terms with her size, her surroundings and her wacky new friends. But as any filmmaker knows, theres only so much jollity kids will endure before they yearn for some evil influence to stir things up, and here its in the unoriginal form of an invasion from space. Will Ginormica and friends defeat the evil aliens and, more to the point, will she ever be able to return to a normal life with Derek?<br />Monsters vs Aliens is skilfully animated and spasmodically funny, but you get the impression the films seven (!) writers ran out of ideas two-thirds of the way through, opting for a conventional succession of overwrought combat sequences and feverish hyperbole. The film is screened in both 3D and 2D, but aside from a handful of impressive 3D effects, youd be equally well-served opting for the two-dimensional version.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Michael Hanekes extraordinary new film is a black-and-white ensemble piece set in a north German village on the eve of World War I. Its a sombre, roving drama that recreates the rituals of a rural Protestant community and imagines the private lives of its householders  the doctor, the baron, the pastor  to show how hierarchical, patriarchal and even feudal such a community may have remained even as the guns were being primed on the Western Front.<br /><br />Its a film thats broader in its focus and less direct in its efforts to shock and tease than 2005s Hidden, the Austrian directors last original film (if you skip his American remake of Funny Games in 2007). Yet it also feels like a continuation of a sort of storytelling that he developed further with Hidden. In that film, the racial guilt of an entire nation was projected through Daniel Auteuils hunted Parisian intellectual, and here again Haneke sets a drama in one period to explore issues relating to another. The White Ribbon, too, is an open-ended mystery about a crime or crimes. However, while in Hidden Haneke used the present to ponder its relationship with the past, here he does the opposite, using the past to reflect on that eras future.<br /><br />Crucially, The White Ribbon is narrated by a man whose elderly voice suggests hes relating events to us from the perspective of the 1960s or 70s. In the film, hes a sympathetic 31-year-old teacher who educates many of the children who creepily roam the village in packs and whom we see subjected to extreme discipline and punishment (and in one case, sexual abuse) at home. The teacher is not from the village, which probably gives him a more objective eye, but hes present as a series of events occurs: a doctors horse is tripped up by a wire; a woman dies in a sawmill; a barn is set ablaze.<br /><br />Our narrator suggests at the start that what we witness may explain what came later. Which, of course, this being a German story in 1913, turns the mind to fascism. One looks at the faces of the films large cast, especially its children, and wonders what would their relationship be to National Socialism? But to linger too long on such literal questions is an error. This is art, not science, and I dont think that even Haneke, that most rational of filmmakers, believes one could trace a direct line from his village to the behaviour of a nation two decades later. <br />What he offers are merely suggestions as to why a people might turn to antisocial behaviour, whether its as local as sabotaging cabbages and assaulting a disabled child or as national as following a leader whom you assist in carrying out crimes in your name. Id hesitate, too, to assume that Haneke is saying something specific about the German national character at this time. Lets not forget the key role of shame in this film: even the white ribbon of the title is a band tied around the arms of naughty children. Lets not forget, too, that it was partly the shame forced on Germany by the rest of Europe that led to the terrible events of the 1930s and 40s. <br />Faithful and striking historical reconstruction is evident throughout. The superb performances also lend a period authenticity to the film. Yet, theres also something essentially modern about Hanekes perspective: he peers into closed-off parlours and invades intimate moments (a father lectures a boy on masturbation, a child questions his sister about death) to suggest links between the psychology of domestic regimes and wider societal behaviour  links that few of these characters could have even conceived of in 1913. Its Hanekes investigative and quietly accusing contemporary eye that links repression in the home with corruption in the community beyond.<br /><br />As a thriller, this is much more muted and subtle than Hidden. The result is that theres more space for Haneke  and us  to consider the behaviour of his characters and the relationships between them. Its his least aggressive and most mature film  a masterpiece from a director who is increasingly making a habit of them.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A fairly clunky relic of Disneys spluttering 70s live-action output, 1975s Escape to Witch Mountain had the smart idea of putting two kids with telekinetic powers at the centre of a pursuit thriller. Effects technology may have progressed, but the idea of teen protagonists who can do cool stuff hardly dates for family audiences, hence this retooled version. Modernisation also brings a starring role for Dwayne The Rock Johnson, as a Las Vegas cabbie who picks up an unusual fare  two peroxide-blonde youngsters (Alexander Ludwig, Anna Sophia Robb) with a penchant for circumlocutory English, a wad of cash and the power to move objects at will. Turns out theyre extraterrestrials, whose mission to save their planet could have ramifications for our own survival, especially if theyre collared by shady government agents tracking them in a fleet of black SUVs.<br />Leading man Johnson manages to exude brawn while keeping within the bounds of the PG rating, but though amiable, his acting limitations are exposed by a plot requiring him to express wonderment at the interplanetary shenanigans. Theres no shortage of zingy (if derivative) material, but the filmmakers seem content with anodyne chase sequences and tired action moves, which register little impact. Its pacy all right, but glib and uninvolving for grown-ups, though perhaps furnished with enough in the way of spaceships, lasers and digital explosions to pacify undemanding little uns of an afternoon.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Live-action caper based on the original manga cartoon strip that started in the 1980s, Luke Perry look-a-like/act-a-like Justin Chatwin makes for an utterly nondescript hero as orphaned teenage martial artist Goku, whos forced to set aside his school studies in order to save the planet from the evil (and equally nondescript) Lord Piccolo by gathering up the seven mystic Dragonballs. Despite its relative brevity, its a garbled and monotonous film, comprising of the usual episodic trek around various disparate and exotic locations where a band of mostly superfluous hangers-on are assembled, one of which is Chow Yun-Fat as an ass-grabbing sensei and who, frankly, deserves better than this. Making no effort to be original, exciting, witty or even vaguely plausible, it may pass the time as sparkly fodder for 12-year-old boys with plenty of sugar in their bloodstream. Parents, meanwhile, will have to make do with sniggering at lines like The Dragonballs are within my grasp!.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Not since Jacques Doillons enchanting 1996 drama Ponette have the collective, small-scale traumas and vertiginous learning curve that come with a childhood on the lam been captured with such psychological diligence and hardscrabble poetics as in this autumnal, toddlers-eye heartbreaker. Drawing on memories of her own painful upbringing in the deprived outskirts of Seoul, writer-director Kim So-yeong delivers a miraculously poised and precise film examining a key stage in the upbringing of mop-topped sisters Jin (Kim Hee-yeon) and Bin (Kim Song-hee). <br />When loving but emotionally damaged Mom packs them off to live with their callous, self-serving aunt, the two girls find themselves in a dire predicament. Deprived of parental affection and behavioural boundaries, theyre left largely to their own devices (masterminding a miniature barbecued grasshopper business, of course) as their aunt drinks away her meagre income, showing little interest in the emotional needs of her surrogate brood. But matters improve when theyre marched off to their grandparents farm and finally locate a kindred spirit in their sagacious Grandmother, whose inconspicuous fondness for the pair comes across as a defiant act of cross-generational empowerment. <br />Via the disconcertingly unaffected performances of the two pint-sized leads, the film subtly and credibly charts the ways young children cultivate a sense of family, friendship, economy, age and geography through physical interactions with people and surroundings. Conversely, Kims film also offers a stark analysis of the human potential for random cruelty that recalls nothing less than Bressons Mouchette, albeit with a denouement that holds a glimmer of optimism for the future.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[You couldnt call this audacious British debut a success; its too arch, awkward and over-extended for that. But, oddly, its those very same qualities which make it arresting to watch and which mark out its two directors as talents to keep an eye on. Helen (Annie Townsend) is a plain-faced 17 year old in foster care who works part-time as a hotel cleaner and whose college mate Joy has disappeared in the woods of a town that looks and sounds like it might be Newcastle but is never identified. When the police arrive at Joys college looking for a stand-in for a reconstruction, they pick Helen, who takes to wearing Joys yellow coat, flirting with her boyfriend and even seeking help with her homework from Joys father. This is all executed in a peculiar, spooky fashion: long takes, disjointed episodes, a mixture of wide shots and a series of close-ups. The photography is striking  but even more striking is how extraordinarily wooden the performances and the dialogue are.<br /><br />Is this simply bad filmmaking? Or is it an experiment that only half works? Id go for the latter. What the directors are seeking is a metaphysical spin on a realistic set-up: an attempt to get inside and explore Helens head with a big, credible event as backdrop. We must assume, though, that Helens encounters are flights of fancy for a girl who has never enjoyed the same comforts as her peers, so the film is good on ideas of identity and how youngsters can project others lives onto their own to survive. It doesnt fully work, but its daring is enough to recommend it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p><i>Read an interview with the director here<br /></i><br />After the back-to-back bleakness of Brokeback Mountain and Lust, Caution, Ang Lee takes a well-deserved breather with this breezy, none-too-rigorous investigation into the men behind the iconic music festival. On one hand its a featherlight, surprisingly broad comedy which swallows the hippie-dream propaganda whole; on the other its a winningly un-cynical, warmly nostalgic tale of simple self-discovery.<br />Gay, Jewish and desperately seeking purpose, Elliot Tiber (Demetri Martin) leaves his liberated NYC existence to help his parents with their crumbling rustic motel upstate. Hearing about a major rock festival seeking a home, Elliott offers his small hometown as a venue, the motel as mission control and his own services as local liaison.<br />Anyone with an ounce of scepticism about the hippie myth will be infuriated by Taking Woodstock, a film so starry-eyed and winsome it would make Joni Mitchell blush. But leave those preconceptions at the door and theres a lot to enjoy here: hipster stand-up Martin is agreeably off-kilter in his first feature role, backed by a dizzying array of memorable supporting players, notably Imelda Staunton channeling Mel Brooks as Elliots crotchety, Nazi-obsessed mother and Brit theatre and TV actor Henry Goodman in a remarkable turn as put-upon dad Jake. <br />But the real star is Lees direction. Goosing Godard with an epic track through traffic, loading the screen with whirling naked bodies, withholding the epic scale of the festival until Elliot (and the cinematography) are blitzed to the gills on LSD, this may be a minor movie, but it displays the hallmarks of a major talent.</p><p><i>Read an interview with the director here</i><br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Filmmakers love a good prison. No, scrub that, filmmakers adore a bad prison. You can see why. For writers and directors, the volatile jail is a ready-made theatre, its prisoners and guards with their various conflicts and loyalties all perfect players for a drama that, if it tries hard enough, can reflect life on the outside too. <br />For French director Jacques Audiard (A Self-Made Hero, The Beat That My Heart Skipped), a master of the old-school French thriller  ie thrilling and meaningful  his fifth film offers the chance to pull off both a state-of-nation primal scream and a terrific crime flick. He gives us Malik (Tahar Rahim), a French-Arab convict who enters a concrete-and-steel hell to serve a sentence of six years (so we know he cant have done anything too dreadful). He tries to keep his head down, but this isnt that sort of place. The ruling bully boys are the Corsican inmates, led by ageing but vicious Csar (Niels Arestrup), who forces Malik to kill another inmate in a very successful scene thats one of the most claustrophobic and disturbing episodes Ive seen in a long while. From here, Malik is Csars vassal, committed to working for him on the inside and, later, using a series of day-release excursions to represent his criminal interests on the outside.<br /><br />But Malik is a clever individualist  a survivalist even  and at the same time that he learns to read and write, he exploits a friendship with another French-Arab prisoner, now released, to pursue his own drug deals and quietly invest in a power base within the jail. This is a world where partnerships are formed only for a reason, loyalties are fluid, friends barely exist at all. Politically, its a cynical film. Hope is absent.<br />Whether, though, it says anything meaningful about France, Im not so sure. Malik is an extreme character, so his experience doesnt reflect the French-Arab dilemma as a whole, even if the point is made about the number of immigrants in French jails and how being sent to prison for a minor offence can snowball into something else entirely. Audiard suggests that being an underdog  socially, racially, economically  in an unfriendly society can lead to desocialisation and anti-social behaviour. But Maliks story is so wild that it obscures such ideas.<br /><br />That said, its testament to Audiards skill at plunging us headfirst into a vicious parallel world that we mostly believe the films twisted logic and rituals. Also, his presentation of violence as a profit-and-loss account is effective and mature: while Maliks initial murder may get him far, we witness nightly visions of his victim coming back to his cell to haunt him. But there are several bite-your-tongue moments. The film is realist in style and mood, but for every five spot-on observations, there is one flight of wild fancy. Ive seen the film twice and still find baffling an episode in which Malik predicts that a deer will hit a car, thereby suggesting he is a prophet.<br />But the sheer force of Audiards direction can support such enigmas. It forces you, bullies you, persuades you to love his filmmaking style  even if not always to understand his motives.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[So whats killing the planet this week? Thats right, its food: specifically the kind of mass-produced, factory-farmed, chemically treated and genetically modified junk that we all know is bad for us  but we secretly love. Inspired by co-producer Eric Schlossers bestselling 2002 polemic Fast Food Nation, this solidly constructed documentary aims to do for food production what An Inconvenient Truth did for global warming: namely, to make audiences angry and politicans take note.<br />Its a somewhat bitty, dissolute experience  you get the feeling any one of these skimmed-over stories could have sustained an entire documentary. But director Robert Kenner succeeds in constructing a powerful, convincingly nightmarish vision of America on the slide: a country where marketability trumps sustainability, where public health is sacrificed in favour of profit, where labour unions are crushed and animal rights are an irrelevance. In recent years, films like The End of the Line have proved that movies are capable of provoking direct action: lets hope Food Inc can drum up the same fervour before we all succumb to the obesity epidemic.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Guy Ritchie the director and Guy Ritchie the screenwriter part ways for this latest spin on the Sherlock Holmes story, and if separation turns into divorce it would be no bad thing, at least on the evidence of this big-hearted, atmospheric entertainment. Shed of his tedious infatuation with off-the-peg London gangsters, Ritchie proves a competent teller of the fast-paced, not po-faced yarn. Here, Robert Downey Jr draws on his wild-eyed side to play the detective, while Jude Law assumes the more sober clothes of his sidekick, Dr Watson. Plunging into their careers mid-flow, we watch as they confront a conspiracy of national proportions. <br />They discover an aristocrat, Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), in the middle of a ritualistic murder of a young woman. In this early scene, Ritchies Holmes reveals himself as a physical titan in a witty interlude in which we witness in slow motion the microscopic details of his plan to incapacitate an assailant by brute force. The villain hangs, but, for Holmes and Watson, this is just the start of a series of fights, rescues, escapes and revelations, all cloaked in creaky supernatural mumbo jumbo.<br />Ritchies Sherlock Holmes is effective as a caricatured comedy adventure and shows some fidelity to Arthur Conan Doyle, especially in Downey Jrs portrayal of the eccentric but cold-hearted Holmes. The banter between Holmes and Watson isnt as witty as it should be, but the detectives lone mutterings, especially his deductions, are fun. The films biggest success is its evocation of Victorian London, via much location work and CG rendering: here, Ritchies grittily romantic view of our city comes into its own, culminating in a delicious climax on the girders of a half-built Tower Bridge.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[If there was a gold statuette for wall-to-wall compassion, Precious would wipe the floor with its rivals this awards season. Director Lee Daniels and writer Geoffrey Fletchers adaptation of Sapphires novel Push oozes empathy from the first scene to the last. Its inescapably bleak, but occasionally it has the confidence and spirit to emerge from the shadows of its tragic story  the tale of Precious (Gabourey Sidibe), an obese 16-year-old teenager in 1980s Harlem who is abused by her mother and father  to indulge in sly humour and jolly camaraderie before retreating again into the darkness at its heart.<br />My names Clarissa Precious Jones and I want to be on the cover of a magazine, says Sidibe. What she gets is less glitzy: we learn of the gross difference between the refuge of her mind and the reality of her life. When her vile mother (MoNique, grotesque, chilling but in the end almost sympathetic) screams, I should have aborted your motherfuckin ass, Precious imagines herself walking the red carpet at a film premiere. Perhaps most movingly, when she looks in the mirror, she sees a girl who is more beautiful and more white.<br />So, a better life is possible, but imagination just isnt enough: Precious is a film about real escape, not dreams. The film celebrates a winning combination of individual strength, education and community over the warped logic of the sort of corrupt household where a loveless grandma puts on a wig and feigns love for a Downs syndrome child, a piece of theatre to secure a cheque from a visiting social worker. Its a film that acknowledges poverty and inequality while refusing to believe that people cant escape from their grip. Its a truly American movie. Its realism is social  not socialist  and its happy flights of imagination recall the magical side of Danny Boyle more than the grit of Ken Loach.<br />Slowly, surely, Precious attends a special school with an inspirational teacher (Paula Patton), begins sessions with a social worker (Mariah Carey, unobtrusive) and fights her silent, violent and self-loathing tendencies to make new friends, a colourful bunch of girls in her class, from a mouthy Jamaican immigrant to a tough nut from The Bronx. Its not an easy battle and Daniels has a tendency to land new blows when you think the fight is over. So oppressive and extreme is Preciouss background that you imagine terrible things are about to happen even when theyre not. I didnt find the film as actively upsetting as many have reported  merely very, very sad.<br />The film arrives here after winning prizes at Toronto and Sundance and gaining four Bafta nominations. So, should you believe the hype? Yes and no. Precious is very affecting and has some great performances, especially from Sidibe and MoNique, but the film is arguably more heart than art. Is that such a bad thing? Perhaps not: when a film shines a light on a desperate way of life and gives dignity to characters barely ever portrayed on screen, you can forgive some clumsy, emphatic storytelling and a narrative thats too episodic and reliant on voiceover. Its a film full of life and love, well-meaning and, judging by the reaction in the US, a genuine and important phenomenon that says act  dont dwell  on your dreams. A genuine Obama-era movie, then. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A number of doom-laden docs have already highlighted the effect our lifestyles are having on the planet. Well, heres another one to cheer us up. The film has a simple message: modern technology has caused us to over-fish drastically our oceans and, unless something is done, well be eating jellyfish n chips by 2048. Director Rupert Murray (Unknown White Male) takes us to Newfoundland, where cod have been fished out of existence; to China, a country which allegedly altered its catch-quota results to give a false impression of its dwindling fish stocks; and to the Strait of Gibraltar where sushi favourite, bluefin tuna, is in steep decline. The poignant facts and figures are offered by a host of likeable marine scientists, local fishermen and activists. The film is both a strangely entertaining antidote to TVs excellent Trawlermen series, and a sobering call to arms.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The scramble to keep kids entertained over the summer months continues with this underwhelming spin on ET and Gremlins. Dragged off to a remote mansion for the summer months, precocious teen Tom (Carter Jenkins) and his self-obsessed sister Bethany (Ashley Tisdale) uncover a devious alien plot to launch a worldwide mind-control invasion from their loft. <br />Theres not a great deal to recommend: a few decent one-liners, some inventive anti-gravity slapstick and a brief but enjoyably bonkers remote-controlled kung-fu battle between one of the kids and Toms brain-zapped granny. But such fleeting charms are largely outweighed by an unexceptional script, a brace of shabby performances (from both kids and adults) and some dismal CG effects: the aliens appear almost transparent, like animated transfers barely clinging to the screen. Aliens in the Attic will probably prove an effective distraction for undemanding pre-teens; their parents might find it more of a chore.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Read an interview with Anderson here<br /></i><br />Take a few seconds to think back over Wes Andersons films and imagine how a stop-motion animated version of Roald Dahls Fantastic Mr Fox might look and sound if directed by this Euro-leaning, Texan caricaturist. Would it, like The Life Aquatic and Rushmore, offer a hyper-realistic uniform of sets and costumes? Would it, like The Darjeeling Limited and The Royal Tenenbaums, explore an eccentric family, with a father figure looming large and relatives at loggerheads? Would the soundtrack include the Rolling Stones? Would there be a role for Bill Murray? Jason Schwartzman? Owen Wilson? Would it be hip? Would the comedy have a gentlemanly sophistication and even be wilfully exclusive? Would it trade in emotions but feel distancing at times? <br />Of course, as anyone familiar with Andersons films will know, the answer to all these questions is yes. So it turns out: this is an animation, but its also a Wes Anderson movie. The difference is that its light on its feet compared to the heavy machinery of The Life Aquatic or the ponderous comedy of The Darjeeling Limited. Its also a kids film, which allows Anderson and his gang  is there another director so collegiate?  to have fun. Anderson himself voices a fey estate agent, and the film has the pace of a caper. <br />What remains to be seen is how audiences, especially children, will react to the jolty, bristling look of stop-motion animation in the age of CGI and digital 3D. The loving, handmade, purist look of the film, reminiscent of Gondrys The Science of Sleep, sees towelling as fields, cellophane as water and cotton wool as smoke, and will probably excite adults more than their kids who will be more taken by the constant, active missions of the plot  elements that, in turn, grow a little tedious if youre a grown-up.<br />Dahls book was a short, sharp affair illustrated in pen and ink by Quentin Blake, whose drawings dont have much bearing on Andersons version: his colour palette takes its cue from the autumnal hues of fox fur. The main characters in Dahls book were Mr Fox himself, a dapper chap trying to protect his family from danger, and his foes, three cider-swilling farmers, Boggis, Bunce and Bean. Anderson and co-writer Noah Baumbach (who directed The Squid and the Whale) have fleshed out the story so that there are more characters (Willem Dafoes jive-talking rat is genius) and the Fox family has more personality: Mrs Fox (Meryl Streep) is the voice of reason to her husbands impetuousness, while their son Ash (Schwartzman), a needy, moody teen, is pitched against a kung-fu-kicking cousin, Kristofferson (Eric Anderson), who comes to stay. <br />Mr Fox, voiced so appropriately by George Clooney, flits between human behaviour (buying a house, starting a career) and animal instincts (stealing chickens, attacking his food). The push and pull between the tame life and the wild one is the unifying theme. Its all very transatlantic  the setting and baddies are English; the animals are hip Americans. This is one crafty fox  in every sense.<br /><i>Read an interview with Anderson here</i><br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Although far better than its troubled history lead one to fear, this gory, gothic take on the classic lycanthropic love story has had its romantic heart ripped out. Returning to his estranged fathers crumbling pile in 1891  to investigate his brothers disappearance  actor Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) falls for his dead siblings mourning fiance, Gwen (Emily Blunt). But before this spark of love can ignite, Lawrence is bitten by the lunar-tic creature the locals fear, and must confront the beast buried within himself. With its mist-shrouded sets, gruesome slaughter and copious CGI, this is a surprisingly respectful updating of the 1941 Universal original. Thanks to Rick Bakers make-up effects, Del Toros transformations from handsome lover to hairy, howling beast are frighteningly convincing; Anthony Hopkins is restrained as his emotionally detached father; and a cruelly underused Blunt is all-a-quiver as the beautiful, bereaved Gwen. Ultimately, though, neither Joe Johnstons efficient direction nor Danny Elfmans hard-working score can lift the familiar storyline out of the ordinary. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Best wipe 8 1/2 from your mind, or at least delay seeing Fellinis loopy masterpiece, if youre going to enjoy this angsty romp through the directors 1963 film about a fictional Italian filmmaker, Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis), who loses his mojo and might be about to lose his marbles and his marriage.<br />Surprisingly, though, theres lots in this musical version, itself an adaptation of a 1980s Broadway show, that relates to the sombre heart of Fellinis original. We still get Guidos formative childhood memory of watching a prostitute perform on the beach (although this time it is Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas brilliantly belting out the films foot-tapping anthem Be Italian). We also get the lingering ghost of his mother (Sophia Loren!), the pain of his adultery and the madness of his creative impasse. Also, Fellinis meshing of dream and reality is oddly suited to the unreal tendencies of a musical, although its anybodys guess what the director would have made of Penlope Cruz throwing herself around in stockings and suspenders and upping the sex factor beyond anything Claudia Cardinale offered in the original.<br />The biggest difference, though, is that almost 50 years later, director Rob Marshall (Chicago) is able to play the story of 8 1/2 as a nostalgia piece. He fetishises the look and feel of 1960s Italy and especially Rome so that the films mood of artistic melancholia is expressed on a canvas that comes dangerously close to looking like an ad for Italian coffee. Marshall and his writers, including the late Anthony Minghella, also stress the humour of Guidos philandering, often preferring that his inner turmoil goes no further than chain-smoking. To give Day-Lewis his due, the actor grounds the films sillier tendencies in a charming performance of mercurial despair. Hes well supported by Marion Cotillard, who conveys the sadness of being Guidos wife, although both Nicole Kidman as his leading lady and Kate Hudson as an admiring journalist are little more than window-dressing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Taiji, Japan. A tourist town with a face it doesnt want anyone to see. Off-limits to prying eyes is an inlet where local fishermen carry out the clandestine slaughter of thousands of dolphins each year. Why kill these sea-going mammals, when the mercury-packed meat has to be re-labelled as whale to sell cheaply in supermarkets? Well, the demand from dolphin shows worldwide  which will pay 100, 000 per prime specimen  makes the cull economically viable. None of this is illegal, since the International Whaling Commission has no jurisdiction over dolphins and porpoises, but it is now being brought to global attention thanks to tireless activist Richard OBarry, at whose behest director Louie Psihoyos and his crew used risky subterfuge to capture shocking footage of these previously unseen iniquities.<br />Theres an effective thriller element to this vividly assembled doc, as we see surveillance equipment hidden inside fake rocks and champion divers planting underwater cameras under cover of darkness. Elsewhere, though the Taiji fishing community wont win any kudos for its diplomacy, theres also encouraging resistance from some local councillors battling for change. However, what lifts the film beyond effective consciousness-raising into the realms of human tragedy, is the startling irony that project instigator OBarry is none other than the trainer of 60s TV icon Flipper, whose popularity spawned the whole dolphin show explosion in the first place. The sadness in his eyes, a window on the churning emotions he must confront on a daily basis, proves the most haunting image in a film that will leave you better informed, tearful and really angry.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Sam Taylor-Woods first feature film is an astute rock n roll soap opera about the late teenage years of John Lennon. Its also a bit of a tease. In the opening scene we hear the first chord of Hard Days Night, the sound of screaming girls, a nod to Richard Lesters film of the same name and then nothing. In class, the distracted schoolboy John doodles walruses. On the way home, he passes Strawberry Fields. Much later, just as the film is about to end with John walking up a leafy street, about to leave Liverpool for Hamburg and history, his aunt mentions the change of his bands name from The Quarrymen to and, no, the name doesnt pass her lips. The film tiptoes around the future. The Beatles are the elephant in the scene.<br />In recent years, its become the rule that good films about musicians are formally loopy, while the less interesting ones play it straight. So its thumbs up for 24 Hour Party People and Im Not There and a pleasant shrug for Walk the Line and Ray. But Nowhere Boy shows no interest in redefining the form: Lennon was a pasty white bloke and so, unlike in Todd Hayness Bob Dylan film, its a pasty white bloke who plays him (the young, brooding Aaron Johnson, an actor who grows on you but is never quite right); the story is chronological; the narrator is reliable. Taylor-Woods background might be in video art but her approach to cinema is fundamentally different. She offers a conservative package with the odd radical flourish. Some of her choices, such as following Lennon and a pal as they ride on the top of a bus, are populist, even jarring, and suggest that she may not have fully found her own language on this first attempt.<br />Taylor-Wood and screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh mostly play it safe, offering an accessible period piece, free of nostalgia and full of key and credible emotional flashpoints. They focus sensitively on relationships, and especially those Lennon had with his aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott Thomas), with whom he lived, and his absent mother, Julia (Anne-Marie Duff), who came back into his life for the short period in the late 1950s covered by the film. The music and the meeting of the boys who became The Beatles take a back seat to this domestic drama. Even the early bonding of John with a more fresh-faced Paul (Thomas Sangster) is explained by the loss, in one way or another, of their respective mothers. When the only Lennon song in the film  Mother  plays over the closing credits, its a confirmation of the films chief theme: mums and the shadow they cast.<br />The two key performances come from Scott Thomas and Duff as the two women in Lennons life. Scott-Thomas plays Mimi as a prude whose attitude is born of protectiveness rather than instinct. Duff, meanwhile, pulls off the trick of being more likeable but less trustworthy. The most interesting element of the film is Taylor-Woods suggestion of a latent sexual chemistry between John and his mother, an idea that rather than feeling wild or gratuitous comes across as a sensible observation about a vulnerable but adventurous adolescent. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Goosebumps start to form about 30 seconds into the latest from Japans Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away, Howls Moving Castle). Were drawn under the waves of the sea to a hidden enclave of neon-hued aqualife more vibrant, surreal and enchanting than any of the floating 3D whatsits in Avatar. Miyazaki offers a spin on Hans Christian Andersens The Little Mermaid and subverts his source to explore the main theme of all his films: the unpredictable psychologies of kids separated from their parents. The film charts a key episode in the life of bowl-cutted scamp, Sosuke, and the sweet bond he forms with Ponyo, a squeaky-voiced goldfish-turned-human girl. Among the films pleasures are yet another heartbreaking evocation of the trials of childhood (particularly the complexity of forming friendships), a non-patronising depiction of old age and a trenchant yet subtle reminder of looming ecological catastrophes. Who knows why it didnt receive an Oscar nomination for Best Animation?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Filmed in 2006, German director Christian Alvarts first Hollywood feature  a dumb, glossy demon child movie with none of the subtlety of his debut, Antikrper  has languished on the shelf ever since. One can see why. A miscast Rene Zellweger plays social worker Emily Jenkins who, after saving ten-year-old Lilith (Jodelle Ferland) from being roasted alive in her mad parents oven, offers her a home. <br />At first, Emily thinks that Lilith is a classic damaged child, but then people start dying: one of Liliths classmates bludgeons his parents to death; Emilys boyfriend is killed by a swarm of hornets. Sceptical sheriff Mike Barron (a somnambulant Ian McShane) insists that a damaged, deceitful, manipulative child is not a demon, but by now Emilys do-gooder has pitched over into wild-eyed hysteria, raving about how Lilith is a malevolent catalyst who causes her victims to hallucinate their deepest, darkest fears. This is horror hokum of the cheesiest kind. Rent Orphan instead.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Anyone hoping that Peter Jackson may have returned to the more intimate territory of 1994s Heavenly Creatures for his version of Alice Sebolds novel must resign themselves to the fact that Jacksons filmmaking DNA may have become irreversibly modified. The source material might be more down to earth than King Kong, but Jackson does everything in his power to ditch the real in favour of fantasy.<br />The book was narrated from the grave by Susie Salmon (played by Saoirse Ronan in the film), a 14-year-old girl who is raped and murdered near her home. From a vantage point between heaven and earth, Susie follows her parents (Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz), her sister (Rose McIver) and her killer, Mr Harvey (Stanley Tucci), as she  and they  struggle to accept her fate. Not that we see anyone raped or murdered in this $100 million, 12A version: Jackson fatally softens the edges of the tragedy and its fallout.<br />The real let-down is the films reliance on overblown effects to represent Susies limbo. Coming across as if Dali was commissioned to paint Middle Earth for the New Zealand tourist board, the CGI scenes sideline the cast in favour of the magic of the animators hard drive. And it doesnt help that a gin-swigging Susan Sarandon plays Susies grandmother for comic effect just when you feel the film could do with some weight. And whos telling this story? It should be Susie, and at points she narrates. But theres no consistency.<br /><br />Is she a ghost? A narrator? A heroine? A victim? Her chocolate-box world suggests its a 14-year-olds view of life. Yet there are entire sections when we forget Susies all-seeing eye and dont know whether were in a drama, a thriller or a horror.<br />Watch this confused, unhappy film and weep a little for Lynne Ramsay (Ratcatcher), the British director who was first commissioned to write and direct it before it was swept away from her by higher powers.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hankies at the ready, folks. Bearing similarities to 2007s And When Did You Last See Your Father?, The Boys Are Back is a moving examination of father-son relations adapted from a memoir. Joe (Clive Owen) is a British sports journalist  the alter ego of The Independents Simon Carr, the original author  who is living in Australia and must renew his relationship with his six-year-old son Artie (Nicholas McAnulty) when his wife Katy (Laura Fraser) dies suddenly from cancer. <br />Still grieving, Joe takes a questionable and at times worrying laissez-faire approach to parenting (he calls it just say yes) as he tries to juggle work with child-rearing and at the same time maintain relations with a difficult mother-in-law and repair his bond with Harry (George MacKay), a teenage son from a previous marriage who breaks off his public-school education in Britain to come and stay with his father. The moment you think youre sorted is the moment it all starts falling apart, says Owens downbeat but sympathetic voiceover.<br />The material may sound sentimental, but director Scott Hicks (Shine) mostly avoids soppiness, even if hes not afraid to make the odd desperate plea for empathy, and a final-reel chapter in the UK is jarring in its need for easy resolution. Hicks is well served by an endearing Owen, whose performance must rank as one of his best, and some beautiful photography from rising Aussie Greig Fraser (Bright Star), whose landscape shots give us room to breathe away from domestic mayhem. Hickss directing style is straightforward and unfussy  a description you could apply to this big-hearted film as a whole.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Comedy]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[Up in the Air seeks comedy from two of Americas  indeed the Western worlds  most current fears: flying and redundancy. A tough ask, you might think, but director Jason Reitman offers an enjoyable balance of laughs and sorrows, pratfalls and body blows, even if this charming road movie (or should that be air movie?), adapted by Reitman and screenwriter Sheldon Turner from a 2001 novel by Walter Kirn, finally doesnt end up anywhere nearly as interesting or original as the enticing signposts suggest en route.<br />This is Reitmans third film after Thank You for Smoking and Juno, both of which were much less assured when it came to marrying social reality and laughs. George Clooney is Ryan Bingham, a bachelor and corporate lone gun who derives more pleasure from the 300-plus days a year he spends travelling around the country making people redundant than the 43 miserable ones he spends at home in a characterless apartment, out of step with the parochial glamour of his middle-rung executive lifestyle.<br />Bingham, played winningly straight by Clooney, is a rare airborne species whose entire existence is threatened when his company hires tight-faced, thrusting young graduate Natalie Keener (a fun Anna Kendrick) to reassess the companys operations. This preppy pipsqueaks big idea is to stop sending reps around the country and instead give clients employees their marching orders via a glorified version of Skype. Its an idea that falls sympathetically on credit-crunched managerial ears, although Binghams worried reaction reflects our conflicted response to the movie as a whole: half of him fears for those about to be sacked by satellite, while the other half fears losing a lifestyle that allows him to indulge in pleasures such as no-strings affairs with fellow travellers like Alex (Vera Farmiga), a good-time lady who implores him to think of me as yourself with a vagina. We might sympathise with those clearing their desks, but the threat of not being able to tag along with Clooney for the ride feels just as critical. Its an honest point: empathy only ever stretches so far.<br />For all its superficial topicality, Up in the Air mostly feels old-fashioned, nostalgic even, in its fond lament for a pre-9/11 world of travel. There are no security scares in this world. Its fetishisation of the rituals of flying is near-pornographic, with check-in girls substituting for bedfellows and frequent-flyer cards for sex toys. Binghams winning of millions of air miles come across as notches on his bed post. Hes the Warren Beatty of interstate business travel.<br />Its a pleasure to watch an adult American comedy that tries to deal with the real world, however much of a fantasy it carves from it. But the films later scenes as Bingham attends the wedding of a distant sister and has to face some ground-level realities about himself and his relationships are not as convincing or edifying as they should be and his sideline in motivational speaking never rings true as a symbol of his changing attitude to life. The films final announcement that even the most frequent flights of imagination have to touch down at some point is conventional and a little disappointing. But the journey is a riot while it lasts.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Read an interview with Scherfig here</i><br />This is Fish Tank for the suburbs: semis, not slums; safe, not sorry. Journalist Lynn Barbers spiky memoir of striking up a relationship with an older man in early 1960s west London has been turned into an accessible comedy romance by screenwriter Nick Hornby that seems designed to play extraordinarily well in the very same privet-lined streets it describes.<br />Its true that Barber, in her book, saw more absurdity than seediness in her youthful engagement to a criminal Jack the Lad at the same time as she was preparing to apply to Oxford from her Twickenham grammar school. But Hornby softens the edges further so that David (Peter Sarsgaard), her flashy suitor, is more charming than predatory, more vulnerable than cunning. The paedophile question is side-stepped entirely, even turned into a gag, and good-looking, redeemable Sarsgaard doesnt appear to be in his late thirties, as Barber assumes in her memoir, even if he claimed to be 27 to her 16. Hornbys script also makes too much of the peril of  God forbid  not getting into Oxford so that the film ends on an odd note that seeks false drama and resolution in Jenny being accepted or not at the university.<br />Luckily, Danish director Scherfig and star Mulligan give the film considerable weight by surrounding this lightly played, strange romance with both an acute understanding of Barbers endearing screen alter ego, Jenny (Mulligan), and incisive material about the differences between this know-it-all young lady and her less worldly mum (Cara Seymour) and dad (Alfred Molina), for whom wine is a Christmas treat and the French are the enemy across the water. Its through them that we see the first chink of light in the generation gap that would widen as the decade went on.<br />Theres a persistent comic tone which makes the light treatment of Jenny and Davids affair more palatable than it should be. This is provided partly by Molina and Seymour as the likeable, misguided parents, but partly by Rosamund Pikes brilliant empty-headed posh fluff, Helen, one of the early 1960s urban beau monde that includes Dominic Cooper as Helens louche boyfriend, who glides with David from nightclub to art auction to dog track with Jenny in tow.<br />As Jenny, Mulligan offers a great impression of Audrey Hepburn once she ties up her hair, throws off her school uniform and puts on an expensive, modish dress and jewellery. She is simply excellent in the role, the perfect mix of naivety and maturity beyond her characters years. She has a strong but down-to-earth beauty which alone does much to compensate for some of the films less convincing, broader moments.<br /><i>Read an interview with Scherfig here</i><br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Atom Egoyan only directs  not writes  this more slick, less subtle but still enjoyably barmy remake of Nathalie, the 2003 film which saw a middle-aged Parisian (Fanny Ardant) employ a hooker (Emmanuelle Bart) to seduce her philandering husband (Grard Depardieu) and report on the details. <br />There was something so French about the original (the implicit acceptance of adultery, for one) that its not surprising that the emphasis has changed so that the affairs of the husband (Liam Neeson) are less certain and more of a possibility that prompts the hiring of Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) by his wife (Julianne Moore). <br />But theres a literalism that disappoints: just when youre enjoying the suggestion that the entire set-up is reflective of the wifes turmoil or, at least, her mid-life crisis, the story takes a silly turn into stalker-thriller territory. Egoyans style is strictly arthouse-accessible: soft colours and dark shadows; modern architecture; a hint of erotica and the odd nipple shot.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Gathering his marbles (and any other weather-damaged, spring-loaded knick-knacks that may be in the vicinity) after the sepia-hued slushfest of A Very Long Engagement (2004), Frances master craftsman, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, returns with a comic potshot at the arms industry that makes for a hearty, if modest, return to form. <br />Firmly cleaving to his instantly distinguishable ersatz style in which cogs, pulleys and levers are tossed at the screen whenever possible, his story follows a band of oddballs as they administer a convoluted course of revenge on the tyrannical directors (Nicolas Mari and Andr Dussollier) of two rival weapons manufacturers. The catalyst for all this is the plight of body-popping video-store assistant Bazil (Dany Boon), whose father, we learn, is killed by a French-made landmine. To add injury to insult, Bazil is caught in the crossfire of a gun battle and gets a locally produced bullet lodged in his brain.<br />While its admirable that Jeunet has attempted to channel the mirth into a serious, unequivocally political statement, he does little to allow us to take his gestures seriously: its as if, say, Jacques Tati had chosen to make a film about the Rwandan genocide and insisted on keeping the silly hat. The point at which were supposed to see the funny side of extraordinary rendition is the glib gibe that pushes it over the edge. Yet, the film has its pleasures, namely the nimble, assured camera work and a script (written with regular Jeunet collaborator Guillaume Laurant) that constantly evokes the droll spirit of his hero, Jacques Prvert. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Towards the end of the Coen brothers The Big Lebowski, a black-clad German complains that a situation isnt fair. Fair? splutters Walter Sobchak (John Goodman). Whos the fucking nihilist around here?! Life isnt fair for the lead of the Coens latest, A Serious Man, either: Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a mild-mannered mathematics professor in 1967 suburban Jewish Minnesota, is struggling with a crumbling marriage, alienated kids, a burdensome brother, malicious professional rumours, a siren neighbour and incessant calls from a mail-order record company. Unlike the nihilists, however, Larry has faith: he is a conscientious Jew and tries to be a serious man. So, to quote a Jefferson Airplane song from the films soundtrack, when the truth is found to be lies and all the hope within you dies Then what?<br />Glanced at in many of the Coens earlier films, Jewishness is front and centre here, from the shtetl-set, Yiddish-speaking prologue to the hermetically Jewish community in which Larry lives. Drawing on the actual milieu of their own adolescence, the filmmakers  past masters of outr production design and sardonic genre subversion  play things relatively straight to tell a story that, for all its plentiful absurdities, is sincerely engaged with the challenge of unjust suffering. Bewildered, desperate, nose twitching in perplexity, Stuhlbargs Larry has been compared to Job; understandably, given his host of burdens and the settings Old Testament overtones. Yet Larry is perhaps closer to Kafkas Josef K, another put-upon character who suffers an unwarranted ordeal without quite being heroic.<br />The Coens nod at some familiar stylistic tropes  florid swearing, sexual euphemism, crusty, aged characters  but the films potency is rooted in quiet precision and detailed realisation. Roger Deakinss typically polished photography gives an oppressively hard edge to Midwestern suburbia while the sound design is a wondrous melange of soup-slurping, hacking coughs, gastric juices and ominous clanging. Stuhlbarg, a Tony-winning stage actor, leads a largely unknown but impeccable cast that also includes Sari Lennick as Larrys no-nonsense wife, Fred Melamed as her smug, unctuous lover and Richard Kind as Larrys sad-sack brother, forever draining a cyst on his neck.<br />Established religion offers Larry little consolation but the idea of faith, or at least good living, that emerges from his struggle matches the sensibility the Coens have unobtrusively espoused throughout their work: reject worldly status, bear trials with humility, find joy in fellow-feeling. Bad things happen to good people. To acknowledge  even, as storytellers, to embrace  this fact is not to indulge in nihilism, but to make more urgent the social task that might mitigate its effects. You better find somebody to love.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It was the death of Humbert Balsan, the original producer of young French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Lves first film, Tout Est Pardone, that inspired the character of Grgoire Canvel (Louis-Do de Lencquesaing), a handsome and cultured Parisian film producer with a beautiful wife (Chiara Caselli), three young children, an apartment in the city and a house in the country. <br />The superficial order and enviable comfort of Grgoires home life contrasts with the chaos of his film company, Moon Films, a struggling and passionate outfit where theres not enough money in the bank or time in the day to satisfy the interests of both the arthouse filmmakers they produce and a growing list of creditors.<br />Theres a sadness at the core of Hansen-Lves impressive and moving second film, but it feels wrong to call it a tragedy, so gentle is her humanism and so light is her touch as a storyteller, both of which recall Eric Rohmers non-period films. The story involves a number of surprising, emotional twists (some too important to reveal), but the 29-year-old directors brisk and breezy style is to avoid the melodramatic and move on, while planting feelings in our minds to consider at our leisure. <br />Its a method familiar from her first film, in which she moved freely between characters in one family and was interested in their secrets and the bonds between a teenage girl and her parents. Here, her insistence on giving as much attention to the filmmaking process as emotions feels awkward at points, but the essence of the film is a welcome compassion and curiosity about inner lives.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Playing like one of Steven Berkoffs theatrical pastiches of East End gangsterdom  with cod-Pinteresque cadences replacing Shakespeares  this profane, pretentious and seriously unfunny ordeal thriller reunites the writing team (Louis Mellis, David Scinto) and some of the stars (Ray Winstone, Ian McShane) of the far superior Sexy Beast. <br />A deliberately ambiguous opening  a slow pan around the devastated flat of supine villain Colin Diamond (Winstone) to the strains of Harry Nilssons Without You  is followed by the initially unexplained abduction of a young French waiter (Melvil Poupaud) from a Chelsea restaurant. The victim is then locked up in a wardrobe in an abandoned East End warehouse by a motley crew of caricatured hardmen  Diamonds geezers!  consisting of mothers boy Archie (Tom Wilkinson), confident, black-shirted gay Meredith (McShane), semi-psychopathic Mal (Stephen Dillane) and the viciously unreconstructed Old Man Peanut (John Hurt). <br />The stage is set  and what a claustrophobic, theatrical, two-room stage it is  for a day of taunting, vicious banter as the traumatised, volatile and hallucinatingly drunk Diamond arrives and his pals encourage him to exact fatal revenge on lover boy for, as flashbacks and dialogue reveal, his wifes (Joanne Whalley) infidelity. <br />Aiming for black comedy and a redemptive satire on self-deluding male machismo, ham fisted debut director Malcolm Venville instead gives his cast enough rope to hang themselves rather than the characters they play, with the exceptions of poor Poupaud, an almost wordless skeleton in a cupboard, and the unfortunate Winstone, who graces what is otherwise a deeply unedifying movie with one of the most raw, deeply felt but wasted performances of his career.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The journey from boyhood to manhood has inspired more great British films than just about any other topic, from David Leans Great Expectations through to Shane Meadowss Room for Romeo Brass, This Is England and Somers Town. The star of those last two, pug-faced Grimsby troublemaker Thomas Turgoose, returns in this bold debut by noted shorts director Tom Harper (Cubs): a film which manages to shed new light on this well-documented chapter in the human story.<br />Turgoose plays David, a taciturn teen whose life in a drab Norfolk caravan park is brightened by his friendship with mouthy, independent scrapper Emily (Holly Grainger). When her parents threaten to split them up, Holly takes drastic action and fakes her disappearance, hiding out in a nearby cave and choosing David as her only link with the outside world. But as their companionship develops  in Davids mind, at least  into something more serious, his emotional state becomes increasingly unstable.<br />Harper and screenwriter Jack Thornes triumph in The Scouting Book for Boys is to nail adolescent romantic obsession: that feeling of swooning desperation that comes with unrequited love. This is a film dripping with nostalgia  not the cheap, wistful kind, more a heartfelt but unsentimental longing for the moral clarity and emotional intensity of childhood, however painful it might have been at the time.<br />Fish Tank cinematographer Robbie Ryan repeats the remarkable trick he pulled off in that film by being simultaneously realistic and poetic, drenching the jagged contours and concrete structures of the English coastline in warm, honeyed light. The soundtrack is less succesful: Harpers largely acoustic song choices err towards the winsome  and occasionally the downright awful  which punctures the meticulously sustained, sun-kissed mood.<br />But a film about teenagers stands or falls on its performances, and here The Scouting Book for Boys succeeds admirably. Turgoose executes his customary balancing act between naturalism and outright performance, and its becoming increasingly hard to see the joins: his turn here is far more downbeat and restrained than were used to. Grainger is magnificent as Emily, switching from cold disdain to grasping helplessness in an eyeblink. Their relationship is beautifully developed and wholly believable.<br />Thorne and Harper take a series of perilous narrative risks in the final act, the perceived success or failure of which will depend on an audiences willingness to follow them into some surprisingly dark and challenging emotional territory. But even if some of his choices fail to convince completely, Harper has done enough with this striking, ambitious debut to herald the arrival of a major new filmmaking talent.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[David Bowerss fond retooling of Astro Boy, the seminal boy-bot creation of late Manga godhead Osamu Tezuka, is about as innocuous as family toons get. Set in the floating future world of Metro City, its the story of a young boy (Freddie Highmore) accidentally vaporised in an industrial accident, only to be rebuilt as a miniature robot gunship by his scientist father (Nicolas Cage). Donald Sutherland lends his voice to ultra-right-wing demagogue President Stone, who lusts for state-of-the-art firepower while spouting militarist buzzwords and allowing the audience to ally with the now-shunned Astro Boy and his new cadre of plucky outcasts. While far from an unmitigated disaster, Bowerss play-it-straight attitude towards the material combined with the crisp, if unspectacular, animation doesnt allow Astro Boy a moment to bob its head above the ever-swelling digimation pack. Though it may pass muster with the very wee ones.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The bands in Iranian director Bahman Ghobadis deceptively ramshackle snapshot of Tehrans underground music scene joke about the blood-drinking and devil worship of which theyre often accused. Which is funny, because these Converse kids look like they were raised on a steady diet of Dave Eggers and Devendra Banhart, not Satan and haemoglobin. Persian Cats is not a documentary but Ghobadi has said the script is 90 per cent real life and his actor/musicians seem pretty much to be playing themselves. Among them are Ashkan (Ashkan Koshanejad) and Negar (Negar Shaghaghi), a couple just out of prison and putting together an indie band to take to London.<br />All non-religious music is illegal in Iran, so its a crepuscular world of basement cellars into which the jittery camera follows them. Negar and Ashkan hook up with Nader, a wheeler-dealer (played hilariously Hamed Behdad), who promises to procure black market passports. He also takes them  and us  on a tour of Tehrans musicians, from Farsi rappers to traditional vocalists, to find band mates. There are some brilliantly funny scenes: a farmer moans that the metal band practising in a cowshed is putting his heifers off milking. There are some lovely murmurs too of the graceful expressiveness for which Ghobadi (Turtles Can Fly) is known: a gentle guitar teacher plays to a classroom of rapt five year olds. A few have criticised the music for being patchy, which it is. But thats mealy-mouthed considering the bravery and resistance of the musicians. The personal cost is realised in a sudden spasm of violence at the end, making this a full-throated plea for civil liberties. Incidentally, Ghobadi and his two leads have since had to leave Iran.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This debut from young Aboriginal Australian director Warwick Thornton, a cinematographer and veteran of short films and documentaries, is a near-silent, sun-bleached love story that plays out delicately between two teens living in a rundown community in the Australian desert. Barely a word is spoken between disaffected, petrol-sniffing Samson (Rowan McNamara) and wary, more sensible Delilah (Marissa Gibson) from start to finish; they communicate almost solely in looks and gestures. At first, its Samson who does all the chasing, but when Delilahs grandma (Mitjili Gibson) dies and the community blames her, she seeks companionship with Samson, who himself has fallen out violently with his brother. Together they steal a car and head to town, where they end up indulging in a worsening solvent habit that threatens to ruin their lives entirely.<br />Thornton is brilliant at capturing the isolation that marks these kids lives and inviting us into their bubble, a place where we come to see tenderness behind rough exteriors and understand the prejudices they face. The director plays a clever game with sympathy: he brings us closer and closer to Samson and Delilah but doesnt demand that we feel sorry for them. Its a smart approach that means we never feel manipulated, just guided by a sensitive and fearless commentator unafraid of revealing ugliness on all sides of the social divide  but who also believes that love can endure most hardships.]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[A Single Man]]></name>
      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[We tend to make a fuss of debutants. We celebrate their precocity. We excuse their naivety. But sometimes the word is misleading. Take Tom Ford. A Single Man is the 48 year olds first film, but can we really call a man who spent ten years as the creative director of Gucci a beginner? Couture is not cinema, but there are similarities. Both have a tendency to crush art with commerce. Both demand that an army of creatives  art directors, production designers, photographers and the rest  unite behind a vision that is sold ruthlessly to the public. So its worth remembering that Fords toolbag was already full to brimming when he embarked on his first film  though whether or not he knew how to use those tools is another thing entirely.<br />Christopher Isherwoods short 1964 novel A Single Man is a superb choice for a concise, intimate film. Its events are few, its emotional power is cumulative. The book visits one day in the life of George, a gay British expat and middle-aged literature teacher in 1962 Los Angeles. We learn gradually that George lost his younger partner, Jim, in a car crash and discover much later that this is a significant day for George, a slow reveal that gives the text a random, quotidian quality.<br />Ford turns the book on its head so that we know both these things from the start. But other than that, the books interior nature and sense of wandering remain in Fords delicate, moving film. We follow George (Colin Firth) closely, often alone, from morning to night. We watch as he gives a lesson on Aldous Huxley and join him on a drunken evening at the home of his soulmate and compatriot, Charlotte (Julianne Moore). Later, were with him during a late-night flirtation with a pupil, Kenny (Nicholas Hoult). And, in flashback, we see snapshots of his earlier, happier life with Jim (Matthew Goode).<br />As a director, Ford manages to exude both extreme confidence and first-time nerves. Only a beginner would decide that the best way to add structure to a near-perfect story is to insert a gun from almost the very first scene. But the control and precision with which Ford tells his story helps us to ignore this choice and still trust his vision, which falls off the screen with an intoxicating fluidity, helped by evocative editing of sound and image and an increasingly affecting score by Abel Korzeniowski. The film looks gorgeous. Young Spanish DoP Eduard Gran, a graduate of the National Film and Television School, shoots on an old 35mm stock that gives the images a soft precision. Almost all the film is colour, but the colours tell a story themselves: Ford manipulates the films brightness so that it glows and darkens depending on Georges mood. Rather than coming across as a gimmick, this serves the emotional ebb and flow of the book well and helps to turn the literary into the cinematic.<br />Maybe the film is too pristine. In this world, dust doesnt land, paint doesnt peel and grass doesnt grow. Georges black-and-white suit-and-tie combo is too perfect and his house is a modernist dream. His partner was an architect, were told. His director is a fashion designer, were thinking.<br />But nothing distracts from the empathy and understanding we have for George, and on that the film must live or die. Firths portrayal of a man repressing his grief while being unable to repress his instinct for love and for life is excellent and moving, while Fords balancing of depth and surface is precarious but ultimately winning. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>In our contemporary society, youth are pretty much lost, a musician says in<i> Until the Light Takes Us, </i>an exploration of Norways storied black-metal scene of the 1990s. People are telling them what to do, but the youth have an instinct telling them, This is wrong. Fair enough: Rebellion and boredom have long inspired potent rock. But the speakerVarg Vikernes, mastermind of seminal black-metal act Burzummakes his point from jail, where hes serving time for murdering a bandmate.</p><p>Largely forgoing the sensationalism of Michael Moynihans seminal black-metal tome, <i>Lords of Chaos</i> (look for a screen adaptation in 2010), Aaron Aites and Audrey Ewells plainspoken music doc relies on firsthand testimony from band members and key observers. Meanwhile, images of blazing churches and lurid tabloid headlines show how isolation and affected melancholy led to heinous crimes perpetrated by black-metal musicians, and on to a media-fueled frenzy.In addition to the unsettlingly charismatic Vikernes, Aites and Ewell focus on Darkthrone drummer Fenriz (Gylve Nagell), a diligent craftsman whose ghoulish pallor amounts to a blue collar. A big part of me wishes that this whole thing didnt turn into a trendthats what fucking sucked, and sucks still, Nagell says. Then again, wellpeople like to dress up.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>An Internet sensation since 2002, blogger and self-professed asshole Tucker Max has built a cottage industry documenting his drunken sexual conquests with women he has slightly less contempt for than those who dont succumb to his charms. With a dose of faux self-loathing and technicolorful epithets for the opposite sex, Max masks his misogyny by claiming hes a feminist, arguing that women have as much a right to screw whomever they choose. Hating him is part of the shtick, naturally, and his clever critic-proofing isnt lost on the producers of this painfully unfunny adaptation of Maxs online missives.</p><p>Beginning with the stalest of premisesthree buds and a bachelor partydirector Bob Gosse attempts to cash in on the vulgar bromance craze. But whereas the calculated narcissism of Tuckers onscreen alter ego (Czuchry) is an effective tool on his inebriated targets, such bad behavior will tax your tolerance level after five minutes. When the movie adds two sidekicks (Bradford, Stults) as comic-relief foils to Tuckers shenanigans, the toxicity simply triples. Worse, an attempt at redeeming itself with an all-it-takes-is-an-apology scene (noticeably absent from Maxs prose) leaves behind an even fouler stench than the films big fecal comic set piece.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Whip It is essentially Rollerball for the American Apparel set, where instead of James Caan battling fascist corporate powers youve got Ellen Page taking arms against crass feminine stereotypes. With her seductive and lightly anarchic directorial debut, Drew Barrymore strongarms her way into Austins underground roller-derby scene to tell the familiar tale of an underdogs rise to sporting eminence. The sport itself makes little sense to the casual onlooker (its female-only, full-contact and involves charging around an oval-shaped roller rink on skates and looking mean), but the film is saved by the sincerity of its tone and the richness and variety of its ensemble cast  from Juliette Lewiss hotshot banshee Iron Maven to Kristen Wiigs nurturing Maggie Mayhem and Barrymores borderline psychotic Smashley Simpson. And deftly moderating her patented eye-rolling poseur shtick, Page delivers her most charismatic and least divisive performance to date as Bliss Cavendar, aka Babe Ruthless.<br />Taken as a florid celebration of female solidarity, the film is commendable, if hardly radical. But in the final reel, following a sappy my-first-boyfriend subplot and much indie- rock name-dropping, the focus shifts to examine Blisss increasingly fractured relationship with her fusty parents and a more discerning and emotionally substantial film emerges. Marcia Gay Harden, as Blisss ex-beauty-queen mother, shimmers in the background, desperate for her daughter to realise her potential, but also quietly devastated at the prospect of losing her to the big bad world. Its a much needed oasis of quiet heartbreak amid the exhilarating cavalcade of sweaty roller girls.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ordinary-looking, middle-aged Krister (Olle Sarri) wakes on the bathroom floor, spattered with blood. He washes, dresses and goes to work. Hes irritable, out of sorts, yelling at his clients. The world around him is vague but intrusive  the lights too bright, the noise too loud. He goes to the gym, then drives home. The living room looks like a slaughterhouse.<br /><br />Jesper Ganslandts third feature is a work of psychological observation in the most literal sense: all we can do is watch. Theres no commentary, no judgment and precious little insight, so what were left with is a simple, near-real-time portrait of a taciturn, unreadable man trying to deal with the extremity of his existence. Sarri is phenomenal as Krister, an icy, utterly unpredictable blank canvas. Ganslandt directs with tremendous precision, creating a mood of brooding, implacable threat. But his refusal to dig any deeper into his character results in a compelling but finally (and perhaps intentionally) rather shallow portrait of human behaviour.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Austrian director Jessica Hausner, once a pupil of Michael Haneke (and credited on imdb.com, not very flatteringly, as script girl on Funny Games), takes her cameras to the French Pyrenean pilgrimage site of Lourdes for her third film, a mysterious, French-language ensemble piece about the role of miracles in the modern world. Hausners focus is on a youngish French woman, Christine (Sylvie Testud), one of a large group of pilgrims being shepherded around by Lourdess Order of Malta volunteers, a gang of young helpers dressed like fascists moonlighting as members of the St John Ambulance. But Hausner is wary of focusing too much on Christine, preferring to give equal billing to Lourdes itself and her wider group of pilgrims.<br /><br />The characters are scripted, but the places are real, and part of the films thrill, especially when coupled with Hausners often inscrutable attitude towards the place, is to watch her drama unfolding in such a location, both creepy and magical, dour and uplifting. Hausner has been given a privilege and she uses it wisely.<br /><br />Gradually, though, the drama tightens around Christine, whom we observe at closer quarters than the others. She is frail, pretty and blonde; shes also living with multiple sclerosis and is unable to move her body below the neck. Christines religious beliefs are unclear (I prefer the cultural trips, she says) but the pilgrimage is having a strange effect on her and soon shes the focus of everyones attention. Are we witnessing a miracle? Is Christine manipulating the situation? Is she really ill? And are we cruel even to entertain that last thought?<br />The beauty of Hausners film is that just when you think shes going to take a sneering swipe at Lourdes, its tacky trinkets and deluded visitors, the film takes a much less easy  and more inquiring  turn. Like Haneke, Hausner is more comfortable opening a debate than closing it. Some things are clear, though. Her photography is exquisite, evoking religious icons, and her mastery of directing such a group of actors at this exceptional location allows the film to maintain a strong ensemble feel while never losing sight of the mysterious story at its core. Theres also a delicious streak of black humour that runs through the film and stops it from becoming too pious or maudlin. The result is a provocative and surprising pleasure that may persuade even the most hardened rationalists to reconsider what religion means as a sanctity to those who have few other choices in life.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Big things were expected of German director Hans-Christian Schmid after he wowed critics in 2006 with astonishing demonic possession drama Requiem. Sadly, hes chosen to abandon much of what was great about that movie  the bracing, close-quarters photography, a virtuoso central performance  for this robust if inessential follow-up, a Euro-hopping legal thriller far more concerned with the legal than the thriller. Kerry Fox slinks into the role of a hard-nosed senior prosecutor out to bring a criminal Serbian general to justice. After a key witness commits suicide, his sister (played by Anamaria Marincas from 4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days) agrees to share her experience of the atrocities to a tribunal at the Hague. Storm is best when examining the emotional toil of the legal process, with Schmid and writing partner Bernd Lange offering a satisfyingly humane spin to the old story of moral obligation versus personal safety. The functional direction complements the austere material, but you cant help feeling the story needed something a little extra.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This slippery fish of a docu-essay, packed to the gills with stimulating archive footage, is at once fun and deadly serious. It uses the 1960s films and TV shows of Alfred Hitchcock as a starting point to explore the relationship between the Cold War and the big and small screens, between reality and fear, especially relating to American identity in the 1960s but with some nods to the present. The theme of doubles runs throughout: we meet a current Hitch lookalike and watch as Khrushchev squares up to Nixon. Theres also humour, not least in the chauvinist coffee ads which Grimonperez quotes, which helps to soften the rapid blow of ideas, some of which are clearer on a first viewing than others.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Mira Nairs biopic of legendary aviatrix Amelia Earhart (Hilary Swank, below) arrives on these shores the victim of a rather comprehensive kicking from the American critics, and its easy to see why. The film is hokey, wide-eyed and at times laughably unconvincing  and as such is an entirely fitting heir to the 30s Hollywood movies its clearly attempting to imitate. Not for Nair the fashionable, cynical revisionism of recent times: this is unashamed hagiography, a knowingly old-fashioned celebration of a heroic life.<br />Battling beneath the weight of a haystack haircut and the most terrifying gnashers this side of Jaws: The Revenge, Swank makes a decent fist of the title role, all brittle consonants and steely self-determination. In a surprising but highly appropriate upset, its Richard Gere and Ewan McGregor who take the thankless arm-candy roles, as book-tycoon hubby George Putnam and gadabout bit-on-the-side Gene Vidal, respectively. <br />The script, framed in a series of flashbacks as Amelia embarks on her doomed round-the-world flight, takes our heroine from plucky but inexperienced amateur pilot to icon of the Great Depression. Its a fascinating story, told simply but effectively: no ones working outside their comfort zone, but the film is never less than watchable and is often highly entertaining. Nair constructs the aerial sequences with real grace, and the entire enterprise has a lightness of touch that precludes any deep emotional involvement but also enables proceedings to tick along quite pleasurably. Inoffensive, arcane and ultimately rather sweet, Amelia is one to take your grandmother to.]]></review>

But when the credit crunch bites, mean-spirited Mr Thigo calls in his loan and gives Nick 24 hours to pay  or his mum gets it. With best mate Bing (Danny Dyer) in tow, Nick first tries to raise the readies legally but soon slips back into his old ways of intimidation and violence.<br />Partly financed by footballers Rio Ferdinand and Ashley Cole, this budget-conscious, simplistically plotted and often cringingly performed crime caper is not quite as inauspicious a producing debut as one might have expected. Granted, its message is contradictory  on one hand it drums home the old crime doesnt pay adage, while on the other it demonstrates exactly the opposite  but its lighthearted, comic tone proves relatively genial. And Blethyns a right laugh as the gaga mum with a mite more gumption than first meets the eye.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Theres a line from Jurassic Park that echoed hauntingly through this critics head as Avatar unfolded: Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they <i>could</i>, they didnt stop to think if they <i>should</i>. James Cameron is one of those scientists: so in love with the technology, with the possibilities, that he never pauses to reflect upon the practicalities of cinema, of storytelling, of connecting with an audience.<br />That quote is doubly relevant when one considers the cultural similarities between these two blockbusters, both of which justified massive expense by promising a quantum leap forward in visual effects. But where Spielberg utilised technology in the service of a tight, witty script, Cameron is simply out to astound. There are moments when you almost expect Sam Worthingtons moody, ever-present voiceover to be replaced by the self-styled king of the world yelling at his audience: Are you awestruck now? How about now? Now?<br />When his scientist brother is killed a week before shipping out to the distant planet Pandora, wheelchair-bound US Marine Jake Sully (Worthington) is offered the chance to go in his place. On Pandora, Jake meets his avatar, a remote-controlled host body generated from his brothers DNA and designed to blend in among the native Navi, a race of nine-foot blue hunter-gatherers living in peaceful harmony with their homeworld, Native American style.<br />Or rather, Native Californian: Navi civilisation is a mishmash of half-formed Hollywood ideas about the supposed superiority of primitive cultures, tossing around buzzwords like spirit and energy without ever approaching a cohesive set of beliefs. But all this tree-hugging shit, as Jake describes it, is only the most obvious defect in Camerons dire, clich-ridden script. From the bluntly expositional nature of the early scenes to the gung-ho, sub-Aliens banter of Jakes fellow soldiers, this is screenwriting on autopilot, cobbling together unripe ideas without a scrap of originality or emotional resonance. <br />Its hard to fault Avatar as an immersive visual experience. Pandora and its luridly coloured inhabitants are beautifully designed, though none of this ever feels remotely real. But this was  supposed to be the movie that changed the face of filmmaking forever. Ultimately, Camerons signature achievement may have been to prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the oldest of all Hollywood maxims: all the money in the world is no subsitute for fresh ideas and a solid script.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[We first meet Zac Efrons Richard, the me of Richard Linklaters charming new film about the insecurities and comradeship of actors, as a distracted, 17-year-old New York student, reading Nol Coward in class instead of Shakespeare. Its 1937 and Richard is a mildly cocky, slightly vain youngster who compares himself to a photo of John Gielgud on a book cover and tells a girl he meets in a jazz store that Im sort of an actor. Minutes later, he stumbles on some real actors gathered to rehearse Orson Welless Mercury Theatre production of Julius Caesar and lays down some chat about playing the ukulele. Next thing, hes got a bit part. Weekly pay: zilch. Kids got balls, mutters Welles (Christian McKay), a cigar between his teeth. Let rehearsals begin<br />Robert Kaplows source novel and Linklaters sprightly adaptation sprinkle a little fiction on Welless very real, radical staging of Julius Caesar and offer a sideways view of one of the most precocious, flawed talents of the twentieth century. In 1937, Welles was just 22, pre-War of the Worlds, pre-Citizen Kane, but already a darling of the New York theatre scene and able to wrest art from chaos on a wing and a prayer. Efrons Richard  played with an attractive, puckish energy and loosely based on a real character  is a window on Welless world at just enough of a distance from the great man that the directors loud personality doesnt dominate. All roads lead to Welles, but we also witness a brief affair between Richard and Mercury staffer Sonja Jones (Claire Danes), during which Richard learns that the public and the private are one and the same in this theatrical hothouse. Even the loss of his virginity infringes on Welless mantra: There is one simple rule: I own the store!<br />McKays turn as Welles is hugely enjoyable, the right mix of extreme confidence and a dash of vulnerability. Physically and vocally, hes very convincing: his Welles is a bullish presence among his actors but he also displays cracks in the great mans armour: he whispers a sincere thank you to his producer (Eddie Marsan) and tells Richard how hes adapting The Magnificent Ambersons for radio: Ambersons is about how everything gets taken away from you, he says, a reminder that Welles lost both parents by the time he was 15. <br />Whats most admirable about Linklaters production is that it never loses sight of the play at its heart. The crescendo is not a romance or any other distraction, but the outcome of rehearsals during which we and the cast believe a disaster is pending. Theres a strong ensemble flavour, characterised by the simultaneously selfish and clubbable tendencies of the actors, which makes for a lightly comic experience but also for a portrait of a theatre company that feels warm and true.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When astronaut Chuck Baker lands on Planet 51, hes shocked to discover its inhabited by green locust-like people who live in futuristic homes as envisaged by sci-fi writers of the 1950s. Fearing an invasion of post-Columbus proportions, the locals call on arrogant General Crawl to amass his anti-alien brigade. Only one character, a kid called Lom , is prepared to help Chuck evade capture. Planet 51 posits notions of colonialism, cultural division and xenophobia to unremarkable effect. Its also one hell of a magpie movie  thats to say it comes over as a mix of ideas, characters, designs and scenes that recall Shrek (hardly surprising given that the film is penned by Shrek writer Joe Stillman), The Cat in the Hat, Toy Story, Alien, Star Wars and ET. This below-par sci-fi animation is no threat to the similarly themed and infinitely superior Battle for Terra (released February 12), but theres enough of a storyline here to keep younger space cadets moderately settled.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In this three-dimensional, computer-generated age, new studio chief John Lasseters desire to take Disney animation back to basics seems a risky proposition. But whats surprising about The Princess and the Frog is just how far back theyve gone: this isnt The Lion King or even The Jungle Book: with its sensuous, hand-drawn animation, soft pastel palette and jazz-age setting, this is an exercise in retro recreation as rigorous and rewarding as Far from Heaven.<br /> The plot is thin but fun, following the adventures of a poor New Orleans waitress with big dreams and a haughty prince of indeterminate foreign stock after theyre transformed into amphibians and marooned in the Louisiana bayou. Randy Newmans songs are a little too blandly Randy Newman-ish and the story is uneven, but there are some great characters, some even better jokes, a general sense of good humour and that entrancing, eye-ravishing old-school animation.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its a true story: rich southern white folks take in a black teenager, then help him towards college football and a big-time NFL contract. In the right hands, this could be about simple kindness overcoming mutual suspicion and bridging social divides  a story questioning an America where it takes such charity to effect genuine social mobility. This is certainly not that movie. Instead it resembles one of those formatted TV reality shows where the top-billed female personality uses her bossy common sense to tame recalcitrant kiddies/ animals so their parents/owners can be proud of them.<br /><br />Quite how Sandra Bullock deserved an Oscar for her one-note turn as bleached supermum Leigh-Anne is a mystery, since it transforms a potentially worthwhile character study into a grandstanding star vehicle. Her comic timing is just-so and she invests the homespun one-liners with a veneer of sincerity, but theres no way this is a real person. Its Sandra Bullock doing her thing.<br />On the other hand, Michael (Quinton Aaron), the troubled outcast to whom she gives a stable home the rest of her family know better than to argue with Leigh-Anne  is hard to read, beyond gentle giant cultural clichs. Meanwhile, director John Hancock shows us enough of the lads scary, hope-free ghetto background to tell us we dont want to go there. He lends the proceedings a patina of class and a certain entertainment value, yet the whole approach (in marked contrast to, say, Precious) is about putting white middle-class compassion proudly centre-stage. A half-truth, a half-story, surely?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Taking into account films like Patch Adams, RV and License to Wed, Robin Williamss acting CV now has more bizarre blotches on it than an abstract expressionist canvas. Even so, Old Dogs is a special kind of bad. Here he plays a vile corporate shitbag who is charged with the unspeakable task of caring for his own children (the result of a drunken fling in Miami) for two whole weeks. With John Travolta worming in as his long-time business partner and best bud, this wanton set-up exists solely as an excuse for a lame-brained cavalcade of feebly executed, deeply unfunny and casually offensive skits in which the two prance around, wave their hands in the air and make asses out of themselves. Its hard to pinpoint the exact nadir. Perhaps its when Travolta starts shovelling rhubarb pie over his face? Or what about when the pair unwittingly wander into the silverback enclosure at a zoo? Or maybe its when Williams is trapped in a tanning booth and then gets mistaken for an Asian man? Whatever, this is imbecilic hooey of the rarest breed.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Given that Alvin and chums originally started out in 1958 as a trio of high-pitched recording artists, its only right that this live-action squeakquel should begin with the furry little CG blighters wooing a concert crowd with a raucous Kinks cover. Unfortunately, its the films only highlight  if the sight of three annoying furballs murdering You Really Got Me can be considered a highlight.<br />Id like to think the filmmakers had a lengthy deliberation about a storyline, but I suspect they simply caught an episode of The X Factor and the recently released Bandslam and thought a premise involving a self-centred Alvin, a rival group of female chipmunks (The Chipettes) and a college talent contest would prove a mighty good wheeze. And, indeed, that might have been the case had the story any semblance of a story. Instead, what were offered is a succession of lifeless scenes punctuated by pratfalls that only a handful of kids in the audience found funny. Next.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Russia, 1910. In his old age, Leo Tolstoy has become so famous worldwide that the merest hint hes about to pop his clogs sends newsreel cameras gathering in anticipation. The real story though, as this slightly fusty drama elaborates, is unfolding inside the Tolstoy household, where the octogenerian writer (Christopher Plummer, authentically beardy) finds himself in the centre of a dispute over the valuable publishing rights to War and Peace. The Tolstoyan political movement  an organisation espousing his ideas on communal property to combat social injustice  sense a major funding opportunity should Tolstoy sign his best-known book over to their leader Chertkov (Paul Giamatti), yet Tolstoys aristocratic wife Sofya (Helen Mirren), having delivered him 13 children, is determined to fight her corner to the bitter end.<br />Idealism versus family ties makes for a potentially juicy set-to, yet its the historical detail which keeps this adaptation of Jay Parinis novel relatively intriguing, rather than merely stodgy. Writer-director Michael Hoffman is all reverence towards Tolstoy himself, but curiously supercilious towards the beliefs of the Tolstoyan movement, thus undermining the key subplot (eager young acolyte James McAvoy gets his dream job as the great mans secretary, but must also spy on him) and unfairly loading the central conflict in favour of ferocious spouse Mirren. Her impressively projected performance becomes the dominating factor, causing Plummer to overdo it, and sidelining both the earnestly wet McAvoy and moustache-twirling Giamatti. Engaging performers all, but the movies superficial flummery is slightly exasperating when the true-life events would have provided an even richer palette of ideas.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[He turns 80 this year and claims Gran Torino was his last outing as an actor. But, as a director, Clint Eastwood is keeping his nose to the grindstone. He spent the end of 2009 filming a Peter Morgan-penned thriller, Hereafter, in Europe and the US, and earlier last year decamped to South Africa to film this respectful, rousing drama about Nelson Mandelas canny co-opting of the 1995 Rubgy World Cup Finals as a tool to promote racial harmony across the social and political tinderbox that was the new, post-apartheid state.<br /><br />Eastwood isnt a director to indulge in shades of grey and so the films first scenes of the historic, televised release of Mandela (Morgan Freeman) from prison in 1990 are preceded by a shot of white boys playing rugby on one side of the road while their black equivalents kick a football on the other. Simple imagery: a background of division established  job done.<br />A similar, no-nonsense efficiency colours the whole film, which jumps forward to Mandelas inauguration in 1994, again mixing reconstruction and news footage, before ditching this early documentary feel to settle into a behind-the-scenes walk-through of the early months of his presidency. This was a time when existing presidential staff wrongly expected to be booted out of their jobs; a black civil-rights group believed, also wrongly, that Mandela would support their desire to change the name and colours of the national rugby team; and somewhere in a white suburb the captain of that same team, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) and his family were shaking their heads at the assumption that their country was heading to the dogs.<br />Eastwood and writer Anthony Peckham further stress South Africas lingering disharmony through a chorus of Mandelas bodyguards, for which existing, white heavies are joined by new, black counterparts. Between them, they trade insults and glares like boxers before a fight. Again, its a simple tool, useful enough but marred by some substandard local actors. All praise to Eastwood for casting on the ground; less praise to him for allowing them to disrupt his movie with their awkward presence.<br />From here, its valuable life lessons all round as Mandela invites Pienaar to tea, joins the rugby team in training and  famously  strides on to the pitch at the South Africa v New Zealand final wearing the same Springboks shirt that a year earlier was a divisive symbol of the old nation. Security tensions at this match offer Eastwood an unnecessary sideshow as he tries and fails to insert a thriller element into the film by hinting at a bomb attack or assassination attempt  real fears at the time, but out of place here. A shot of an aircraft flying above the stadium plays on post-9/11 fears  but would anyone in 1995 have suspected a low-flying passenger plane of terrorism?<br />Both leads are effective, and Damon is very good at displaying Pienaars conservatism cracking in the glare of Mandelas wise optimism. Freeman is perhaps too stately, but its a thankless task trying to pull off an impersonation of such a public figure. Hes more at ease in intimate scenes, although on a technical level, his accent raises the odd eyebrow.<br />Invictus isnt one of Eastwoods best films, especially judged against the late flowering of his career since 2003s Mystic River. But its still a noble and compassionate work that in its later scenes manages successfully to invest our emotions in the triumph of an important  if overlong!  sporting victory. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[City slickers find themselves marooned in Hicksville USA in this ultra-mild frolic which follows the fish-out-of-water comedy formula so closely its lack of surprise is almost, well, surprising. The Morgans are boutique estate agent Meryl (Sarah Jessica Parker) and swanky expat English lawyer Paul (Hugh Grant) and their marriage is in trouble  fertility issues, infidelity (his) and so on. However, as plot contrivance would have it, on their night out to patch things up, they see one of her wealthy clients being bumped off, and soon, to protect them from the killer at large, they find themselves spirited away to darkest Wyoming. Together  gulp! Without their mobiles  horror!<br />Were supposed to care whether they do actually remain together, but there are distractions, like wondering whether SJPs somewhat amorphous skin tone means shes actually been replaced by a CGI avatar of herself. Or quite why Grant, who hustles awfully hard with material youd hardly call fluff, keeps working with writer-director Marc Lawrence  he who brought us Two Weeks Notice and Music &amp; Lyrics, the celluloid equivalent of microwaveable ready meals. Theres a kind of functional professionalism which keeps things burbling along painlessly enough, but its an experience more fitting to a flu-ish afternoon on the sofa or long-haul in economy, when were at our least demanding. Rootin, tootin cowboy folk Sam Elliott and Mary Steenburgen add some downhome charm, but from the moment we see posters warning of grizzly attacks in the area, a rampaging bear cant arrive soon enough.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Older people have sex too! Thats the message of Its Complicated, the second geronto-com from Nancy Meyers. While 2003s Somethings Gotta Give featured an angsty, flustered Diane Keaton and a womanising Jack Nicholson, this stars a slightly less angsty Meryl Streep, who is flustered by her encounter with serial womaniser Alec Baldwin.<br />The complication is that Jane (Streep) was married to Jake (Baldwin)  but he left her and their kids for other woman Agness (Lake Bell). Now Jakes on a nostalgia trip, sweet-talking his independent ex into bed and a whole world of confusion. This may sound like unforgivably caddish behaviour, but script and actor conspire to make Jake an attractive proposition, with Baldwins charismatic arrogance and playful banter in full effect. <br />Baldwin has terrific chemistry with Streep: the pair seem to be having a genuinely hilarious time getting drunk and naked together  not that Jane will do that with the lights on. The script explores female insecurities and doesnt shy away from the realities of middle-aged sex: Jake proudly displays his hairy beer belly on several occasions.<br />You could watch this pair run around having a slapstick secret affair for hours. Unfortunately, Steve Martin has to poke his head in as the Sensible Alternative, and hes miscast. Martin is fine in comic scenes, but as a romantic possibility hes unappealing. The inevitable conflict between the two men takes the film into more humdrum, sentimental territory, not helped by periodic appearances from Janes soppy grown-up children. Still, Streep is as enjoyable as ever, and if laughs count for anything, this is one of the better romantic comedies of the season.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its surely no coincidence that when Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), the comic-book-reading New York teenager who decides to buy a coloured wetsuit and become the superhero of the title, winds up in hospital after his first outing as a vigilante, he reads Watchmen. Like that story, the series by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr, on which Kick-Ass is based is a comic about comics, presuming a substantial knowledge of the icons and conventions of the superhero genre. Its an index of how successfully that genre has established itself in the Hollywood mainstream over the past decade that such postmodern, self-referential fare is now deemed apt fodder for major studio releases.<br /><br />Puzzled that no one has ever tried to put comic-book theory into practice, Dave hits the streets in the name of righteousness, overcoming early setbacks to achieve hero status with a little help from MySpace and YouTube. He also attracts the attention of father-and-daughter vigilante team Big Daddy and Hit Girl (Nicolas Cage and Chlo Moretz) and arouses the enmity of crime lord Frank DAmico (Mark Strong), whose son (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) sees a chance to dabble in the hero game himself.<br />Director Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Stardust) directs with efficiency and a good sense of action while Johnson puts in an engaging turn that maintains sympathy and helps paper over some of the plots more jerky, episodic aspects. Wearing its sources on its Spandex sleeve, Kick-Ass fairly bulges with references to other comic-book movies, especially the Spider-Man and Batman franchises; Cages stilted delivery as the Dark Knightish Daddy is a nice touch. Theres some intriguing play around ideas of closetedness  a perennial concern of the genre  with Daves secret life leading classmates to presume hes gay. Other conventions are touched upon but left unexplored: while it is constructed around three father-child pairings, for instance, the film leaves Daves single dad a cipher.<br /><br />The bond between pre-teen Hit Girl and her Big Daddy, meanwhile, is as intense as it is outrageously violent, rooted in such affectionate larks as his shooting her at close range to familiarise her with the use of bullet-proof vests. The duo are responsible for many of the pictures numerous fatalities, shown in more detail and with more gusto than in most superhero films (or most 15-rated films, for that matter). The sight of Hit Girl slicing and dicing half a dozen thugs to the accompaniment of the Banana Splits theme tune locates Kick-Ass in the post-Tarantino landscape of hyperfictional ultraviolence. Any gestures at a version of realism or the pathos that might result from someone actually trying to be a superhero are lost in the wash.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[After a fine start to the decade with 24 Hour Party People, the British music film has become an increasingly drab prospect. Sanitised, reverential biopics like Control and Nowhere Boy have reduced our most vital rock legends to overanalysed everymen, robbing them of power and mystery in an effort to understand them  a pointless and impossible task best left to the cultural scholars.<br />But Road to Guantanamo director Mat Whitecross is having none of it. Tackling the rise and fall of bolshy proto-punk gobshite Ian Dury, Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll is a riot of clattering noise and kaleidoscopic colour, off-kilter imagery and foul language, all the good things the title promises and much more. Taking his cue not just from former collaborator Michael Winterbottoms celebrated Factory expos but from Todd Hayness ramshackle, revisionist rock n roll masterpieces, Velvet Goldmine and Im Not There, Whitecross presents Dury as a verbally abusive, dishonest, thoroughly disreputable but endlessly fascinating lyrical genius, exploring his past in a way that informs  but never seeks to explain  his present.<br />That present is the mid-70s, the period in which Dury (Andy Serkis) split from his old band Kilburn And The High Roads  and from long-suffering spouse Betty (Olivia Williams)  to form the Blockheads, with whom he would achieve stellar homegrown success. Taking up with teenage tearaway Denise (Naomie Harris), Dury attempts to juggle the demands of family, fame and mounting alcoholism, but always ends up putting his own needs first.<br />Its this refusal to sugarcoat Durys shortcomings that really impresses: yes, Whitecross and screenwriter Paul Viragh ask us to empathise with their self-pitying, class-obsessed, emotionally and physically crippled hero, but they never expect us to forgive his excesses. Serkiss performance is remarkable, alternating between Gollum-esque bug-eyed lunacy and a more subtle, heartfelt portrait of a life in turmoil. <br />A scene in which Dury revisits the hospital where he spent his childhood, coming face to face with a new generation of angry young outcasts, is quietly heartbreaking: sentimental, perhaps, but entirely schmaltz-free. Similarly, the central relationship between Dury and twitchy pre-teen son Baxter (a superb Bill Milner) does a great job of outlining the unpredictable lows and (often literal) highs of having a deadbeat pop star for a father. You dont need to be a fan of Durys music to enjoy Sex &amp; Drugs. This is just gorgeous, celebratory cinema, unfettered and courageous, if unashamedly scattershot, much like the man himself. Forget young Lennon and his tedious Oedipal angst  this is the one by which a new decade of music movies will be judged.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Discerning Bollywood fans are in for a treat: a comedy we can laugh with rather than at. Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Joshi) embark on a road trip to Ladakh, in the Himalayas, to track down long-lost buddy Rancho (Khan). The latter is introduced via lengthy flashbacks detailing the antics of the three idiots during their college engineering days. But why did Rancho disappear mysteriously after graduating? The films main strength lies in its ability to address head-on the possible failure of higher education in contemporary India. This is conveyed via Hiranis trademark light-hearted touch. Consequently, the clichd make your passion your profession premise never feels preachy. Overlong, this quirky well-acted film proves, as the title track says, that generally all is well with commercial Hindi cinema.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[Movies about country musicians tend to go one of two ways. First, there are those inspired by true events, films like Coal Miners Daughteror Walk the Line, which explore the rise of a legend: all one-room shacks, abusive parents and acres of gingham. Then there are stories inspired by the songs themselves: tales of hardship and loss, redemption and self-discovery, saloon bars, acoustic guitars and gallons of sippin whisky.<br />Crazy Heart falls squarely into the latter bunch. Jeff Bridges plays Bad Blake, a one-time Nashville big hitter reduced to touring Midwestern dives picking up loose change and loose women, his livelihood in even worse shape than his liver. That is, until two events conspire to turn his sinking ship around: a relationship with Maggie Gyllenhaals Jean promises the kind of unflinching affection and familial grounding Blake badly needs, and a gig writing songs for one-time protg-turned-megastar Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) provides a much-needed jolt for his career.<br />In purely story terms this is by-the-numbers stuff, ticking all the expected boxes about redemption and renewal. But writer-director Scott Coopers trick is to turn that predictability into a strength: like a song youve heard a thousand times but which never fails to tug the heartstrings, Crazy Heart feels familiar, even comforting, offering few surprises but a wealth of lovingly crafted, immaculately judged, wholly authentic emotion.<br />The emotion is there in the soundtrack put together by Cooper and producing legend T-Bone Burnett, with new songs by Burnett and Ryan Bingham sitting perfectly alongside obvious inspirations like Townes van Zandt and Waylon Jennings. Its also in Coopers solid direction: despite his inexperience, he never falls prey to flashy first-time director syndrome, confident that his screenplay and cast will carry him through.<br />And its in those remarkable central performances: Bridges has already earned an Oscar nomination, but its impossible to overstate how much his honest, unabashed performance  part The Dude, part Kris Kristofferson  grounds the film. Hes backed by a sympathetic Gyllenhaal, making magic from a potentially thankless role, and a convincing turn from Farrell as the preening bigshot in cowboy clothes. But best of all is Robert Duvall, who essentially defined the subgenre with Tender Mercies back in 1983, and whose quiet, deeply felt turn as a bar owner reminds us of his undimmed but underused talent.<br />A shame, then, that the movie falls at the final hurdle with a series of crude, convenient feelgood twists, leading to an abrupt, unconvincing finale. If Cooper and his cast hadnt done their work so well, hadnt made us care so deeply for these fractured souls, maybe it wouldnt matter. As it is, Crazy Heart is only two-thirds a great movie: but like the song says, that aint bad.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Tim Burtons part-live action, part-animated, all-3D version of Alice in Wonderland is a collage of characters and episodes from Lewis Carrolls two nineteenth-century books about a girl who falls into the rabbit hole of her own imagination. But purists beware: Burton and his writer, Disney regular Linda Woolverton (The Lion King), invent a quest narrative  Alice must slay the Jabberwocky!  that climaxes in a pedestrian battle for which Alice puts aside dresses and channels Joan of Arc. Moreover, our heroines loopy headtrip begins with her fleeing a very public marriage proposal with the twenty-first-century excuse, I need a moment<br />This is a loose, enjoyable and safe spin on the books, with familiar characters doing familiar things within the altered  and digitised  framework of an older Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returning underground to find the Red Queen (a fun Helena Bonham Carter, actually playing a conflation of the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts) ruling a depressed land. <br />The problem with this downtrodden version of Wonderland is that it doesnt always sit well with the mania of Carrolls creations, and when we see a brighter flashback of the Red Queen painting roses, we wish we were in that world. Imagine the Cheshire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), the wise Caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman) and the Mad Hatter (an underwhelming, repetitive Johnny Depp) all doing their thing in the forests of Avatars Pandora after a long bout of acid rain and you begin to get the picture. Much of the colour has been sucked out and replaced with dark skies and long faces.<br />Yet much of Carrolls magical nonsense remains, even if Burtons film wobbles at the gates of anarchy and ends up being a more average affair than many might expect. Its also one in which the inventive costumes and individual flights of animated fancy end up being more memorable than the thin characters and half-hearted 3D rendering. As its Burton at the helm, you could call it gothic. The less generous might just call it gloomy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Trans-Atlantic romantic comedies often reach for easy stereotypes, but few have managed to be as patronising as Leap Year, in which superficial Bostonian Anna (Amy Adams) totters over to Ireland for a love-hate relationship with beardy, muttering Irishman, Declan <br />(Matthew Goode). <br />The plot centres on the idea of a woman proposing on February 29  an Old Irish Tradition, we are told 500 times, as if wed never heard of it. Anxious for a rock on her finger, Anna flies to Ireland to propose to her boyfriend Jeremy (Adam Scott), whos working in Dublin. Re-routed because of bad weather, she must squeeze her designer luggage into the banger driven by Declan, and question her heart when he turns out not to be a complete Neanderthal. <br />While theres some chemistry between the pair, its not enough to compensate for their paper-thin characters, never mind all the crosseyed Guinness-swilling extras and the endless winding country roads that supposedly lead to Dublin. Adams does her level best, but her perkiness quickly wears as thin as her spiky heels on those pesky rural roads.]]></review>

Jackie Chan should get some applause for his appropriation of child actors in The Spy Next Door (watch the kid fly!). Actually his goofy, slapstick stunts  devised with his personal team  are perfect for children and pretty good fun. As for the rest, this is a lazy spin on the action-veteran-left-holding-the-baby wheeze (Kindergarten Cop, The Pacifier). Chan is the nerdy guy next door, who is dating the little horrors mother. But really hes a Chinese agent on loan to the CIA. Theres also a Russian oligarch on his tail, with a dastardly plan to destroy the worlds oil reserves, assisted by a clutch of henchmen and the requisite foxy villainess. It comes with the usual kids stuff: wedgies for the boys, adorably skittish pets for the girls. Even the outtakes barely raise a smile. The best of them sees Chan fluffing his lines: I hate English, he mumbles. Who can blame him when its as grindingly predictable as this?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This is the directorial debut of visual effects specialist Scott Stewart, who describes his film as a character-driven action-thriller with supernatural themes, which ignores its over-arching religious angle. Back in 1995, Gregory Widens The Prophecy cast Christopher Walken as the renegade Archangel Gabriel; Stewarts jokier, messier take on The End of Days has similar, high-flown ideas, but nothing serious with which to back them up. <br />This time, its the Archangel Michael (Paul Bettany) whos gone rogue. Tired of humanitys capacity for self-destruction, God has lost patience with those he made in his own image and the harbingers of the apocalypse  storm clouds, swarms of flying insects, a crazy old lady who spews obscenities and walks on the ceiling, a demonic ice-cream man  have reached an isolated diner in the Mojave Desert. <br />Its here that the fate of mankind will be decided, as conflicted Michael tries to protect the unborn child of unmarried waitress Charlie (Adrianne Palicki) from time-serving Gabriel (Kevin Durand), who has come to do Gods bidding. Meanwhile, sundry minor characters are given nothing to do, besides explaining their tedious backstories to one another. <br />Eventually, just when it seems that we have entered a purgatorial limbo where time stands still, it becomes apparent that director Stewarts way of wrestling with big metaphysical themes is to have the Archangels Michael and Gabriel beat the shit out of each other. So we get a punch-up between the lick-spittle Gabriel, armed with a CGI-enhanced mace, and the rebellious Michael, armed with a profound sense of moral righteousness. Celestial tosh of less than Biblical proportions.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[According to this new Disney comedy, the daily grind of a tooth fairy is weirdly similar to that of Father Christmas, as seen in 1994s The Santa Clause. It involves lots of lying to your family, a bit of self-discovery and a lot of pratfalling and wailing like a loon. Dwayne The Rock Johnson treads water as Derek, an ageing hockey star slumming in the lower leagues after an injury whose trick is to come on at the end of the game and smash his opponents teeth in, hence the nickname Tooth Fairy. Living as a bachelor but making solid ground with a divorcee played by Ashley Judd, Derek is charged with two weeks actual tooth-fairy duty after he selfishly reveals to his girlfriends daughter how the money really ends up under the pillow. Apart from being poorly constructed and only mildly amusing, the film suggests that a child would rather believe that the whole tooth-fairy operation is run from a ruthless mercantile trading floor in the sky than merely be consoled by the possibility that it all just happens. Everything about the film feels like the product of a calculating mind, right down to the bit where Judds teenage son makes the bizarre proclamation that its his dream to scale the epic rock-star heights of Eric Clapton, or failing that, Stevie Ray Vaughan. The one element that lifts this above utter tedium is the presence of Stephen Merchant as tooth-fairy administrator Tracy. That he manages to come away with his dignity intact is testament to his skill as a comedian.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Following a disastrous incursion into bubblegum high-school romance territory (I Love You, Beth Cooper), Chris Columbus, director of the first two Harry Potters, returns to his comfort zone for this episodic and mirthless fantasy saga based on the first of a series of fantasy books by US writer Rick Riordan.<br />Mulching together the angsty teen intrigue of Harry Potter and the frigid-and-proud flagwaving of Twilight, the film sees Zac Efron lookalike Logan Lerman (Gamer) playing an underachiever who turns out to be a sword-swinging demigod when he discovers his birth was the result of the god Poseidon (Kevin McKidd) having a quick fling with dowdy New York housewife Catherine Keener. When his mother is kidnapped by Hades (Steve Coogan in full Saxondale mode) as a bargaining chip for Zeuss lost lightning bolt, Percy is charged with finding a number of trinkets dotted across North America in order to avert a crisis on Mount Olympus (located just above the New York cloud cover, who knew?) and save mom from eternal damnation. <br />That Percy risks life and limb to preserve the family unit is typical Columbus, and the film works best when playing on the idea that no amount of bravado is enough to mask our desire for parental love. Yet its not enough to compensate for the computer-game-style plotting, which is largely based on us picking up narrative nuggets that mechanically slot into place later on. Problematic, too, is the product placement: witness the scene in which Percy battles Medusa (Uma Thurman) and avoids her deathly gaze by craftily using the shiny back of his iPod as a mirror.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Foxs foray into Bollywood examines the fallout of 9/11 on NRIs (Non Resident Indians) in Bushs America. Khan (Shah Rukh Khan), a Muslim man with Aspergers syndrome, travels across the USA in order to meet the President. My Name is Khan; I am not a terrorist is his mantra. Karan Johar, Bollywoods biggest director, admirably addresses a sensitive topical issue within the widest commercial context. He incorporates marital strife, communal conflict, racism, bullying, a mamma subplot, and a catchy soundtrack (frustratingly not subtitled) to convey his progressive agenda. The result is a film of tonal inconsistency which reflects its simplistic good people/bad people view of human nature. Technically accomplished, its always engaging due to the credible performances from its beautiful leads, the charismatic Khan and Kajol. Worthy, but flawed.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[His playbook may be a bit unorthodox but he gets things done! The most recycled snippet of dialogue in the maverick-cop genre is rolled out to honour the dubious methods of lead-sheddin, gack-snorting FBI wildman, Charlie Wax (John Travolta). Looking like Fu-Manchu in surplus combat gear and not so much chewing the scenery as using it for target practice, hes teamed with preppy, pencil-pushing office bod James Reece (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) to take down a Parisian drug cartel as quickly and violently as possible. <br />With the story swiftly descending into a series of spuriously linked encounters in which the pair find themselves terrorised by many different ethnic minorities, the film is best when examining the unexpected chemistry between its unlikely leads. Cinematographer-turned-director Pierre Morel (Taken) composes the action sequences with the balletic sheen of Hong Kong-era John Woo, but its not enough to allow the film to rise above its guilty-until-proven-innocent conception of justice. Reprehensible, then, but what fun! <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Anyone heading to the cinema this February 14 will find themselves conspicuously catered for by this romantic comedy from veteran Garry Marshall (Pretty Woman, Beaches). Throwing out a net to everyone from back-row teenage saliva-swappers to seasoned seniors, the film feels like it has been coldly calculated to hoover up demographics. How? Marshall gives his rom-com the Robert Altman Short Cuts treatment: an enormous megawatt ensemble cast appear in a dozen or so interlocking lurve stories that play out on Valentines Day in Los Angeles. Its supremely efficient and utterly ruthless.<br />There are 19 all-star names above the title (in alphabetical order, naturally) but the lead belongs to Ashton Kutcher. A nice-guy florist, he proposes to his work-addict girlfriend (Jessica Alba), but is obviously much better suited to his teacher best friend (Jennifer Garner). Jessica Biel (is it me, or are the Jessicas interchangeable?) plays a neurotically single sports publicist. Anne Hathaway, an office temp who moonlights as a phone sex operator (little nod to Short Cuts there), hasnt told her new boyfriend about the sideline. Shirley MacLaine, happily married for 50 years, is keeping an old secret from her husband. In what reeks of final-draft add-on, country star Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner from The Twilight Saga pair up as school sweethearts: no actual storyline here, but they tick the pre-teen box big time.<br /><br />These are sassily-scripted but glossy, vacuous fantasies  with the exception of Julia Robertss army captain, whos on short leave from Iraq and meets a guy (Bradley Cooper) on a plane: after some sparky but non-committal flight banter they go their separate ways and both their tales resolve with unexpectedly lovely flourishes. Their stories make the rest of the film look like its got a cold, shiny cash register right where its heart should be.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[All roads lead to Silvio Berlusconi in this spooky documentary about Italys tacky and sinister TV and celebrity culture  a culture that implicates producers, agents, wannabe stars, politicians, paparazzi and Italys prime minister in one bottle-blonde, busty, poolside circle of hell. Director Erik Gandini captures a mood of ground-level desperation  we meet a karate-chopping mechanic who wants to be on reality TV and a gaggle of girls who gyrate wildly in the hope of becoming weathergirls  before introducing two grotesque puppet-masters: Lele Mora, an ageing playboy and agent who throws parties at his Sardinian villa for the C-list crowd and is proud of his Mussolini ringtones (great man, great leader), and Fabrizio Corona, a former paparazzi boss and extortionist who thrives on his ruthless, self-serving image and boasts: Ive become a symbol. A symbol of all thats wrong with modern Italy, we assume.<br /><br />Gandinis voiceover explains his purpose  television and power are one and the same and, of the culture of Berlusconi, we have the feeling hes everywhere, even when hes not visually present  but he allows his often jaw-dropping images to do the talking, and hats (or maybe Y-fronts) off to him for persuading Corona to be filmed preening in the shower. He reminds us that Berlusconi owns three commercial TV channels and controls all state television (so influencing 90 per cent of the countrys viewers), but he prefers intoning a sense of a culture overrun with corrupting vanity to making specific accusations. The combination of terrific footage with a low, rumbling score of doom makes this a compelling horror show.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The original title of the Stieg Larsson novel which became, in translation, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was Men Who Hate Women: a blunt but fitting description of this angry, intelligent but curiously uninvolving Swedish shaggy dog story. The film sees down-at-heel, crusading journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) hired by industrialist Henrik Vanger to look into the disappearance of his beloved niece more than 30 years before. Blomkvists quest is intercut with the story of Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), a bisexual ex-con cyberpunk computer hacker (only in Sweden!) at the mercy of a corrupt, sexually deviant parole officer.<br />Throughout this beautifully photographed, skilfully constructed film theres a sense were skimming lightly over Larssons characters and themes. Blomkvist is the putative hero, but his investigative journey is a little too familiar, his character too clean-cut to be compelling. Its Salander who holds the attention: superbly played by Rapace, shes a grim, spectral presence in the opening scenes, before shes pushed too far and explodes in a moment of shocking, vengeful violence.<br /><br />Such scenes place The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo above the extended TV mystery it easily could have become, but explicit violence only takes you so far. At heart this is a traditional thriller, down to a series of convenient and underwhelming last-act revelations. For fans of Larssons books this could be the highlight of the cinemagoing year  for the rest of us its a solid, enjoyable but emotionally unengaging detective story.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Thirty-five years after Network and All the Presidents Men, in which journalists told uncomfortable truths and defended democracy, Green Zone makes military personnel do the noble work which craven reporters shirk. The only consolation is that the movie is inspired by a work of journalism, Rajiv Chandrasekarans Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraqs Green Zone.<br /><br />Set in Iraq in the months following the 2003 invasion, the film reunites the director and star of The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon; this time, however, we already know the details of the underhanded government action our hero confronts. Damon plays an army warrant officer whose WMD sorties keep coming up empty; unwilling to roll over, hes soon embroiled in a turf war between the CIA and the Pentagon (personified by conscientious Brendan Gleeson and oleaginous Greg Kinnear) while attempting to wrangle a Baathist general (Igal Naor), a useful veteran (Said Faraj) and a useless embedded reporter (Amy Ryan) against a backdrop of more-or-less real events.<br />Greengrasss approach to real-life disaster is far more simplified and pumped up here than it was in United 93 or Bloody Sunday, but theres much to be said for his Bourne in Baghdad approach. The action is robust, the politics simplified but strident, insisting that a wilfully under-prepped war worked against both US and Iraqi interests. By shifting focus from the naively doctrinaire civilians of Chandrasekarans book to street-level soldiers questioning authority, Greengrass concocts a formula with a fighting chance of dispelling the Curse of the Hollywood Iraq Movie. If a picture as conventionally accessible as Green Zone tanks, that campaign is surely lost.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Banksy has a weird relationship with fame. Lets call it the reverse Jordan: hes famous for not being famous. He breeds celebrity then rejects it. Just last year he was the subject of an odd film made by the ICAs ex-chairman Ivan Massow called Banksys Coming to Dinner, in which an actor duped Joan Collins into believing she was hosting a dinner party for the street artist. All signs suggest Collins was party to the gag. But was Banksy also in on it? Probably not. But still it fed his notoriety. His anonymity is a handy tease  a tool which allows him to draw attention to himself while at the same time deflecting it.<br />This is the spirit of Exit Through the Gift Shop, a new documentary brought to us by Banksy but not directed by him (the film has no such credit). It profiles Banksy and prods at issues raised by his success, from originality to commercialisation. But its a wonky, sideways profile in that the film pretends not to be about Banksy. He  or whoever made the film  employs a fall guy to make himself look good. Call it passive self-promotion. Some even call it a hoax. But thats missing the point: even if the final section of the film doesnt feel as honest as the earlier parts, theres nothing to suggest that the whole thing is made up (which is different from savvy editing and presentation). Part of the problem is that we expect a Banksy project to be a joke on us. Whatever the film is, its sparky and funny and invigorating to watch.<br />The fall guy  lets call him Banksys mirror  is Thierry Guetta, a hipster French exile in Los Angeles introduced to us from the beginning as obsessed with video cameras and looking for an outlet for a creeping early middle-aged ennui. Essentially the film has two narrators: Rhys Ifans, buoying the story along in voiceover, and Banksy, who pops up occasionally in silhouette to offer commentary. Both lend their voice to a mass of archive footage, much of it shot by Guetta, who, were told, started filming his cousin Invader (the French bloke who plasters mosaics everywhere) in the late 90s and moved on to other artists, including Shepard Fairey and Banksy.<br />Were told that after many years of filming these artists on roofs, at night or in their studios, Guetta edited his footage into a mess called Life Remote Control. Which is where Banksy decided to take over and turn the archive into something watchable. Which is where we join the party.<br />The cheeky twist in the tale is that Guetta, encouraged by Banksy, then becomes an artist too. He exhibits and sells work at a hyped-up Los Angeles show, and all the signs are that Banksy is closer to this late creative flowering than he admits. Most of Guettas works look like D-grade Banksy rip-offs and theres a sense that theres a smart mind behind this bad work, which includes a giant aerosol can labelled with branding for Campbells Tomato Spray.<br />So, whether Guettas burgeoning art career is under the patronage or direction of Banksy  or both  is the question you must take away. Whatever the answer, the film is a rousing tribute to street art, a crafty autobiography and a cheeky comment on the bravado of artists, talented or otherwise, and the gullibility of their punters  us included.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The post-Poppins supernanny returns thanks to capable screenwriter-star Emma Thompson, whos set the story during World War Two when daddies are away fighting, and children man the home front. Down on the farm, Maggie Gyllenhaals Mrs Green is at a loss when her three terrors are joined by their posh cousins, evacuated from the threat of bombs over Kensington, though its not long before ex-military Nanny McPhee instils improving discipline. The mix is similar to the first film, naughtiness versus magic, but nimbler this time as it shuttles from class warfare to unscrupulous spivs (draft-dodging well-dodgy uncle Rhys Ifans) and the prospect of enemy attack. Its bitty and rather light on mounting excitement, yet Thompson the writer smuggles in cheery elements of Enid Blyton and A Little Princess, the frolicking Old Spot piglets are a delight, and Nannys resourceful jackdaw Edelweiss a cult hero in the making. Director Susanna White, surely one to watch, manages some disarming emotional grace notes under the circumstances.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This Brit romcom has been described as very funny and flimsy  and both are kinda right. Loosely based on Alain de Bottons Essays in Love, it stars the underqualified Brendan Patricks (Horne &amp; Corden) as loser-in-love Duncan. While unconvincingly contemplating suicide, Duncan recalls his past five relationships with unfeasibly attractive women in busy, self-consciously quirky flashbacks.<br /><br />There are bad actors here , and there are great actors  Naomie Harris and Michael Sheen appear alongside evident newbies. Some ideas are inventive  Duncan runs through the odds of meeting his first girlfriend in amusing detail  while others feel lazy and clichd. Theres a steady trickle of fun character observations, but a lack of detail and depth. The film feels a bit like a funny friend who talks too much  sometimes theyre amusing; sometimes you wish theyd shut up. Those willing to overlook the cracks in performances and plot should enjoy it, but they may also wish to revisit High Fidelity to see how its really done.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A work of masterly daring and skill, the new Italian film I Am Love plays out in the late 1990s within a super-rich family called the Recchis. Their power base is a Milanese villa introduced to us by young director Luca Guadagnino as a gilded cage  a marble-and-stone palace too large and ornate to support intimate family life. In the films early scenes Guadagnino laps up this mansion, exploring it with a swirling, fluid camera that turns its world into a character itself. The fictional Recchis recall the Agnellis, another troubled industrialist family which feathered its nest on the back of fascism, but they trade in textiles, not cars, and Guadagnino gives us a brief shot of their mechanised looms at work to stress how business is woven into the fabric of this familys soul.<br />We meet the Recchis on the cusp of change  and change is the films main interest, along with the dangerous strength necessary for any woman to counter the forces of tradition and expectation in such a family. We begin by watching the elderly family head (Gabriele Ferzetti) at dinner as he nominates his successors in a scene of King Lear-like power and unnaturalness. But soon he is dead and our focus and heroine becomes Emma Recchi (Tilda Swinton), the dutiful Russian wife of Tancredi (Pippo Delbono), the familys new head, and mother to two grown-up sons and a daughter attempting her own flight from this patriarchal world. Emmas burgeoning friendship with her sons business partner, Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini), a rural chef, is the nudge that will bring this house of cards down in dramatic, tragic fashion. <br />The story is bold enough, but true daring is at play in the films style. Guadagnino has the confidence to mix big, brash Dallas-style establishing shots of Milan and London and complicated scenes of busy parties with much more intimate, expressive moments. Dialogue becomes less important as the film progresses, and Guadagnino invites us to read the film rather than the characters lips. He also manages to bring the film to an operatic crescendo without losing sight of emotional realities.<br />There are many reasons to recommend this sensual and good-looking film about personal and female liberation. The music is one; it is central to a work that demands that all the films elements work together to create a total cinema. Guadagnino and his star and co-producer, Swinton, persuaded John Adams, the composer of operas such as Nixon in China and Doctor Atomic, to allow his work to be used in a film for the first time and his crashing, arresting, impulsive music is gripping from the start.<br />Its a fitting collaboration. Adams has given modern opera a much-needed shot in the arm and thats what Swinton (who speaks Italian throughout) and Guadagnino are striving to achieve: I Am Love is a brazen blueprint for a cinema that straddles past and future while worrying little about trends of the present. Its a bold experiment rooted in tradition. It plays like smart opera and looks like a marriage of poetic documentary with classical European drama. Swinton and Guadagnino call it Visconti on acid and thats as good a phrase as any to describe the films intoxicating allure.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[George Romeros original The Crazies was a prime slice of raw mid-70s exploitation schlock: scruffy, violent and politically edgy. Breck Eisners remake is slicker, prettier and dumber, but not entirely without merit. The cast is very strong: Timothy Olyphant exudes old-fashioned tough-guy charm as the small town sheriff whose constituents begin falling prey to a disease which turns them into bloodthirsty zombies, while Radha Mitchell provides credible if thankless support as his wife. Theres also an impressively high-strung turn from Joe Anderson (Peter Hook in Control) as a redneck cop on the brink.<br />But the film feels choppy and roughly edited, as though its makers were so keen to keep it short that they hacked out any scares, atmosphere or sense of impending dread. Theres too much story and key details are absent or underexplained. Though far from unwatchable, The Crazies feels like a missed opportunity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Neil Jordan has fallen into a regular pattern of late, following every trip to Hollywood with a more personal Irish indie. You can feel the loving care in every frame of Ondine, but that only serves to make this saccharine, crudely plotted romance feel even more misguided. <br />Colin Farrell plays Syracuse, a trawlerman and recovering alcoholic who pulls a mysterious, scantily clad woman (Alicja Bachleda) from the sea in his net. Bringing her to the mainland, Syracuse and his disabled daughter (the terrific Alison Barry) become convinced that the stranger, who calls herself Ondine, is in fact a mythical selkie: part woman, part seal. <br />These unabashed fairy-tale elements fit uncomfortably with the more earthbound elements of Jordans script, not to mention his habit of getting Bachleda to shed her clothes at every opportunity. A clunky third-act shift into thriller territory only makes Ondine more confused: ambitious and deeply felt, to be sure, but also winsome and wildly uneven.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Unlike its cockney equivalent, the Irish gangster movie  however hackneyed its storyline  can usually be relied upon to deliver a modicum of wit and flair. Perriers Bounty is a prime example: it marries a predictable plot  Cillian Murphy owes money to some bad fellas, complications ensue  with a goodly portion of smart banter, off-kilter characterisation and knockabout violence.<br />The film is flawlessly cast, with Murphys put-upon hero ably backed by Jim Broadbent as his world-weary Pa and Jodie Whitaker as the emotionally compromised woman in his life, while a monstrous, towering Brendan Gleeson lords over proceedings as the titular crime bigwig. They bring a sense of playfulness and pathos to the project that probably wasnt there in the busy, amateurish script, stuffed as it is with twists, switchbacks and gangland clichs. Ian Fitzgibbons direction is a little flat and uninspiring and the urban photography is unnecessarily gritty and downbeat. But despite these setbacks, Perriers Bounty is still a pleasure to watch: not exactly memorable, but packed with enough intellect, incident and strong performances to justify the investment.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Lasse Hallstrms latest is based on a true story  transplanted from 1930s Japan to contemporary New England  about a faithful Akita dog called Hachi. Hallstrms unfussy, effective film uses several visual techniques  dogs eye-view black-and-white footage, sped-up time frames  to tell the often moving tale of Parker Wilson (Richard Gere), a music professor and family man who surrenders to the charms of dog ownership. When Parker dies and his family sells up and moves away, Hachi legs it back to the railway station where his owner used to arrive home from work and keeps vigil there for almost a decade. Sensitively directed and rarely over-sentimental, this touching parable will likely ravish the emotions of dog lovers. Yet the film is as much about the emotional fallout of death as about a mutts loyalty and devotion. As a dog owner, I must confess to having had a large lump in the throat throughout. So call me soppy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Policeman, husband, father, closeted gay man, out gay man, fraudster, prison escapee, fake lawyer, embezzler, prison escapee (again) Georgias Steven Russell has led quite a life. Hes a subject ripe for documentary treatment, but its understandable why Bad Santa writers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa have turned his wild CV into madcap comedy for their directing debut. Unleashing Jim Carrey makes a sort of sense, since his fast-talking energy might help us buy Russells credibility-defying exploits. Unfortunately, though, the bizarre true-life aspect gets swamped by Carreys ramped-up zeal, delivering a series of showpiece flourishes which dazzle at first but then prove wearing.<br />Still, you cant accuse cast or filmmakers of lacking caution, since the treatment barrels through locations and chronology, and its eyebrow-raising to have Carrey and Ewan McGregor  as sweet-natured fellow jailbird Phillip Morris  playing frisky gay lovers. Such forthrightness definitely makes the movie culturally significant (and may explain why US distributors have been reluctant to handle it), yet for all that it never manages to match its robust humour with a convincing love story. Maybe we dont quite buy Jim and Ewans hots for one another, maybe the writing makes Carreys character too much of a psychotic narcissist while rendering McGregor in terms of fluffy-bunny passivity, but either way it just aint happening. Loved the chutzpah, but the heart and the funny bone are left relatively untroubled.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hollywoods campaign to convince audiences that beefy Scots bulldog Gerard Butler can play the romantic lead gathers pace with this misjudged marital crime caper. Butler plays Milo Boyd, an ex-cop turned bail bondsman assigned to haul in his ex-wife Nicole (Jennifer Aniston), a hotshot reporter in deep with the law. The pursuit takes this pair of bickering exes from New York to Atlantic City and back, via a series of perfunctory car chases, poorly choreographed punch-ups and excruciating romantic entanglements.<br />The trouble is not so much that Butler isnt funny  he isnt, even slightly  but that he sucks the merest hint of humour from the entire enterprise. Even proven performers like Aniston and Christine Baranski as a sexually voracious mother-in-law are reduced to desperate mugging and hysterical arm-waving in an attempt to fill the comic vacuum which their muscular co-star leaves in his wake. To be fair, the script gives them little to work with: there are maybe three decent laughs, interspersed with long stretches of interminable, would-be witty banter and one near-unwatchable comedy torture scene. <br />The score, too, is atrocious: infuriatingly cheeky in the comedy scenes, switching to screeching Bon Jovi-esque AOR whenever things kick off. The Bounty Hunter isnt bad enough to be offensive: its simply lazy, trite, smug, irritating and a colossal waste of time, talent and money. Therell be worse films released in 2010  but not many.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[British director Bernard Rose (Anna Karenina, Ivansxtc) continues his ongoing Tolstoy project with this low-budget, DV spin on the Russians banned 1889 novella of sexual jealousy and rage. Much is familiar from 2000s Ivansxtc: Danny Huston again plays a louche, wealthy Los Angeles native (minus the cocaine and call-girls), while Rose again adopts a handheld shooting style, filming in upscale locations and using only available light. This portrait of the Californian rich and powerful is much less savage than Ivansxtc, although again the rolling timbre of Hustons voice and the crafty smile on his face are reason alone to see the film.<br />Huston plays Edgar, a paranoid husband who suspects that his wife, Abby (Elisabeth Rhm)  a lapsed pianist and mother of his kids  is having an affair with Aiden (Matthew Yang King), a violinist with whom she agrees to perform Beethovens Kreutzer Sonata at a fundraising event at their lavish home . Rose intercuts Hustons impetuous behaviour as his imagination runs wild and his anger escalates with flashbacks of his earlier, happier relationship with his wife. <br />The films looseness  many lines feel improvised, as does the camerawork  is mostly attractive and matches Hustons charming, easy presence. The tragedy, when it comes, might not feel as poignant or significant as Ivansxtc, but this is a fun dose of literary soap opera with some likeable performances, including a cameo from Hustons sister, Anjelica, and some authentically racy sex scenes to mark the first throes of Edgar and Abbys love affair.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[As the intro to this excellent documentary asserts, one small Caribbean island continues to dominate Olympic boxing. Sons of Cuba explores the roots of that success, following a year at the Havana City Boxing Academy and a gang of pre-pubescent pugilists training for the under-11s national championships. Director Andrew Lang narrows his focus to three kids  one a poet, one a performer and one a hardened, thoroughbred blood-and-bone boxing superstar in the making. The sense of kinship between the kids and their caring, ambitious coach is deeply moving, as is the boys absolute commitment to their nation and its Commandante, Fidel Castro. But is their grim, ascetic existence really the only way to turn these boys into champions, or is this just a subtle form of state-sanctioned child abuse? Lang, wisely, refuses to judge, preferring to let this beautifully structured story of sacrifice, companionship, grief and glory speak for itself.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This documentary, both rousing and dispiriting, narrated by Samuel L Jackson and produced by The Roddick Foundation, shines a spotlight on the case of two prisoners in Louisianas notorious Angola prison (population: 5,000) who have been lingering in solitary for 37 years for a crime many people believe they never committed. Herman Wallace and Albert Woodfox were minor criminals and members of the Black Panther Party when in 1972 they were accused of murdering a prison guard  a crime of which even the guards wife believes they were innocent, not least because the witnesses were so unreliable (one was blind; another was promised freedom). <br />Another man, Robert King, was later hauled into jail from the outside for investigation and accused of murdering an inmate; together they became known as the Angola Three, although King was finally released in 2001. Interviews with King, Wallace and Woodfox, with lawyers and politicians and even with the guards wife, make this a rounded study and as much a portrait of what its like to spend four decades locked up as a rallying cry for the freedom of innocent men.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For the past year, 3D has been a guarantee of box-office gold, as proven by the runaway success of Avatar. But now, for the first time, a film arrives for which the 3D element may prove to be a commercial hindrance. Its not only that Clash of the Titans will compete with Alice in Wonderland, How to Train Your Dragon and Avatar for the nations 3D screens. More critically than that, the film's conversion to 3D (a decision taken late in the filmmaking process) has rendered this campy, unashamedly old-school but still highly enjoyable blockbuster rather painful to watch.<br />In story terms, Clash of the Titans doesn't stray too far from the beloved 1981 Ray Harryhausen classic which spawned it. The setting is mythical Ancient Greece  an age of Gods, monsters and muscular men in little chainmail skirts. Sam Worthington is Perseus, an orphaned demi-God drawn into the battle between man and the immortals when Hades (Ralph Fiennes), lord of the underworld, threatens to unleash his great sea-beast, the Kraken, on the city of Argos. Accompanied by a ragtag band of warriors, Perseus sets off to learn the secrets of the Kraken and end the reign of the Gods once and for all.<br />Theres no ignoring the fact that Clash of the Titans is a mess: the plot is episodic and rushed, the dialogue blunt and occasionally laughable, and there are far too many characters, few of whom leave much of an impression. Both Worthington and love interest Gemma Arterton look like theyre on a strenuous Aegean package holiday, but luckily theyre surrounded by the likes of Fiennes, Pete Postlethwaite and Liam Neeson as Zeus, whose commanding, armour-clad presence seems, at times, to be the only thing holding this crumbling edifice together.<br />Other notable names dont fare so well: Danny Huston gets a mighty fake beard but just one line as sea-God Poseidon, Mads Mikkelsen does little more than bare his teeth as burly swordsman Draco and, most egregiously, Jason Flemyng gets a terrific backstory and some superb melting-face makeup as ruined ruler Calibos  and that's it. It's is a recurring problem throughout the film: with dialogue and character motivation cut back to the bare minimum, theres no way for anyone to express themselves except through action.<br />But, luckily, this is where Clash of the Titans succeeds. Whatever the flaws in the script, theres no faulting director Louis Leterriers visual ambition: this is a film of mighty vistas, beautifully designed beasts and intense, well-structured combat sequences, all rendered in eye-popping, though still rather fake-looking, CGI. Taking the lessons of The Lord of the Rings to heart, Leterrier goes all-out for excess: his computer-generated camera soars above sprawling cities, endless deserts and blasted underworld hellscapes, lending the film a dizzying, epic scale.<br />A shame, then, that the addition of 3D has rendered much of this grandeur all but unwatchable, blurring the image to a headache-inducing degree and adding absolutely nothing to a film which was obviously shot in two dimensions and should have stayed that way. As an experiment in high-Hollywood style over substance, Clash of the Titans is a very entertaining ride. But take our advice: sidestep the 3D and see it the old fashioned way. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Space has been reliable garganto-vision fodder in museum planetaria for decades, and this latest IMAX spectacle has its share of breathtaking cosmic vistas. But the 20-year-old Hubble Space Telescopewhose repair mission is the subject of this chronicleturns out to be a bit of a stage hog, and audiences expecting a blissout of swirling galaxies will wonder why so much time is spent on astronauts sweating over screws and bolts.</p><p>Of course, just about anything looks fairly impressive blown up to brownstone-size, and the movie offers a mlange of material: astrofolk training underwater, an earthshaking rocket launch, living-quarter antics and artful computer visualizations of Hubbles crown-jewel data. (Its a mix of footage from both the early 1990s and last years sortie, stirred together and haphazardly upgraded to bigger-faster-better 3D status.) Things perk up once the telescopes findings start sending a thousand points of light hurling at usthough these cotton-candy nebulae and whirligig baby stars are each laden with the multiplying cosmic-slop metaphors of Leonardo DiCaprios voiceover. Despite the astronauts bravery and good humor, their work on the Hubble, captured in cluttered shots, is not nearly as exciting as the brave new frontiers conjured up by the term <i>spacewalk.</i> But even if this stroll through the heavens isnt as immersive as, say, the recent Deep Sea IMAX, its still a trip. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The 3D bandwagon keeps rolling with this smart, muscular, animated adventure. On a remote North Atlantic island, the Viking population is suffering harassment from swarms of marauding dragons, until geeky son-of-a-chief Hiccup finds an injured dragon in the woods and suspects this constant state of warfare may be unnecessary.<br />Rejecting the comic whimsy of Cressida Cowells source novel, How to Train Your Dragon is a surprisingly robust affair, backing its juggernaut narrative with a well-judged and timely political subtext which urges young viewers to question received wisdom and make up their own minds, especially when it comes to matters of life and death. The voices can be jarring  the burly adult Vikings are all Scots, while their offspring are whiny Yanks  and the characterisation remains disappointingly old fashioned and unoriginal. But the visuals are striking, the script sharp and well paced and it all wraps up with a breathtaking aerial battle sequence.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Imagine if Guy Ritchie had been weaned on blaxploitation and dubstep rather than eel pie and The Italian Job and youre halfway to understanding Shank, a raucous and violent ghetto drama set on a London council estate of the near future that pits hooded clans of teen marauders against one another in a rudimentary tale of blood vengeance. Like Ritchie, debut director Mo Ali and writer Paul van Carter have clearly dedicated a lot time to making sure their film achieves a measure of street authenticity, and with its inventive production design and spiky, lingo-flecked dialogue, they do succeed in that area. Its a shame, then, that the narrative itself is so slovenly, as our multicultural mob led by avenging angel Junior (Kedar Williams-Stirling) take a long, diversionary road en route to a carve-up with scramble-biking nuisance Tugz (Jerome Holder). The likable performances and humorous interactions between characters show that Ali can work with actors. The hectic direction shows that he has yet to master the art of storytelling. A promising first effort, nonetheless.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Kung-Fu Panda is one of those movies where one assumes the title came first and the entire plot was then extrapolated by committee. Rotund, noodle-selling bear Po (voiced by Jack Black) discovers that he is the living embodiment of an ancient Shaolin legend, which drives him to train as a martial arts expert and confront psychotic snow leopard Tai-Lung. Hes aided on his quest by crotchety Zen master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and his menagerie of high-flying wire-fu legends, the Furious Five.<br /><br />Theres no chop-socky clich too hackneyed for the filmmakers to make meat of. Inscrutable, riddle-spouting guru, check. Ancient mystical jade temple, check. Uptempo training montage, check. The setting is a sort of Disneyland version of ancient China, all fast-running waterfalls, snapping chopsticks and spiralling bamboo parasols. The script is as thin as rice paper and the characters, though likeable, are simply too plentiful, and too many of them feel short-changed. <br />The ending was extensively rewritten and it shows, limping to an underwhelming conclusion from which many of the best characters are inexplicably absent. But for all its faults, theres something inescapably likeable about Kung-Fu Panda. Po is a winning hero, engagingly silly and offbeat, particularly in his workout scenes with the frustrated, irascible Shifu. Villain Tai-Lung, voiced with fearsome dignity by Ian McShane , is one of the best cartoon baddies since Shere Khan, and his prison-escape set piece is the standout here, explosive and enthralling.<br /><br />This is where the movie comes into its own. The action sequences are often astounding, the high-octane animated choreography superbly executed. Theres nothing radical about the visuals themselves  the character and landscape design is entirely by-the-numbers. But weve never seen a cartoon move this fast before, the camera leaping and swooping along with its gravity-proof protagonists. <br />As the credits roll, the films many flaws come sharply into focus. But while it lasts, Kung-Fu Panda is something of a guilty treat.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In what could be one of the greatest films ever made about the emotional realities of a damaged mind, this giddily disorientating latest from Argentinian director Lucrecia Martel (La Cinaga, The Holy Girl) is a work of frenzied genius. It opens with glamorous, middle-aged dentist Vero (Mara Onetto  a tour de force) driving along a quiet dirt track. Theres a sudden bump. Shes hit something. But what? A dog? Or maybe one of the teens weve seen loitering on the roadside? Clutching her brow, she speeds off without finding out what, exactly, just dented her fender.<br />As with the question of who is sending the tapes in Michael Hanekes Hidden, Martel spends the remainder of the film cultivating a mystery whose solution, it transpires, may be extraneous to the actual story she is trying to tell. Casually dispensing with exposition and formal character introductions, she instead burdens us with an intimate, first-hand experience of Veros temporary discombobulation. Veros tragic attempts to bluff her way through a life that has lost all meaning are perfectly realised by Martels brand of ambient, almost dreamlike social realism, where each shot demands a swift decoding to reveal its ulterior purpose.<br />In line with the directors previous films, theres an incisive political subtext lurking under this ostensibly interior drama. While Veros loss of memory adds a level of discomfort to her daily life, it also allows her a spell of self-reflection and moral rejuvenation. Her anxiety awakens a mindfulness of her bourgeois complacency which in turn makes her reassess the connections she has with her own family. The bitter closing shot, though, suggests that you can never change those accustomed to a life of privileged conformity. Its a supremely disconcerting kiss-off to a cinematic head-trip like no other.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Usually when critics write about American documentary-maker Frederick Wiseman, hes described as cinemas foremost chronicler of Western institutions, from welfare offices (Welfare) and schools (High School) to research laboratories (Primate) and even entire towns (Aspen). Considering the subjects of his many films over the past 40 years, the label has a cosy logic to it. But it undersells much of what makes Wiseman one of the unheralded giants of modern cinema: his cool formal assurance; his non-patronising, unpretentious show dont tell technique; and most vitally, his knack for locating poetry in even the most mundane human behaviour.<br />For his thirty-eighth film, and his second about a ballet company after 1995s Ballet, Wiseman documents three months spent in the opulent halls, rehearsal rooms and performance spaces of Pariss Palais Garnier, home of the Paris Opera Ballet. With his long-time cinematographer John Davey, a single camera assistant and a crate of Super 16 film, he works his minimalist magic to utterly immersive effect, adding another quietly transcendent movie to his unique body of work.<br />After setting the scene with a series of exquisite panoramic shots of the Paris skyline, were whisked into the haunting basement corridors of the baroque Palais and allowed to peek in on a rehearsal in full flow. Over the course of the film, we monitor the progress of seven ballets of varying styles and sizes, from their embryonic practice stages to their virtuosic final performances.<br />To capture this artistic evolution, Wiseman merely finds himself a corner and allows his camera the room to soak up the minutiae of all thats happening around him in a series of long, unbroken, beautifully composed takes. We see dancers zealously mimicking the complex movements of their instructors. We see technicians labouring over props and sets while in-house tailors pore over the individual sequins on every costume. We even see a man who keeps bees on the roof of the building.<br /><br />Beyond exploring the structures of organisations such as the Paris Opera Ballet, Wiseman is equally interested in discovering how people behave and communicate at work. Here, the interactions between dancer and instructor are as fascinating and full of electricity as the dances themselves, based on intricate wordless exchanges where the expressiveness of simple noises and movements patch over the cracks that ordinary language cant cover. For Wiseman, lifes rhythms are just as important as its incidents, and as a result, La Danse is an example of cinema at its most musical, an awe-inspiring celebration of body, mind and movement.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This years romantic heartthrob, R-Patz  Twilight star Robert Pattinson to those non-fanatics among you  has an executive-producer credit attached to this unobjectionable but slightly arch and sentimentalised 2001-set New York romantic drama. This may suggest an effort on his part to add thespian respect and some rebellious street-cred to his image. If so, he might have chosen a more subtle director than Allen Coulter (Hollywoodland, TVs Nurse Jackie, The Sopranos etc) and a better script than this clichd, strangely humourless effort by newcomer Will Fetters.Nevertheless, the all-important romantic mechanics work well enough. <br />The movies meet-cute occurs at the NYU canteen where conflicted rich kid Tyler (Pattinson) dare-dates overprotected, lone-parented Ally (petite star Emilie de Ravin from Lost) on the prompting of Tylers standard-issue flatmate and gooseberry, Aidan (Tate Ellington). Fate, family loss, father obsession and too much booze have brought them together: Allys cop dad (Chris Cooper, wasted) had previously banged up Tyler for a back-street brawl, which explains the cool-looking bruises the nice but nihilistic 21 year old sports throughout the movie  as well as the angry dads embargo and the curtailment of their brief idyll as the calendar turns fatefully towards September<br />Its a movie that craves much indulgence: Pattinson, playing handsome, mixed-up and misunderstood, is watchable enough but he aint no Olivier; while de Ravin bears her straitjacket role of pretty, sweet and wise with good grace. But, be warned, if youre vulnerable to outrageous, cringe-inducing implausibilities  not least the ludicrous stand-up row between Tyler and his father in the latters Twin Towers boardroom  youd best give this one a miss.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Tucked away just off Ladbroke Grove, the Carmelite Monastery of the Most Holy Trinity has been there since 1878, but only now have cameras been allowed a peek inside. The result is a gently reflective portrait which unobtrusively records the daily lot of this cloistered order, but doesnt really dig much deeper than that. Unfolding against the passing seasons, the film quietly observes Carmelite nuns as they carry out devotions and domestic chores alike, maintaining a vow of silence relaxed only during official recreation time. The buzz of a chainsaw in the garden, the chinnnngg! of an iMac start-up and the rumble of nearby traffic noise are reminders of the modern world, but the liturgical rituals and soundless prayers hint at the sisters daily engagement with another realm seemingly beyond our reach.<br />A quartet of impeccably articulate senior nuns voice their opinions on prayer as a place where God can come and speak, but also hint at their struggles to keep the faith during years when theyve felt alone and unanswered. Such vulnerability humanises them for a moment, as do the amusing incongruities of eco-friendly washing powder or jaunty folk dancing. Mostly, though, there remains a benign distance between subject and viewer, which director Michael Whytes modest, somewhat passive approach is unable to breach  no match for the palpable cinematic transcendence of Into Great Silence, Philip Grnings monumentally framed 2005 study of the Grande Chartreuse monastery in the Swiss Alps. No Greater Love knows what spirituality looks like but, pleasantly calming though it is, cant really take us inside.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In 1950, the movies recognised stardom as a pathological disorder. Exhibit A was Sunset Blvd, exhibit B All About Eve. Set in the Broadway jungle rather than among the sun-burnt eager beavers of Hollywood, Joseph L Mankiewiczs film dissects the narcissism and hypocrisy of the spotlight as sharply as Wilders, but pays equal attention to the challenges of enacting womanhood. All About My Mother (not to mention Showgirls) would be unimaginable without it. Anne Baxter is Eve Harrington, the wide-eyed stage-door hanger-on who insinuates her way into the world of Bette Davis sacred monster, Margo Channing; butter-might-just-melt meets gin-hold-the-tonic. The fan who makes an audience of the stars, Eve is soon attracting her own admirers, as well as barbs worthy of Mankiewiczs 30s newsroom pedigree. Edith Heads costumes stress the antagonism: Eve enters in a sexy-modest trenchcoat-and-trilby combo, and could anyone but Davis pull off a ball gown with pockets? Meanwhile, the real threat  Marilyn Monroe  sits at the partys edge, shining, angling for another drink.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>This live action version of the 1960s cartoon uses CGI to make its canine hero talk and fly, but thats about the only modern touch in this plodding, old-fashioned caper. Misfit mutt Shoeshine (voiced by Jason Lee) gets a dose of a chemical formula that makes him Underdog  so dubbed by his new human pal, insipid youngster Jack (Alex Neuberger).</p><p>Jacks equally uninspiring father (Jim Belushi) gets dragged into the drama when evil scientist Dr Barsinister (Peter Dinklage) gets wind of Underdogs conspicuous powers, which hes using to help people, Lassie-style. Dr Barsinister, naturally, has other plans for his formula, involving a bomb plot on the city and general world domination. </p><p>A few amusing one-liners creep into the script  boosted in no small part by Lees delivery  but the plots too derivative to deliver. Children with a fondness for pooches and a lack of movie knowledge will be well enough served, but this isnt one of those crossover comedies thats going to get the parents chuckling.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[If the idea of Alvin and his chirruping chipmunks friends sounds familiar, it should: the sped-up, squeaky voices of the cartoon creatures have been irritating audiences since the 50s smash hit The Chipmunk Song. This live action version sees the computer-generated furry trio Alvin, Simon and Theodore wind up in LA when their tree is felled for Christmas. Not so much innocents abroad as sussed little mammals who speak like urban teens, they become the toast of the town thanks to their vocal talents. The musical numbers are initially appealing  think close harmonies and smart foot stepping to the likes of Funkytown  but the novelty is likely to wear thin for adults when the munks get kitted out as a street boy band. Jason Lee pratfalls away amusingly enough as the songwriter who becomes the boys reluctant father figure, and his wry approach lends an edge to some of the scripts wittier moments. But the storys downhill slide into a hypocritical rant about commerce and the music industry does it no favours.]]></review>

When a hi-tech space probe veers off course on to an uncharted planet, a team of NASA chimpanzees are assigned to a retrieval mission. With Owen Wilson clearly unavailable, SNL alumnus Andy Samberg provides the voice for Ham, the laconic jokester forced to prove his worth. Despite a painfully lurid visual palette and some limp scripting, Space Chimps at least succeeds as undemanding multiplex fare.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[After much tabloid frenzy, the frigid and terrifyingly wholesome tweeny franchise High School Musical reaches part three. It stars Zac Efron, a young fellow of such flawless matinee-idol good looks that he could well have been manufactured in a plastics factory. Set in an immaculately clean Albuquerque high school, the film offers an America of balanced gender quotients, perfect racial mixtures, social conformity, unquestioningly supportive parents, universal teen virginity, gourmet school canteens, universities on tap, prom fixations, detached mini-mansions, plush flowerbeds, alpine vistas and insipid, meaningless pop tunes. Irony is very much on the blacklist. Its the kind of film you imagine well all be sat in front of by the future world high commander when were all brain-drained zombie automatons: Totalitarian Gap Models Sing Pop is what it should be called. <br />Parents might find solace in the fact that High School Musical contains no product placements, but then the film is the product  one long, gaudy, squeaky-clean advertisement. And when we leave the cinema, we can expect to be drowned mercilessly by the merchandising tsunami that follows. Its possible that  for perhaps the first time ever  youll actually wish the film had more product placement: just something, anything, to connect it to reality. Indeed, High School Musical 3 is a film that is so disengaged with the real problems faced by young teenagers that it makes Dirty Dancing look like Les Quatre Cents Coups. The bottom line is, if youve not already booked tickets for the entire family, think twice before being caught up in the hype. At best, youll be disappointed; at worst, youll want to blow up a high school.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[According to the blurb, Fly Me to the Moon is the first computer-animated film designed, created and produced exclusively for the 3D experience. Whether it looks any better than a 2D-to-3D transfer like Meet the Robinsons is a moot point, but there are a few sequences here that use the third dimension to dazzling effect.<br /><br />Nat, IQ and Scooter are houseflies with a mission: to hitch a ride to the moon with the Apollo 11 space team. Once in orbit, they solve a technical glitch while Nats grandpa averts disaster in mission control by thwarting the plans of a Russian infiltrator, Yegor. Its very superficial but endurable in the main, even though it cant resist that old chestnut of painting the Russians as baddies. And while it may not teach sprogs anything about insects  these ones have human eyes and four limbs  director Ben Stassen has made a fair fist of portraying the Apollo mission with some accuracy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Strangely, if somehow confidently, a snarky Midwesterner, Chris Smith, still best known for chasing down wanna-be horror director Mark Borchardt in <i>American Movie,</i> has reinvented himself as a chronicler of small-scale Subcontinental drama. <i>The Pool,</i> Smiths India-made latest, may remind you of <i>Chop Shop</i> or <i>Offside,</i> two recent tales that quietly evoke life on the margins. This isnt Wes Anderson brassily pushing his luggage through <i>The Darjeeling Limited.</i> The respectfulness is winning.</p><p>Lets not question the whys or hows. <i>The Pool</i> takes its original Iowa-based material, written by Randy Russell, and translates it to simmering Panjim, Goa, where industrious youths Venkatesh (Chavan) and Jhangir (Badshah) seem to be constantly cleaning floors. They make a funny couple, the tall, sullen Venkatesh and his tiny, forthright buddy. After toiling daily, they sit in a high tree and observe a serene backyard dominated by a still pool. It is a place of wealth and exclusion, and already, theres something not quite right about it.</p><p>Even as Smith introduces more predictable elementsnotably the throaty cool chick (Mohan, ideal for a Sofia Coppola movie) whose backyard this isthe film never rushes into hyperbole or cuteness. If anything, <i>The Pool</i> feels slightly underdramatized, with surrogate dad Nana Patekar providing a needed shot of gravitas. But the events of these languorous weeks sustain an insistent pull, not in the direction of aching hearts so much as differences of class and the desire to make worldly amends. Guilt and forgiveness hang over the movie; its hard to think of a more welcome piece of American filmmaking.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ramin Bahrani made a considerable impression with his first two films, Man Push Cart and Chop Shop: low-budget, ground-level portraits of Sisyphean yet dignified solo existences in modern New York. His third film builds on their neo-realist aesthetic and use of non-professionals while expanding the focus to concentrate on a relationship. Solo (Souymane Sy Savan), a garrulous Senegalese cab driver in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (Bahranis home town), is hired by world-weary good old boy William (Red West) to drop him off a couple of weeks hence at what can only be a suicidal assignation. <br />Baffled by his nihilism, the mindful cabbie determines to find a way to reinspire the old man while trying to maintain his relationship with his wife and stepdaughter. The set-up has the ingredients of a mawkish tale of redemption and hugging but Bahrani delivers something else: an endearing character piece shot through with beauty and humility in which, thanks to his leads open, sometimes vulnerable performances, tolerance and respect take precedence. Serious and moving without being solemn or pompous.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The vague term indie rock has shifted a lot in meaning over three decades, but some associations have stuck, namely loud guitars, black-framed glasses and skinny teens in skinny jeans. An unabashed celebration of indie-ness in its most recognisable form, 1234 is unlikely to make many converts but will appeal to anyone whos ever bought the same single on three different formats just to get all the B-sides.<br />Debut writer-director Giles Borg knows his territory: the film is a simple tale of homemade rock n roll romance and takes place in a series of rehearsal studios, pub back rooms and arts labs where his fey, shuffling cast of awkward twentysomethings meet, make music, make eyes and sort of fall in love to a soundtrack of late 90s DIY seven-inches. Its heartfelt, nicely written, competently directed and entertaining, though the the hipper-than-thou namedropping is a bit tiresome, and the underwhelming climax is frustrating in the extreme.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Pixars latest animated marvel may not reach the same heights of wonderment as a Wall-E or a Ratatouille, but those are tough boots to fill and this short, sharp and sweet fantasy still manages to reaffirm its makers as world leaders in the kind of popular animation that embraces ideas and the real world alongside fun and fantasy. Theres just one problem: how do you wipe away a tear while wearing those chunky 3D glasses?<br />Neither a rat nor a robot, the films hero is Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Edward Asner), an elderly man of Middle America who as a youth dreamed of becoming an explorer like Amundsen or Scott. Work and family took over, years passed, and now hes a long-faced widower, living in an old-fashioned home right in the middle of a metropolis. White-haired, square-jawed and stout, he looks like a more homely version of an older Norman Mailer. To outsiders he appears a frail grump, but we know hes mourning his wife and  in some ways  his life.<br />The film is co-directed by Pixar stalwarts Pete Docter and Bob Peterson and  like Wall-E before it  knows the value of silence as well as the need for souped-up action episodes to keep kids awake. As in Wall-E, too, the most grown-up stuff comes early: a brilliant, melancholy chapter, free of talk, runs through Carls life from boyhood to dotage, its triumphs and disappointments: its a staggeringly effective, sad sequence. <br />The story begins as the authorities threaten to place Carl in care after he has a scrap with a property developer looking to bulldoze his home. Carls response to this bureaucratic heavy-handedness is a bugle call to the gods of animation. He ties a thousand balloons to his home and floats off, house and all, to South America to find the waterfalls which he and his wife always dreamed of visiting. But he doesnt bargain on a passenger. In tow is Russell, a podgy child and a wilderness explorer, who wants to help Carl cross a road so that he can win an achievement badge.The balloons are a showcase for modern digital animation as they convincingly float and shimmer; the jungle, too, is a canvas for an explosion of colours and various strange beasts. <br />Theres a touch of Fitzcarraldo as Carl and Russell drag this old mans home through a jungle while fighting off the maniacal ambitions of an even more elderly adventurer who lives in the wilderness. Its not the only element of Up that recalls Herzogs determination to show nature laughing in the face of man. Its a running theme  and gag  throughout. And theres even something of Timothy Treadwell from Grizzly Man about wide-eyed Russell.<br />So, Pixar triumphs again with a delirious fantasy that has one leg in the human world of hopes dashed and realised, and the other in the cartoon tradition of journeying and adventure. The crisp 3D is never gimmicky and the entire film is blessed with the light and air of bright but never gaudy colours.<br />Watch our interview with co-director Pete Docter and producer Jonas Rivera<br /></p>]]></review>

Educational tidbits are thrown out at regular intervals (Amelia Earhart was the first woman to cross the Atlantic, a fact reiterated three times, as if it will appear on a post-film quiz), no doubt to make parents feel like their kids are learning something.

      <review><![CDATA[Mission: Impossible and Short Circuit meet Babe in this passable CGI-enhanced live-action kiddie diversion which takes suspension of disbelief to new levels by way of an assemblage of talking, crime-fighting guinea pigs.The padded-out story essentially revolves around malevolent entrepreneur Bill Nighys clichd plan to rule the world by having questionable military-grade microchips installed in his companys widely-distributed domestic appliances. When Zach Galifianakiss Dr Dolittle-like miltary boffin smells a rat, he sends in twitchy-nosed rodent Darwin and his cute, well-equipped brethren to carry out a spot of against-the-clock espionage. Hollywoods current sheep-like insistence on releasing most kids films in 3D continues unabated with this sprog-friendly Jerry Bruckheimer chase-fest. Rugrats will probably think differently, but I for one have had enough of watching fuzzy footage through stupid glasses. Though the film as a whole delivers ample thrills, it does lag occasionally and is encumbered by bland voiceovers and a lack of laughs]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Michael Moore still has a good eye for a stunt. Toward the end of Capitalism: A Love Story, his latest documentary polemic about the iniquities of contemporary American culture, he strides through Lower Manhattans Financial District, enclosing the headquarters of various banks and financial institutions within yards and yards of black-and-yellow police tape marked Crime Scene  Do Not Cross. <br />Its as satisfying an emblem of the rottenness at the heart of the system as you could hope for. Its also one of several neat touches in a picture that adheres to Moore form: a thesis to which many liberals would be instinctively favourable (in this case that untrammelled capitalism is socially harmful) is illustrated with engaging and impactful stunts (turning up at the headquarters of Goldman Sachs in an armoured van to ask for the bail-out money back), moving personal testimony (footage of victims of mortgage foreclosures and lay-offs) and an argument that wobbles between locally convincing detail, dubious extrapolation and preposterously unfounded assertion.<br />Capitalism is at its strongest when considered in its domestic context. Die-hard Economist readers aside, few Europeans subscribe to the market-capitalist purism that is perceived in many parts of the US, including some of the poorest, as not just an economic good but a moral and patriotic duty. Moore does a good rhetorical job of questioning the compatibility of capitalism with democracy and Christianity  one priest calls the system a radical evil  in a way that is not controversial here but will shock some Americans. <br />Theres a persuasive if simplified momentum to his potted history of post-war US economics that moves from the prosperity of the 50s through the growing inequality of the 80s to the current catastrophe, illustrated with archive material that ranges from the telling (Reagans numerous spokesmodel gigs) to sub-Adam Curtis glibness. Moores own family home movies and the history of his home town of Flint, Michigan, are put to nice use too. And he presents some outrageous contemporary instances of capitalism gone wild, such as judges locking kids up in exchange for bungs from private borstals and companies taking out profiteering life insurance  actually called dead peasant policies  on their staff.<br />But when it comes to what should be the smoking gun  the subprime meltdown and the financial crisis and global slump it catalysed  Capitalism fires blanks. Moore offers no cohesive argument about how the mortgage crisis happened, why the ramifications were so grave and certainly not why, as he alleges, the US government bail-out amounted to a financial coup dtat. <br />The thesis that rapacious capitalism has horrific social consequences is credible and well illustrated, if hardly eye-opening to European viewers (or, frankly, to Moores likely audience at home); the suggestions that that same capitalism is undemocratic and currently vulnerable to more equitable alternatives require stronger arguments than Moore can rally here. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The title suggests an intimate meeting of the ruler and the ruled as in The Last King of Scotland, but Robert Mugabe only appears in news clips in this very local and often suffocating documentary portrait of a disappearing way of life in Zimbabwe, filmed in secret and under threat of violence. The filmmakers spend ample time with one family of white farmers, the Campbells, who are fighting to keep their property in the face of the Zanu PF governments decision to redistribute land and execute that ruling by force.<br />The films strength lies in its fearless reportage: the filmmakers are present at some extraordinary events, from the arrival of a ministers son to confiscate the land (and his vitriolic speech about Europeans) to the familys various and often futile trips to a regional court in Namibia to seek legal help against the proposed confiscation of their property. The sense of violence, real and threatened, is terrifying, although footage of the Campbells relatives living in comfort in rural Kent is a sobering reminder that white Africans with some wealth and European links, such as the Campbells, ultimately have more chance of an alternative way of life than the black Zimbabweans who work for them.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Read our interview with Poliakoff here</i><br />A political yarn  sometimes creepy, sometimes daft  in the Hitchcockian vein, TV dramatist-playwright Stephen Poliakoffs first film for cinema in a decade is a claustrophobic drama relating to appeasement and the aristocracy in 1939. Poliakoff channels a high-level conspiracy, based on fact, through one high-living family, of which Bill Nighys Alexander is the calm, unreadable patriarch and Romola Garais Anne is the eldest but adopted sibling.<br /><br />Poliakoff places a game Garai in the paranoid centre of the action: a bit like Margaret Lockwood in The Lady Vanishes or Cary Grant in North by Northwest, she appears in every scene bar a modern-day framing device that sadly dilutes some of the films more opaque elements. As Anne stumbles upon some dastardly goings-on, we see everything through her eyes so that you wonder whether shes a victim or just untrustworthy. Poliakoffs heightened dialogue and his actors arch delivery are an acquired taste, but somehow they mostly suit the sense of a nightmare enveloping Anne. If only the plotting were more convincing and the prologue and epilogue less distracting.<br /><i>Read our interview with Poliakoff here</i><br />]]></review>

Theres train-hopping, working in the fields, running away, fights with each other and sex with strangers; the boys make convincing lust objects for a variety of figures. You might think of Y Tu Mam Tambin or Drle de Felix or Two Lane Blacktop or even Days of Heaven. Vincent shows a confident reticence: theres not much dialogue but a lot of travelling shots and play with mobility and stasis. Plenty of work is done by the ambient score and rapport between the Carril brothers  an unarticulated, sometimes animalistic co-dependence that easily swings between play, violence and support and is expressed surprisingly well in a wordless anime prologue whose feel, both simple and complex, joyful and dark, is an apt introduction.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Far more deserving of the hoopla Mike Figgis received for his single-take, multicamera drama <i>Timecode</i> (2000), Finnish visual artist Eija-Liisa Ahtilas experimental narrative truly pushes forward the possibilities of split-screen cinema. Inspired by a real-life incident during the 50s in which two Algerian boys stabbed their young French playmate, the film presents a cryptically lyrical investigation of bridgesbetween history and modernity, Western and Arab cultures, home and identity. Elsewhere, a 40-ish female poet (Outinen) is greeted by Death, whose fateful job causes one character to ponder in voiceover: When you die, where are you? And where is where?</p><p>Everything connects through structure and form: Via screen quadrants, the images speak to each other in two dimensions (not unlike <i>The Brady Bunch </i>credits), inventively in three (glowing words float toward the camera in the top frames, then appear backwards as they move away in the reverse-shot down below), and sometimes four (a knife spins one way, background elements conjunctively spin the other). Time is bent, space is expanded, characters in different eras react to the same noises and were left wondering how much more brilliantly this could unfold in Ahtilas alternate version: a six-channel installation. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Straying perilously close to TV-movie territory, this latest from Italian veteran Comencini manages to inject what sounds like an MOR textbook weepie, about the emotional toil of premature birth, with a serious dose of integrity and pathos. This is chiefly down to a very affecting and discreet performance from Buy as self-assured middle aged teacher Maria who is unable to hold down a relationship. Her life takes a turn for the existentially harrowing as another fleeting lover waves her goodbye and she finds herself alone and carrying child. After a needlessly baggy preamble, the focus sharpens in the second half as Maria is forced to take stock of her life and her future as her daughter spends a crucial two months inside an incubator. A little soapy, for sure, but it wont take much for you to succumb to the films life-affirming charms. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The classic French family drama gets a modern reboot in this unstoppably entertaining saga of life, love, death, pop music and an ongoing battle to cut down on the ciggies. Director Rmi Bezanons smart script selects one key day in the past for each member of a typical suburban household, building up a picture of what makes them tick and drives them mad, as both individuals and a unit. We start in 1988 on the day older brother Pio Marma leaves the nest, and by the time punkette sis Dborah Franois, stoic dad Jacques Gamblin (who still thinks hes a rebel, even though hes middle aged with three grown-up kids) and company make it to the millennium, we feel weve lived through it with them. Flawlessly acted, this film will prompt guffaws and nods of quiet recognition in equal measure, managing that rare trick of being accessible without dumbing down or turning naff. Richard Curtis, watch and weep.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Scarred and tattooed, the swashbuckling hero of this dark sword and sorcery movie bears the marks of his brutal life like stigmata; the impression left by British writer-director Michael J Bassetts monstrously entertaining action-adventure is just as indelible. Rather than adapt one of the Savage Tales of Solomon Kane written by Conan the Barbarian creator Robert E Howard, Bassett has created a character-driven yet action-packed origins story, one that traces his heros journey from bloodthirsty pirate through peaceful pilgrim to conflicted Puritan avenger  complete with cape, distinctive black hat, pistols and swords. James Purefoy is intensely charismatic as Kane, who, escaping the clutches of a soul-sucking demon, renounces violence. But when the Puritan family he befriends is slaughtered by the sorcerer Malachis disfigured henchman, he takes up the sword again, vowing to rescue their enslaved daughter Meredith (Rachel Hurd-Wood). Grounded in a believable sixteenth-century English milieu that sharpens rather than blunts its fantastical edge, the films epic vision bears comparison with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, its imaginative supernatural elements confidently fused with a savage reality.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Nick Twisp is confused. Hes a literate, Sinatra-loving sophisticate, so why does his virginity feel like a terminal affliction? Male adolescent ferment was ever thus, but leading man Michael Cera, as hes done in Superbad, Juno and Nick and Noras Infinite Playlist, brings a remarkably sympathetic presence to the travails of dweebdom. Whether you feel youve already seen Cera strut his geeky stuff once too often may well determine your reaction to this adaptation of CD Paynes cult novel, but its still passably diverting fare as he meets the girl of his dreams in the unlovely environs of the Restless Axles trailer park. She is Sheeni (Portia Doubleday), beautiful, a total Francophile, and has even heard of Yasujiro Ozu, but to be with her hes going to have to escape from home. Hes going to have to be a very bad boy.<br />Quite a challenge for the congenitally meek Nick, so he creates a moustachioed, Gauloise-puffing alter ego Franois Dillinger to say and do things he cant quite manage himself, setting in motion sundry jolly japes and escalating mayhem which complicate the pursuit of his affections. The tone throughout is moderately quirky rather than full-on teen-flick vulgarian, bolstered by indie-cred cameos from Steve Buscemi (his nervy dad) and Ray Liotta (his moms psycho-cop suitor), and garnished with cute animated interludes. A little of everything, actually, which almost disguises the fact that the movies not overly amusing, never truly insightful and trying rather too hard to be cultish. But we do like the Cera boy. We really do. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This wistful and amiable May-to-December romance sees glum college student Haru (Hikari Mitsushima) ditch her boorish boyfriend and embrace her inner lesbian. Once Haru is propositioned in a coffee shop by peppy prosthetic-limb maker Riko (Eriko Nakamura), its not long before the pair are feverishly texting each other trying to determine if this is The Real Deal. Avoiding the platitudes usually associated with the teens-in-love genre, debut director And Momoko is mindful of the small, private moments that can alert us of future disquiet within a relationship. It comes as little surprise that the film is adapted from a manga (by Erica Sakurazawa): the blunt, square-on shooting style and leisurely paced edits give the impression of scanning a comic book. And while the rambling story prevents it from being truly penetrating, the bittersweet tone and quiet performances make for a gratifying attempt to decipher the mysteries of love.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The Rape of Nanking in 1937 was a sign of things to come in World War II: an estimated 300,000 Chinese civilians were massacred by the Japanese army, and untold numbers of women and children subjected to relentless sexual abuse. Only one place in the city was safe: a weapons-free zone created and policed by a commitee of international residents under the direction of Siemens engineer and Nazi Party member John Rabe, from whose diaries this impressive but rather traditional film is adapted.<br />Its a terrific tale, competently told. But director Florian Gallenbergers script and direction are a touch schematic, while his international cast, including stern Ulrich Tukur as Rabe and Steve Buscemi as his sardonic American collaborator Wilson, appear to be going through the motions rather than getting to grips with the reality of the story. As a bank holiday war movie, City of War works fine. But doesnt the memory of those who died in Nanking  and those who struggled to help them  deserve better?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Boots (Gary Stretch) is an ard case. We know this because: a) he beats a guy half to death in the first scene, b) hes not scared of Vinnie Jones and c) even though his mum and dad speak with middle-English accents and his brother is running for prime minister, he still talks like a no-shit toughnut of non-specific Northern origin. Its oversights like this that make The Heavy slightly more cackhandedly entertaining than the average unwatchable cockney gangland epic. The plot is risible, the dialogue ripe, the characters paper thin and painfully familiar. Its directed with clunky predictability and acted with all the subtlety and grace of an amateur dramatics production of Get Carter. But in the plus column, we get Vinnie sporting the most unintentionally hilarious goatee in ard-man history, and Lee Ryan from Blue convincing as a snivelling, effeminate lackey. Ryan is by far the best thing in the movie  which is as damning an indictment as I can imagine.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[French director Claire Deniss marvellous latest feature is a portrait of the close relationship between widowed Parisian train driver Lionel (Alex Descas) and his affectionate student daughter, Josphine (Mati Diop). Critics have welcomed it as both her warmest movie and, with its quiet observation of small ritual, her most affirmative and Ozu-esque. But though its true that 35 Shots demonstrates an extraordinary reflective ease and contains possibly more hugs and smiles than Deniss entire oeuvre to date, that is not to say it is a film free of tribulations, tensions and taboos.<br />The story is simple, a collection of scenes from the life of this small family who live in a flat in the Rue de la Guadeloupe, a little nest where Lionel escapes from the loneliness of his cab and the memory of his losses, and from which Josphine, inhibited from fullly developing her relationships with her neighbours, surrogate mother Gabrielle (Nicole Dogue) and suitor No (Grgoire Colin), must soon fly.<br /><br />From this, Denis magically evokes a liberal meditation on family, harmony, loyalty and belonging and their corollaries  loss, transgression, loneliness and separation  and achieves a sweet unity, not least through a beautifully discreet use of symbols, motifs and metaphors. Thus as cinematographer Agns Godards artful visual correspondences (an RER train and a block of flats shot at night) deepen an understanding of social context, the films various vehicles  Lionels train thundering into north Paris, his motorbike, the bicycle blocking the hallway  suggest not only specifics of occupation or class, but also journeys of different speeds. The films extraordinary economy is typified by a lovely, spontaneous caf scene where the principles dance to the Commodores Nightshift, a mini-ballet touchingly evocative of their separate feelings, relationships and destinies.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[British writer-director-producer Peter Strickland has decamped to the Transylvanian countryside to fashion a moody and satisfyingly archaic debut drama about a scrawny, middle-aged mother whose sudden lust for vengeance is purely primal. The enigmatic Katalin Varga (Hilda Peter) is ostracised from her village and rejected by her loving husband when a horrid discrepancy from her past comes to light. Shedding no tears, she collects her son Orbn (Norbert Tanko), gathers up her few belongings and heads off on horse and cart to visit grandmother. The purpose of  and not to mention her violent commitment to  her mission becomes apparent late in the film, as a series of brutal encounters suggest that she may not be as mentally balanced as we initially assume.<br />Stricklands intricate screenplay thrives on not letting us see around the next corner until the very last moment  scenes are often trailed with mysterious preambles, such as when Katalin seduces a man around a campfire and then follows him to a bar before her intentions become clear. Visually, Strickland portrays the same, Romany milieu as Tony Gatlif does but clearly with his mind on the desolate landscapes of the American western. Technical flourishes, such as deploying dense soundscapes of white noise and ambient yelping, imbue unremarkable scenes with a brooding, ambiguous tension. Theres the occasional contrivance to shunt the story onwards, but its not enough to cloud the fact that Strickland and his star, Peter, have delivered a film of remarkable assurance and intensity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The Pixar crew have been smugly ensconced as kings of their computer-animated castle for a while now, secure in the knowledge that while the other animation houses  with their sass-talking sloths and farting ogres  might amuse the little uns for a couple of hours, theyd never trouble the pantheon of cartoon greats. Sony Picturess Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs may not scale the artistic heights of a Finding Nemo or Wall-E, but its the most satisfying and original non-Pixar CG animated movie to hit screens in a while.<br />On a remote island principality in the mid-Atlantic, the populace have been living on sardines since the canned-fish market dried up. So plucky young scientist Flint Lockwood, inventor of overactive hair-unbalder and spray-on shoes (which you can never remove), commits himself to solving the problem. His answer is a machine which turns water into food, creating anything from sliced pizza to ice cream with toppings. Its a success  until a freak accident happens, the machine goes berserk, and it starts to rain cheeseburgers.<br />The makers of the film are not remotely interested in pop-culture references or celebrity cameos: the voice cast favours stalwarts like Anna Faris and James Caan over inappropriate A-listers. Banishing such petty distractions frees director Phil Lord to focus on more important issues, like story and character: the plot is wonderfully twisty, building to an eyeball-frazzling culinary climax of truly epic proportions. The characters are equally well drawn, from self-absorbed, overambitious doofus Flint to his expressionless but somehow heartbreaking sad-sack dad, Tim. <br />But the films greatest pleasure  and the element that sets it apart from its smarmy, in-jokey predecessors  is its bizarre sense of humour. Fusing snappy one-liners with a kid-friendly seam of slapstick incorporating everything from talking monkeys to homicidal Gummi Bears, the script provokes comparison with comedy from The Marx Brothers to The Mighty Boosh. This sense of unpredictability, coupled with some breathlessly paced and visually stunning action scenes, makes this the animated success of 2009 at least until Up opens next month.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I feel that hes a self-hating Jew, says a childhood friend of Norman Finkelstein, the controversial author of 2000s <i>The Holocaust Industry </i>and a fierce critic of what he considers grief exploitation. Hes certainly a <i>Jew</i>-hating Jew. <br /></p><p>Other voices add to the complexity: an intellectual endorsement from former mentor Noam Chomsky (in a weird Kennedyesque photo, we see the two of them boating); a harsh slam from Harvards Alan Dershowitz, a sustained target of Finkelsteins critiques. Then theres the subject himself, the child of death-camp survivors. Unrepentant at the podium, he brings even mild-mannered Canadians to tears with his anti-Zionist screeds. Hes a bit of a showboat.<br /></p><p>With impressive restraint, the fascinatingly thorny<i> American Radical </i>is less interested in the validity of Finkelsteins ideasseriously mounted, if inflammatoryand more in the topsy-turvy life of todays professional academic. Amazingly, that choice doesnt result in a boring movie: We see student protests at Chicagos DePaul University in 2007 after Finkelstein is denied tenure (hes bounced among five different schools) and sit with the man in the back of a car as he wearily suggests that if his polemics were just about money, hed be smarter to change fields. His own worst enemy, Finkelstein has both trouble and tragic writ large on his brow.<br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The title of Pixars fabulous latest animation gives you its three elegantly dovetailed elements: rodents, food and French. Co-director Jan Pinkavas original idea was sweetly ridiculous  can a naive, ambitious rat (baby-eyed Remy, charmingly voiced by Patton Oswalt), long inspired by his reading of a famous French chefs recipe book, realise his dream to become a chef? This has been turned by its final director, Brad The Incredibles Bird, into one of the most witty, clever, gently moral, dramatically convincing and visually stimulating family entertainments of the year. The animation is extraordinary too, and occasionally breathtaking. Its so enticing, in fact, that card-carrying anti-anthropomorphists like this reviewer can readily accept its big ask: not only <br />a talking rodent but one able to make a celebrity chef out of his hopeless human helpmeet (the docile, disaster-zone Linguini, voiced by Lou Romano) by jerking his hair from inside his hat, like a Pinocchio pulling his masters strings. Its a tribute to the films tonal and directorial control, not to mention its sympathy, detail, intelligence and lack of pretension, that such subtextual sub-currents and metaphors  be they the immigrant experience  la American Tail, digs at McBurger food ethics or the assignation of artistic credit  never obscure its pleasures. Those pleasures are found in its vivid characters (such as its frightening Snow White-style villain, the power-crazed Anton Ego, a food critic with the features of a Gothic Will Self and the voice of Peter OToole), richness of ideas and daring sense of fun. A test for tiny tots, a mite nostalgic and as male-dominated as a modern kitchen it may be, but these are mere quibbles about this delightful addition to the Pixar pantheon.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Fashion is in right now, its appeal to a certain filmgoing demographic rivalled only by that of vampires. Its surprising that the two worlds havent yet collided on screen  Prada by Twilight, anyone? <br />In the meantime, RJ Cutlers documentary nods in that direction: focusing on Anna Wintour, the glacial editor of American Vogue, in the run-up to the publication of the magazines biggest ever September issue, it shows a business in which looks can kill even if fangs arent bared. (When Wintour is obliged to say excuse me to an assistant in her way, you fear the girls days are numbered.) <br />Longtime colleague Grace Coddington, the only person who talks back to her, provides a warmer foil, though the editor herself sometimes seems accessible, even vulnerable: Wintour may be a peerless titan in her field but her family view her work with amused indifference. Consistently funny and engaging, The September Issue is also a window onto the top echelon of an industry in which fanciful escapism is deadly serious.]]></review>

Unwisely, this elegant but altogether airless drama chooses to spend more time on the writer (Valerio Mastandrea), his male mid-life neuroses and crumbling marriage, when the lover character is far more interesting  especially given Golinos outstanding performance. Her work here will be a revelation to some, though the film itself seems to mistake waffly indecision for existential crisis. Cherishable home furnishings, though.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Roman Polanskis last two films, Oliver Twist and The Pianist were solemn affairs, which is unsurprising, considering their stories. But theres often been a playful, comic side to his films, whatever their serious airs. Take a film like Frantic, his 1988 dash around Paris with a frazzled Harrison Ford and a wild Emmanuelle Seigner, and you can almost hear the giggles behind the Hitchcockian curtains. And 1992s Bitter Moon couldnt have been more ridiculously teasing in its charting of relationships between men and women. Even 1976s The Tenant, a spooky study in racial tension and mental disintegration, gave us Polanski wearing lipstick and a dress. Theres little more blackly comic than that.<br />The sniggers from the wings continue with The Ghost, an adaptation of Robert Harriss bold and enjoyable novel that balances political reality with trashy fantasy and which was inspired by the former journalists disappointment with Tony Blair. In Harriss hands, Blair becomes Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan), a slick but empty former prime minister facing trial for war crimes and hiding from the public glare in the United States. The similarities between Blair and Lang are pointed  but the differences are enough that Harris and Polanski get away with placing familiar characters in a tight and tense plot more wild than the dreary reality of high politics. The dreariness is left to the weather.<br />Starting in a wet London, we watch as a green writer (Ewan McGregor, better than usual but struggling with an Estuary accent) is hired to finish Langs memoirs. The last chap died on the job, so theres an ominous mood in the air as he travels to an isolated, modern beach house in a windswept Marthas Vineyard and finds an air of deep discord. Langs wife, Ruth (Olivia Williams, styled with nods to Cherie Blair), is a quietly forceful but sad figure behind the scenes, while Langs relationship with his assistant (Kim Cattrall) is causing tension. When Lang flies to Washington to try to rescue his reputation, his ghost begins to uncover secrets which contradict the Langs version of their past and put him in increasing danger.<br />Unlike, say, The Queen, which delighted in the ordinariness of what goes on behind powerful doors, Harris and Polanski delight in pushing their story beyond the bounds of reality  but never so far that the the film has no relevance. While Brosnans rictus performance is to be grinned at, the fabric of the film is grey, heavy and steely, demanding that we share the ghosts fear and take his peril seriously. As a thriller, the film is cold and lean, and the photography and design convey a strong sense of isolation and a world gone wrong. There are terrific scenes, not least one that involves a sat-nav guiding the action, and the films moody opening and closing scenes are as striking as the image Polanski creates of a weather-beaten coastline seen through the glass wall of Langs office.<br />Theres no escaping some laughable plot turns. Can you really unravel the CIA via Google? But the thread of black humour that runs throughout the film compensates for its occasional moments of madness. Its a film just silly enough to be taken deadly seriously.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In the summer of 2007, for reasons best known to themselves, The White Stripes embarked on a tour of every province and territory in Canada, from the relative balminess of British Columbia to the remote ice-plains of Nunavut, climaxing with a tenth anniversary show, complete with fiddles and bagpipes, in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia. What shines through in Under Great White Northern Lights is Jack and Meg Whites ongoing love for the music they make, and their playful eagerness to inject a touch of surreality into the drab monotony of touring. So we have shows in bowling alleys and town squares, on buses and boats in the harbour, not to mention an awkward meeting with the tribal elders of one far-flung principality. Enjoyment of the film depends a little on ones passion for the music, but even non-believers will warm to its frank, unfussy style and stunning location photography  in shades of black, white and red, natch.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Could this be the best film ever made about a national soup ban? Aardman alumni Sam Fell and Robert Stevenhagen bring old-fashioned fairy tale dynamics and an inviting fireside warmth to this adaptation of the bestselling childrens book by US author Kate DiCamillo. A lengthy prologue sets the scene, where the enquiring mind of ships rat Roscuro (Dustin Hoffman) gets the better of him on Soup Day, and he falls into the queens painstakingly concocted broth and causes her to die on the spot. By decree of the king, both soup and rats are outlawed, which draws a veil of gloom over the land and inadvertently spawns the ugly, underground Ratworld. Its up to tiny mouse, Despereaux (voiced by Matthew Broderick), to revive the fortunes of this once-picturesque township.<br /><br />Stylistically, the film uses brushed, pastel tones to reference classical painting, the most direct example of which is the Arcimboldo-inspired kitchen helper whose body consists of fruit and vegetables. Also, older viewers wont have to rely on another tired barrage of pop-cultural references, beat-boxing squirrels or hackneyed Shrekisms, and can instead grapple with the films surprisingly complex subtexts: ideas of regional conflict, unreasonable abuse of the law and political scaremongering.<br /><br />There are a few problems, mainly with the narrative which keeps doubling-back on itself to introduce new characters. And while its not animated with the breathless pizazz of a Pixar, Despereaux is all the more affecting and dramatically successful for its contemplative pace and measured delivery of information. A lovely film.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The first question to ask about Werner Herzogs jaw-dropping cops-on-crack epic is: why that title? Abel Ferraras 1992 Bad Lieutenant may have made a moderate arthouse splash, largely thanks to Harvey Keitels literally balls-out performance, but it hardly screamed franchise. And while both movies feature drugged-up, sexually voracious cops investigating hideous crimes, in all other aspects these are two entirely separate films. <br />When we first meet Terence McDonagh (Nicolas Cage), hes a fairly decent guy, risking his life to save a drowning man and suffering chronic back damage in the process, a pain which leads directly to his self-medicating downfall. And while the discovery of a murdered immigrant family may provide an opportunity for redemption which chimes with the earlier movie, Herzog and screenwriter William Finkelstein seem entirely indifferent to the ideas of Catholic guilt and salvation which Ferrara explored, just as McDonagh himself seems largely uninterested in solving the crime. This is a movie about morality, but only as far as it serves the crazed characterisation and breathless juggernaut plot. <br />And yet the hijacking of Ferraras title serves the film in unpredictable ways. First, it establishes the kind of seedy, neon-lit milieu in which Herzogs film luxuriates, a devastated post-Katrina New Orleans where normality has been hopelessly compromised. And second, it makes the movie feel cheap and grubby, an unofficial sequel made without the consent of the original director, a true slice of down n dirty outsider trash.<br />And thats exactly what this Bad Lieutenant is: unashamed, all-American junk, a flashback to those great genre movies of the 70s and 80s which managed to entertain an audience, undermine society and score a few sly political points along the way. Cages performance is the engine that drives the film, degenerating from dedicated detective to hoarse, gibbering drug fiend in under two hours. And as he transforms, the movie goes with him, from straight cop drama to screamingly excessive operatic fantasy complete with wild experimental asides and thunderous, balletic violence. <br />Theres never been a movie quite like this before, and there almost certainly never will be again: following its abject failure in the US, its hard to imagine the studos hiring another manic German maverick to helm a cop thriller. But thats exactly why the movie is unmissable: in fusing European experimentalism and Hollywood boldness, Herzog has created a genuine oddity, a furious and unforgettable hybrid which may well prove to be 2010s most purely enjoyable moviegoing experience.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Of all the dysfunctional, sociopathic loners in the long history of cinema, its hard to remember one quite as vicious, belligerent and unpredictable as Sang-hoon, anti-hero of Korean character actor Yang Ik-Junes crackling directorial debut. As played by the director, Sang-hoon is a dizzying, almost comically outrageous human tornado, every other word a curse, every other movement a fist in somebodys face. The impressive thing about Yangs movie is that you care for him.<br />The plot fits squarely into the single man finds companionship against his will template established by US indies like The Station Agent. Whats remarkable is how Yang approaches this potentially hackneyed narrative, balancing scenes of punishing, hyper-realistic violence with moments of sympathetic tenderness and dark, savage humour. Blending a thoughtful cycle-of-violence subplot with a piercing study of how even the most hateful and isolated people inevitably affect those around them, Breathless is a challenging, dynamic experience. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[There is a truly great comedy to be made about religion in modern Britain: the infighting, the backbiting, the doublethink and grandstanding, and of course the ordinary, everyday believers caught in the middle. Close-to-the-bone identity-swap tale The Infidel is not that film  but it comes damn close.<br />Stand-up comic Omid Djalili is Mahmud, a settled, non-practising Muslim family man whose life flips over when he discovers that not only was he adopted, but that his birth parents were orthodox Jews. Eager to learn more about his heritage, Mahmud turns to grouchy Jewish-American cab driver Lenny (Richard Schiff) for guidance.<br />The Infidel starts wonderfully, introducing us to a cast of carefully constructed stereotypes and then just as carefully it undermines them. Mahmud and Lenny are a terrific odd couple: theres a real bromantic spark between Djalili and Schiff, both of whom clearly relish the opportunity to tackle taboo subjects headon. David Baddiels script is sharp, wise and very funny, and never flinches from exposing the hypocrisy and power games that fuel religious intolerance.<br />But the film struggles to maintain this high standard. An intriguing but underdeveloped subplot concerning the marriage of Mahmuds son to the adopted daughter of a fundamentalist preacher begins to take over, pushing poor Lenny into the background and breaking up the perfectly pitched buddy dynamic that fuelled the earlier scenes. And gradually, inevitably, it drifts into worthiness: Baddiel doesnt just want us to laugh, he wants us to learn. And here lies the films downfall, as what began as a smart, challenging exercise in boundary pushing becomes just another sentimental life lesson.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This is one of those rare occasions where the sequel is better than the original  but only by a whisker. In the first instalment, Alex the dancing lion and his mismatched cohorts escaped from a New York zoo on a mission to reach Africa. They missed and wound up on Madagascar instead. Roll on part two and Alex (voice of Ben Stiller) et al are on board a home-made aircraft bound for Africa where they hope finally to meet members of their own species. The film then shatters into a trillion plotlets involving reunions, rites of passage, water shortages, volcanic sacrifices, even a little romantic interaction. Yet, despite this splintered storyline, the film manages to remain more coherent than the last. The animation, too, is improved. Great pre-Chrimbo fun for under-tens, then, but a chore for anyone else. Tip: for best results, see it in gigantiscope at the IMAX.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its been more than a decade since Justin Kerrigans debut, Human Traffic, and the Welsh director finally returns to cinemas with with this sparky, moving and very personal film that draws on his own memories of growing up in the 1980s. Most dads are heroes in the eyes of their boys, even if everyone else thinks theyre raving lunatics, and thats the idea explored in this clever and sensitive film about Charlie (Robert Carlyle), a spiv-like figure who darts about his rundown Welsh neighbourhood in 1988 as if hes being chased by an unknown enemy and confides in his 11-year-old son Jamie (Arron Fuller) that hes working for the Secret Services. That hes probably not Port Talbots answer to 007 is clear early on, but Kerrigan is brave enough to allow the truth to emerge gradually over an entire film.<br />All of which leaves the director ample room to explore at close quarters, and from a peculiar and rewarding perspective, the relationship between this father and son. Its a film told largely through careful performances, and Fuller is excellent as the boy, capturing both the wide-eyed, loyal acceptance of a young son who wants to believe anything and everything his father says and the protective instinct of a child of a vulnerable parent. Carlyle, meanwhile, gives one of his best performances as the troubled and hyperactive father, further proving that he has excellent taste when picking smaller British films (Summer, The Unloved). Modest in means but rich in warmth, its an eminently likeable film and all credit to Kerrigan for finding a new way of exploring the age-old story of dads and their boys.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Audiences know what theyre getting with the annual Big Disney Christmas Movie: heroic kids, evil adults, and a bumbling hero caught somewhere in between. This years chump is Adam Sandler, essaying his usual bipolar man-child schtick as Skeeter Bronson, the handyman at a grand hotel built on the site of the Mom n Pop motel where he grew up, who is nonplussed when the tales he concocts for his niece and nephew begin to have eerie parallels in real life.<br />Bedtime Stories starts well, with Sandlers naturally acerbic persona and wilfully erratic turns from Guy Pearce and Russell Brand serving to offset the scripts more schmaltzy moments. But it descends into pathos, undermined by an insipid romantic subplot and the usual platitudinous guff about self-belief. Insult is added to injury by a series of reactionary, misinformed anti-eco gags and a distressing but inevitable cameo from Rob Schneider as a Native American.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Click here to read a interview with director Campion</i><br />Not a great deal happens in Bright Star, Jane Campions breezy and beautiful film about the nineteenth-century British poet John Keats (played by Ben Whishaw). The New Zealand directors film is light in the most attractive and dreamy of ways: it floats on its own, intimately explored love story and refuses to be weighed down by either period fixtures and fittings or the later reputation of Keats, whose final years and stalling romance with his neighbour Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish) Campion handles with a smartness and sensitivity that feel teasingly throwaway.<br /><br />Thats not to say theres anything slapdash about Campions story of how Keats moved in next door to the fatherless Brawne family and fell in love with slightly younger Fanny, tentatively courting her and writing her wonderfully honest letters but fatally kept at a distance by poverty and illness. In fact, for this critic, its the exquisite detail of the whole affair, coupled with the aerating winds of modernity that blow gently through the film, rather than the emotional pull of the doomed love affair at its heart, that are the films real success. (Others, I must say, differ on this point, judging by the sobs and sniffles to my left and right at the London Film Festival screening of the film.) <br />A combination of unstuffy dialogue, wise casting, unselfconscious performances and sensuous but never pretty photography makes Campions version of the nineteenth century feel current but not anachronistic.<br />Campion came to Keatss story, which she shot in Britain last year, after a four-year sabbatical from filmmaking  and it shows, especially following the dark, oppressive atmosphere of In the Cut, one of her least successful films. Her telling of this biographical tale, inspired by Andrew Motions biography, feels as if its told by someone with much knowledge but little weight on their shoulders. Its a feeling one gets from the performances too, especially from Cornish and Whishaw, who both, at times, threaten to float off on a cloud of their characters distraction. Its down to the side players, especially an earthy Kerry Fox as Fannys mother and a boisterous Paul Schneider as Keatss friend and protector Charles Brown, to give the film some vim away from the fog of love. Whishaw, with his troubled air and vulnerable features, is perhaps better as a Romantic lead than a romantic one, and if the film has one crucial failing, its that theres a crucial spark missing between Whishaw and Cornish. <br />Campion treats Keatss talent as a given and not a cue for creaky explorations of inspiration and artistic otherness. She weaves his poetry into the drama, calling for it to be spoken naturally and not at all awkwardly by her characters. Its not easy to follow verse this way, but it certainly inspires the viewer to head straight from the cinema to the bookshop.<br /><i>Click here to read a interview with director Campion</i><br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It makes a change to see a 3D animated kids film that doesnt poke your eyes out with fancy effects just for the sake of it. In fact, some of the 3D elements in Blue Skys latest prehistoric critter circus are so subtle you may not notice them. What you wont miss are the films exhilarating action sequences and electrifyingly vibrant palette.<br /><br />Some dramatic changes are occurring in the lives of Manny the mammoth, Sid the sloth and Diego the sabre-toothed tiger. Manny is preoccupied with a pregnant partner, Diegos lost his mojo and is having a midlife crisis, and lisping loser Sid well, is it any wonder he doesnt have a family of his own? Following a minor tiff, Sid wanders off, falls through the ice and discovers three dinosaur eggs which he adopts  until big mama Rex comes trundling into the frame. In a nod to Journey to the Centre of the Earth, the rest unfolds in a Cretaceous underworld where Manny and Co  aided by a cocky new weasel character  attempt an audacious rescue. <br />Some have expressed displeasure at the design and voices of the leads. I disagree  but I do think Simon Peggs Artful Dodger-like weasel is a vocal clich too far. Similarly, some of the anarchic, comical segues featuring Scrat the squirrel and a newfound love are beginning to feel overfamiliar. As with the two earlier films, its all a mite disorderly in tempo but often highly amusing and great fun in the main.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For his third feature, no-fi auteur Andrew Bujalski delves into the lives of yet another cluster of upwardly mobile twentysomething hipster types as they feign understanding of each others problems while anxiously trying to keep their own lives on point. Adopting the same muted approach to drama as his previous films (Funny Ha Ha and Mutual Appreciation), Beeswax revolves around a trifling dispute between the patrons of a vintage clothing store in Austin, Texas as the slyly combative Amanda (Anne Dodge) plans to take the partially disabled Jeanie (Tilly Hatcher) to court. More than ever, Bujalski comes across like the natural heir to someone like Eric Rohmer, an artist who creates intricate, perceptive and artful cinema that rejects unnecessary style and contrivance. Also like Rohmer, this is a film about how language lacks the capabilities to convey the complexity of human feeling and that we have to look beyond what characters are saying to decode their thoughts and intentions.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Emerging from the same Liverpool European Capital of Culture scheme that gave us Terence Daviess Of Time and City and the horror film Salvage (set on Brookside Close!), director Lindy Heymanns promising if uneven feature debut is a low-budget drama about two young women (Kerrie Hayes and Nichola Burley) who push their obsession with a footballer (Jamie Doyle) beyond waiting for him at the ground and staring at his swish city apartment. Hayes and Burley (who struts her stuff in StreetDance 3D) both offer spirited performances, but, if Heymann and writer Leigh Campbell had resisted the hard-to-swallow hysterics and gunplay of the third act, this could have been a more credible exploration of teenage sexual infatuation and celebrity obsession. Whats most alluring, though, on an intimate scale, is how far Heymann tries to tell her story not through talk but through physical observation and music (even if she relies on a lot of Ladytron). And the sensitive cinematography of young Spaniard Edouard Grau, who shot A Single Man, is a highlight.]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[Lebanon]]></name>
      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[Strange to say it, but Lebanon is this weeks second-best Israeli film (see also Eyes Wide Open'). Its also the picture that won the Golden Lion at last years Venice Film Festival, putting it up there with the likes of The Battle of Algiers, Rashomon and, more recently, Vera Drake and Brokeback Mountain. The comparison may not be entirely fair, but such an award does raise expectations and its worth warning that while Samuel Maozs Lebanon is to be recommended as a distinctive, personal memoir of what it was like to be a young, fearful soldier and inhabit the hellish confines of a tank during the 1982 Lebanon War, its also a patchy, difficult work that often feels oddly academic and distant rather than truly surprising and involving. <br />Which is not to say that Lebanon isnt an interesting experiment, not least in how to recreate war on a low budget and to avoid the predictable narratives, back stories and emotional flashpoints of so many conflict tales. Maoz plunges us straight into the action at 3am on June 6 1982, the first day of the Lebanon war as Israel invades its neighbour. The first and last shots of the film show us the exterior of the tank, but the rest of the narrative is set entirely within the vehicle, only showing us the situation outside through its periscope. As formal handcuffs go, these are tight  but I couldnt help feeling that Maoz cheats at his own game a little. His viewfinder is strangely attuned to giving us emotive money shots, be they of a dying donkeys nostrils still breathing or a naked woman running around among bombed-out ruins.<br />Inside the tank, though, his vision of hell is truly effective. Claustrophobia, part-knowledge, confrontation and an eerie sense of isolation are the name of the game as the tank encounters gun and rocket fire, negotiates a ruined town by day and night and suffers damage of increasing severity. Comradeship barely figures as the tanks occupants  three young lads, Shmulik (Yoav Donat), Hertzel (Oshri Cohen) and Yigal (Michael Moshonov), under the command of the not-much-older Assi (Itay Tiran)  are driven by the individualism of fear. Heroism and self-sacrifice, so often the twin clichs of war films, are irrelevant. Barely emerging from the shadows, the four men negotiate smoke, oil, water and urine  not to mention an abundance of croutons (their issued snack) sprayed over the festering walls of the tank. <br />Lebanon is a film of randomly emerging episodes, some more successful than others. A sequence in which the tank confronts an armed man holding a family hostage feels contrived and designed too obviously as a moment of terror, while Yigals request that his superiors call his parents to assure them hes safe feels similarly misjudged. Two stronger sequences stick in the mind: Shmuliks inability to pull the trigger when faced with an enemy for the first time and the tanks reckless, nocturnal drive through the city.<br />Lebanon treads similar territory to Ari Folmans Waltz with Bashir, another work from a filmmaker who fought in the Lebanon War and is only now able to distil his memories into entertainment. But Maoz prefers straight, undignified reconstruction to telling a story through the prism of memory. His aim is admirable, his project intriguing and his film a fair testament to the nightmare of war  but it never feels as convincing or as suffocating as it should.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Heres another pathologically pleasant melodrama from Lasse Hallstrm (Hachi: A Dogs Tale); this one is adapted from a weepy by Nicholas Sparks, author of The Notebook and Nights in Rodanthe, so comes infected with a fatal strain of Sunday school sanctimony. Its an elegantly doomed love story with Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia!): a couple so wholesomely, handsomely American they ought to come with a made-by-Mattel stamp.<br />He is a soldier on leave from the Green Berets visiting his awkward coin-collecting dad; shes a student. They meet on a beach in South Carolina. Cue a two-week romance filmed something like a feminine hygiene advert: sunshiny and breezy, his bronzed beefcake chest, her lithe limbs. Theres some coy intimate relations and seriously articulate lets-make-the-world-a-better place chats. She tells him she wants to set up a summer camp for kids with autism; hes only got a year left to serve. They promise to write. Its all looking peachy. At which point you expect one of them to pipe up: Gee, arent we meant to be, like, elegantly doomed or something?<br />Enter 9/11, rudely upsetting the course of true love. He re-enlists for another tour, she waits. War, death, illness, this film has its fair share of all three. Which, never mind anything so complicated as grief or post-traumatic stress, provide ample opportunity for great swells of goodness and beatific smiles; even the Dear John letter of the title is written in an act of heroic self-sacrifice. A sucker for a cheap sob, it left me cold.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This dumb and mostly fun fish-out-of-water comedy would be more dumb and much less fun if it wasnt for some amusing casting and a punchy running time that acknowledges the limits of its script. Tina Fey and Steve Carell are Claire and Phil Foster, a married New Jersey couple with a damp sex life and a damper social diary who decide that a date night away from the kids is well overdue. But when Phil, in a moment of unusual boldness, steals the reservation of the mysterious Triplehorns in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, they find themselves the unlikely target of gangsters headed by a self-mocking Ray Liotta. The script is lowest-common-denominator stuff  mistaken identity, car chases, strip clubs, boat rides  but the rapport between Carell and Fey is easy to warm to and an episode involving a shirtless Mark Wahlberg as an old friend of Claires who challenges Phils uneasy masculinity provokes genuine laughs. Fey and Carell are better than this, but when the other options in the action-romcom territory include such efforts as The Bounty Hunter, whos complaining?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A film about multiple personalities that is more than a little troubled. Forensic psychiatrist Dr Cara Jessup (Julianne Moore), a doctor of science and a woman of God, is dedicated to debunking the myth of multiple-personality disorders. Her testimonies have sent murderers to their deaths, so she is intrigued when her father, a shrink, invites her to consider the fractured mind of a new patient, Adam (Jonathan Rhys Myers). Not even the random murder of her husband could shake Jessups belief in science and her faith in God, but Adams dislocated mind comes close. Suddenly, rationality gives way to doubt, as Jessup starts to believe that Adams alternate personalities are murder victims, connected in some way to an early-twentieth-century flu epidemic, some devil-worshipping mountain gypsies and a false prophet. Moore and Rhys-Meyers act as if theyre possessed, but no one can arrest the films slide into noisy, supernatural nonsense.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>British viewers can only witness  and not fully appreciate  Michael Moores Sicko, so strongly is his latest slice of peppy agitprop intended for folk in his own land. This cant be stressed too much. For if anyone in these isles mistook Moores new film for a balanced, erudite essay on the American healthcare system , they could rightly accuse Moore of distortion, self-aggrandisement, emotional blackmail and all the other qualities that weve come to know  and love  from Moores particular brand of filmmaking. As it is, you suspect that Sicko has all these elements in droves, yet still youre glad that the film exists and may even find yourself cheering or shedding a tear at its more demagogic moments. Its only later, when you emerge into the light, that you find yourself hurriedly adjusting your trousers and a small amount of guilt starts to flow.</p><p>Sicko is a quieter, more focused and less feral beast than its predecessor, Fahrenheit 9/11, but thats not saying much. Moore takes 50 minutes to lumber into view, which, on a first viewing of the film, I took for a new modesty. Most probably, though, Moores early absence  the voiceover is very much his own  is for other reasons; he must find it more difficult to film in public these days.</p><p>One also wonders: has he come to depend more heavily now on other interviewers and researchers than his own legwork? Whatever the methods, the point of the film is a strong one, well-made: the profit-motive of American health insurance is killing people. Moore sidesteps the issue of millions of Americans not even being able to afford proper insurance and instead fires unease straight into the heart of employed, financially comfortable, secure middle-America. Moore presents case after case of those who have suffered from insurance companies finding ways to wriggle out of the deal. Hes good on the underlying values of the system too, offering an amusing episode in which he traces the roots of the reds-under-the-bed fears against socialised medicine, even tracking down a 12-inch record that Ronald Reagan made to help the cause.</p><p>Its when Moore crosses the pond and starts to compare the American situation with the perceived Nirvana of the British and French systems that any European viewer will have to start biting their tongue and chanting: this is meant for less-intelligent Americans, less-intelligent Americans, less-intelligent Americans . . . for whom the entire concept of free healthcare was always demonised as a Soviet method of mind-control. Of course, as we know, our NHS has its own problems, but theyre not Moores concern: why ruin a good rant? Mostly, Moore keeps to his simple, but important, task of comparing the benefits of government-run healthcare with that operated by private enterprise and destroying some popular myths about socialised medicine. The films worst chapters come at the end with two very stupid stunts, one involving a trip to Cuba and another involving Moore footing the medical bill for the wife of a vocal critic.So familiar now is Moores heavy-handed style of persuasion that when a film called Manufacturing Dissent arrived in our cinemas last week and accused him of distorting one of the central thrusts of Roger &amp; Me, his film about unemployment in Flint, most critics were willing to shrug their shoulders with a resounding, Aw, shucks. We shouldnt be so complacent: a good cause doesnt justify iffy means. Yet you would have to be very naive to watch Moores films, this one included (which is less obviously wild and hysterical), and not see through his methods. In fact, thats part of the pleasure; a groan here, a heartfelt nod there. And, for us Brits at least, Sicko is worth it just for the sight of Moore wandering around Hammersmith Hospital looking for the cash till.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Todd Solondz is still perhaps best known for Happiness, the awkward yet affecting story of an extended New Jersey family, and one of the few recent movies to feature a father-son heart-to-heart about paedophilia. Life During Wartime picks up the story a decade on. The characters are the same but the actors different: when child rapist Bill, played then by Dylan Baker and now by Ciarn Hinds, is released from prison, his wife Trish (Allison Janney) and sons try to deal with the fallout; her sisters Joy (Shirley Henderson) and Helen (Ally Sheedy), meanwhile, wrangle with dead lovers and the vagaries of Hollywood. Solondzs ongoing interests in young adolescence and social taboos ensure some shocks but his underlying interests are sincere and humane: the consequences of trauma, the capacity for self-delusion, the possibility of change and the necessity of forgiveness.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It all started in a dentists waiting room in France, with a magazine feature on a New York construction whose twin towers would absolutely dwarf the Eiffel Tower. The teenage Philippe Petit was so entranced, he ripped the article out and stuck it up his jumper. He dreamed right then of walking on a wire between what would become the two towers of the World Trade Center, and, in 1974, he actually did it.<br />Just how this act of graceful insanity came to pass is chronicled in Marshs captivating documentary, which intercuts the build-up and execution of the walk itself with Petits remarkable backstory. This was no spur-of-the-moment fluke, but the result of years of globe-trotting preparation with a support group of like-minded individuals, each of whom pop up in interviews to express awe-struck concern for their fearless leader. Petit himself twinkles here too, exuding such voluble Gallic esprit that he could hold us in his spell for 90 minutes on his own.<br />Not that seeing the man himself detracts from the palm-slicking suspense the film develops as the mission hits almost surreal snags even before the soon-to-be-famous funambulist steps out on to the thinnest thread. Nor, indeed, does the absence of surviving locations knock Marsh off his stride as he contrives sequences of playful dramatic fakery to sustain the tension. Although some viewers may find the too-familiar Michael Nyman cues and over-used Erik Satie pianism a disappointingly earthbound musical accompaniment, for the most part theres storytelling magic here which makes the film so much bigger than just some expert BBC-funded reconstruction. Theres no mention of the buildings subsequent fate; instead, a generous, visionary gesture supplanting the communal memory of the sites unspeakable horrors with an image of human achievement thats head-spinning, heart-leaping in its absurd purity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[I hope your kids have bad influences and develop bad personalities, says the well-to-do dad of three suburban young adults as a putdown in the mysterious, bold Dogtooth, hinting at a unique approach to parenting of which Josef Fritzl would be proud. Director Giorgos Lanthimos gives us a middle-class Greek family, lorded over by a businessman father who keeps his three children within the walls of their smart home and teaches them the incorrect definitions of several new words each day (A motorway is a very strong wind). These kids world is without outside interference: when their mother talks on the phone, they think shes speaking to herself; when planes fly over, they think theyre toys. Perhaps the dads biggest mistake is to allow a security guard from work to enter their home and sexually satisfy his son. He doesnt bargain on her trading gifts and ideas with his daughter for sexual favours. Nor does he pre-empt the danger of her lending his daughter videos of Rocky and Flashdance.<br />With hints of Hanekes The Seventh Continent, Ian McEwans The Cement Garden and even Lord of the Flies, Lanthimos has crafted a stunningly provocative and at times witty play on the inspirations that make us who we are. All families live by their own rules, and this drama takes that idea to its perverse and shocking conclusion. Lanthimos films these calamities in a quiet, observational style, with calm colours, subtle camera movements and gentle edits, lending an air of normality to a world that couldnt be less so. Special and troubling.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The Manchurian Candidate raises the same red flags today as it did in the early 1960s, when its story of political intrigue and assassination became all too relevant following the death of JFK, causing the films abrupt disappearance from screens. Re-released to coincide with the current election campaign, it remains a nightmarish tale of high-level subterfuge, mental manipulation and the futility of one mans rebellion against an ingrained social system. <br />In one of his last roles as a genuine actor before he was swallowed by shallow fame, Frank Sinatra stars as disturbed Korean war veteran Bennett Marco, who uncovers a plot to murder a presidential frontrunner. One of the first films to voice the growing belief that the American system of power and privilege was corrupt, it prefigures not just the Kennedy and King murders, but Vietnam, Watergate and the entire 70s conspiracy boom. More importantly, its a sensational piece of genre filmmaking: pacy, compelling, witty and cynical, it depicts, in unflinching detail, the beginning of the end for post-war American optimism.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Humans land a raw deal when it comes to animations. We upright, two-legged creatures regularly have to give way to the superior intelligence or endless fascination of a deer or a dog or a penguin. Its part of the bargain: we draw them, they make us look stupid. <br />And so it is with Wall-E, except this time we have only ourselves to blame. Pixar has drawn inspiration for this bold, bleak and often very beautiful film from the worst approximations of the future were shaping for our planet.<br /><br />In Pixars last film, Ratatouille, it was a sewer rat who brilliantly grabbed our attention and revolutionised French cuisine. For Wall-E, humans again take a back seat, and its a robot with a cube for a belly and binoculars for eyes whos bleeping for our love. When we do, finally, encounter humans  living on a self-sufficient spaceship, waited on by robots, sucking on straws  theyre fat, sedentary, greedy and unpleasant. <br />Plus a change: from Cruella de Vil to our fellow folk in Happy Feet, cartoons have always held a mirror up to our selfish instincts.This time its 2700, and weve polluted ourselves out of existence. The only humans left live a sterile, bloated life high above earth, where we decamp for the second, more frenetic and less inspired half of the film. But everything that comes before is magical. The only animate object left in the lifeless, rust-coloured, dusty landscape of urban desolation that we used to call earth is one tireless mechanical waste-collector called Wall-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter  Earth Class). He lives in a cluttered container and spends his days buzzing about, piling up junk to look like skyscrapers or Mayan temples and sucking up sun for his solar panels. His only company is a lonesome cockroach.<br /><br />So thats one robot, a cockroach and a vision of earth gone to pot. This is a cartoon that offers an uncompromising, imaginative, angry portrait of the future. Its daring in its simplicity: for the first 40 minutes, we watch in wonder as Wall-E goes about his business in near silence; its the sharp intelligence of the detail, always so painstakingly rendered, that most amazes. At one point, Wall-E finds an abandoned diamond ring in a jewellery box. What does he do with it? He throws away the ring and plays with the hinges of the container. Of course he does: hinges should fascinate more than precious minerals. Shame on us for not realising that before.<br /><br />By rights, Wall-E shouldnt be cute in the Bambi or Dumbo sense of the word: hes battered and fading and the only noises he makes are computerised drawls not dissimilar to ETs limited lingo. But Wall-E is alluring, and not because hes got big eyes or dangling eyelashes but because hes smart, hard-working, with a romantic side, and is hopelessly addicted to watching clips of Michael Crawford and Barbra Streisand in Gene Kellys Hello Dolly! on a video screen. Hes everything we should have been if we hadnt put all our energy into destroying the planet. <br />But none of this is preachy or obvious. <br />Environmental destruction is only the breathtaking backdrop to the film and its more the minimalism of Wall-Es existence that fascinates. By the time a sleeker, feminine robot called Eve  who looks like an iPod shaped into a pepper-pot  arrives, were craving her company in sympathy with our mechanised friend. Pixar has done it again. I wonder a little what kids will make of the long silence of the first half followed by the disorienting mania of the second, but theres nothing here thats not wonderfully imagined and lovingly presented.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The latest from Studio Ghibli is a mini epic by Goro (son of Hayao) Miyazaki adapted from the work of Ursula K Le Guin. An admirable if uneven affair, it rejects humour and whimsy to tell its story of rival sorcerers locked in battle over the secret of eternal life and a young prince facing up to the responsibilities of adulthood. As usual, the hand-drawn animation is quietly lavish and a reliance on old-fashioned narrative progression makes a refreshing change from the many US animal-based digital knock-offs that too often feel like strings of unrelated gags. But as with 2005s Howls Moving Castle, a desire to over-egg the source novels contemporary relevance  in this case, environmental devastation  leaves things quickly overwhelmed by mawkish sentiment. Hardly a groundbreaking work, then, but still a worthy addition to the singular Ghibli canon.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Before Ghost Town was released in the US, writer-director David Koepp suggested that he had doubts whether Ricky Gervais would be able to carry the project. Its an odd remark, especially when Gervais is the last person who should be blamed for the films failings. Assuming his usual guise as the jittery, acid-tongued malcontent, he excels as a dentist with the Groucho-esque moniker of Bertram Pincus. He dies for seven minutes during a colonoscopy and, on leaving hospital, is able to see members of NYCs dead who have business to attend to in the land of the living. The spirit of a city slicker played by Greg Kinnear railroads him into stopping his graceful other half (Ta Leoni) marrying a smug lawyer, but when Pincus gets to know her, well, you can guess the rest <br />Its not unlikeable  but no effort has been made to make anything more of the Scrooge-comes-good model. Gervaiss sweetly pathetic performance masks many of the failings of the by-the-book quirky direction and workaday script, but Leoni is decent as the romantic foil  and Kinnears slimy-everyman act works well. Enjoyable as it is to see Gervais trying (and often succeeding) to make something of the mediocre dialogue, its not enough.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When Cormac McCarthys brutal saga of post-apocalyptic angst won the Pulitzer Prize in 2007, a big screen adaptation became inevitable. Whether or not this was a good idea seemed irrelevant: it was a bestselling book with a timely, inherently cinematic theme; the movie had to be made. <br /> The Proposition director John Hillcoats film is as direct and unflinching an adaptation as one could reasonably hope for. A man (Viggo Mortensen) and a boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee) wander the American wasteland after an unnamed ecological disaster. The trees are bare, the animals dead, the few human survivors starving, desperate, often violent, occasionally monstrous.The Road is certainly the bleakest and potentially the least commercial product in recent Hollywood history. Both book and movie suffer from the same inherent weakness  they exist purely to make you miserable. Sure, theres a smattering of subtext  a little eco-politics here, a spot of family psychology there  but the central purpose is to break your heart and shatter your soul.<br />On which level, Hillcoats movie is a resounding triumph. Stunning landscape photography sets the melancholy mood, and Nick Caves wrenching score reinforces it. But it is the performances that ultimately hold the film together. We expect this kind of selfless professionalism from Mortensen, and McPhee is appropriately sad-eyed as his long-suffering son, but its the incidental characters who steal the show, notably Robert Duvall in a startling cameo which not only distils the films key themes into a single three-minute scene, but singlehandedly lifts a potentially drab affair into something quietly impressive. Just dont expect to walk out smiling.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Capitalisms knack of rewarding the innovative while penalising the vulnerable is the central theme of this spry comedy from British director Ben Hopkins about a small-time gamble gone sour. Its set in 1994 and takes place in a string of villages near the Turkey/Azerbaijan border. Tayan Ayaydin plays luckless Mihram, an independent, charismatic blackmarket trader who sees potential for a payout in a request from a clinic to smuggle pharmaceuticals into Turkey, and far from being the altruistic soul his wife perceives, he plans to boost his capital by folding in other business. There are moments when Hopkins loses sight of the drama in his attempt to construct an economic case study, but the film is full of enough humour, charm and intelligence to forgive it this minor sin.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Although made for television and already transmitted on C4, actress Samantha Mortons directorial debut definitely has a cinematic feel. Long unflinching takes, imposing frontal compositions and expressive use of colour and sound mark this portrait of the institutional care which fails 11-year-old Lucy (Molly Windsor, pictured) after she can no longer live with her estranged parents (Robert Carlyle, Susan Lynch). Given Mortons own troubled personal history, theres obviously an autobiographical element here, yet its remarkable how she sublimates any residual anger into the films sombre and sincere accumulation of detail, which illustrates camaraderie and rebellion, unwitting neglect and  sadly  manipulative abuse within the clinical environs of a Nottingham childrens home. Windsors taciturn and stoic central performance is both haunting and affecting, framed by Mortons deliberate, even stately direction. Thankfully though, this isnt a conventional film, but a campaigning document, an act of solidarity and a bold, emotionally piercing personal statement.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Why make a kiddie movie about investment banking? Especially when it suggests that the perpetrators of the credit crunch were spending too little  not too much  time listening to their seven year olds. Thats exactly what Denver exec Eddie Murphy does in this dreadfully flat family comedy, since the financial advice of his daughter (Yara Shahidi, a natural) and her imaginary friends rather spookily outdoes his own market soothsaying. Needless to say, he becomes reliant on her suggestions, with consequences that leave yawning gaps between anything even vaguely resembling a half-smile, as the plot grinds its way towards some chastening lessons for workaholic daddy.<br /><br />Murphy at least tries to stay in character rather than overdoing the silly voices and physical knockabout, but maybe the material was so blah that he felt it wasnt worth the effort. So there you have it, a movie in which the innocence of a child helps her parent become a better capitalist, all to the strains of sundry Beatles covers. Does one detect just the teeniest hint of cynicism? <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its tempting to see this debut feature from the creators of The Office and Extras as a case of poachers turned gamekeepers: all those gags about pop culture and Hollywood, then they go and make a straight-down-the-line coming-of-age yarn, set in the most romantically realised version of 1973 Reading you could imagine. In fact, the seeds were always there: the confidently sustained story, the build-up of emotional resonance and the parochial aspirationalism that characterise Cemetery Junction are all of a piece with the writer-directors sitcom work.<br />The film focuses on three lifelong pals entering adulthood: Bruce (Tom Hughes) is all swaggering bravado; Snork (Tom Doolan) is a clown, alternately arrogant and naively inane; and apprentice insurance salesman Freddie (Christian Cooke) is knuckling down to a life of bourgeois comfort he hasnt quite sold himself on yet. He finds a kindred spirit in childhood crush Julie (Felicity Jones), whose slimy dad (Ralph Fiennes) and fianc (Matthew Goode)  Freddies boss and mentor at the insurance firm  have decidedly lower opinions of her potential.<br />There are laughs, but this isnt quite a comedy. Gervais and Merchant have stated their intention to make a classically cool movie along the lines of Saturday Night Fever or Rebel Without a Cause and they get away with it up to a point. Rather than sniggeringly naff, their 70s suburbia is handsomely designed and lit, with attractive, engaging kids undergoing unabashedly emotional life-changes.<br /><br />Its not a wholly convincing fit: though confidently executed, the film often leans heavily enough on its models to feel formulaic, and its romances map a little too closely on to those of The Office. Overall, though, its refreshing to see a mainstream British film with the ambition to strut its stuff on studio terms. Aspirational indeed.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In 1937, facing an advancing Japanese army, the Chinese government withdrew from the then capital Nanking (now known as Nanjing). Although some in Japan still dispute the facts, the ensuing occupation saw the Japanese military shooting many thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians and committing rape on a massive scale, while the populace took refuge in the diplomatic quarter. Filmed in black-and-white on huge sets recreating the bomb-blasted city, Lu Chuans dramatised account lacks nothing in vividness, elaborating the scale of the atrocities through witnesses on both sides. With a key role for a Japanese soldier disgusted by the carnage, the film discerns the humanity of patriots and enemy alike, though the emphasis is on the heroic sacrifices of the Chinese. Even if the characterisation is a shade too generic to engage the emotions, and its hard to respond to savagery on this scale, the fact that these events are being brought to light with such care makes this a significant film  though not a great one.]]></review>

Perhaps the biggest mistake is to have made Eliza a writer: working motherhood is always fraught, but the profession where you open your laptop once the rugrats are out of the way is easier than many. <br />But frankly, I wouldnt care if she was at the epicentre of the movement for global peace: shes a happily married mother who looks like Uma Thurman, and my reserves of sympathy are limited.]]></review>

But none can hold a candle to Chris Thrash, hero of 'The Rock-Afire Explosion', whose fascination with the titular animatronic rock band â fixtures in every small-town Showbiz Pizza Place restaurant back in the '80s â forms the central thread of this tender, lightweight but strangely moving documentary. A tale of squandered wealth, uncertain love and the overwhelming power of nostalgia, this is a film packed with everyday pathos and moments of unexpected, heartwrenching beauty.]]></review>

Here, were in that gone-to-pot near-future so beloved of filmmakers, where Law and Whitaker (pictured) are pals and colleagues working in a debt-recovery department with a difference: they recover human organs. The film pitches friend against friend as Law ends up with a new ticker and darts about town with fellow post-op target Alice Braga in tow. Ideas, excitement and logic are ditched in favour of blood and gore  and theres no fun to be had watching operations and knife fights. Law and Whitaker are disastrous in the lead roles. Its a dreary and violent film that betrays its three years spent on the shelf.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[At first glance, Bananas!* seems like just the latest in a long line of agit-prop docs warning consumers off their favourite foodstuffs. Opening scenes of desolate Nicaraguan villages and downtrodden workers only reinforce this impression. Then were introduced to Juan J Dominguez, a sparkly-toothed LA legal eagle who drives a Ferrari, has a bust of Caesar on his desk and speaks passionately of his feelings towards the little guy, and matters become more unpredictable. Essentially, Bananas!* (theres no clue given as to what the asterisk signifies) is a David and Goliath legal drama, following Juan and his colleagues as they bring a case against food giant Dole for the mistreatment of Nicaraguan workers in the late 70s. Its a low-budget, off-the-cuff affair, relying largely on grainy court footage and to-camera interviews, and is probably better suited to TV than the big screen. But there are moments of real suspense, and the films intentions  to publicise the still-raging workers battle  is a noble one.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Despite being recognised as one of the better 007 films (and one laudably devoid of what would later become the formulaic Bond ending), number two in the series actually proves marginally less memorable than many of the others. Maybe weve become too accustomed to the big finales, the fast cars, the gadgets, the striking locations and the caricature villains  the very tics that have defined every Bond film over the years. For this fan, the most evocative moment turns out to be Matt Monroes honeyed larynx over the closing-credits sequence. The elaborate spy-caper story boils down to Connerys MI6 agent getting embroiled in an Istanbul-set plot to steal a decoding device from the Russians. Lotte Lenyas leery lesbian, Robert Shaws Aryan-esque assassin and Daniela Bianchis ditzy double agent are gratifying side shows but the film lacks the exotic, colourful flamboyance of the best of its successors. So shoot me.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One vital plot point of Safy Nebbous otherwise slick and thoughtful thriller is hard to believe  but then, in the midst of doubt, one remembers that a true story inspired the film. So where does that leave those worries about the overall credibility? Rather than undermining it, such niggles add an additional layer of intrigue to a film that trades in almost supernatural ideas of motherhood. Elsa (Catherine Frot) is troubled: the mother of a small boy, shes going through a divorce and the concerns of her parents suggest she has a history of depression and breakdowns. <br />When she spots a familiar young girl at the party of one her sons friends, she is adamant the child is the baby thought to have died in a hospital fire days after Elsa gave birth. Elsa keeps her feelings to herself but makes friends with the girls wealthy mother, Claire (Sandrine Bonnaire), a pretty young woman whose light presence is in strict contrast to Elsas increasing mania as she turns from Claires new pal to her omnipresent stalker.<br /><br />Nebbou quietly marshals claustrophobia and tension without encroaching on more bombastic thriller territory. Hes well-served by two actresses who play up to the subtlety of their roles as written: Frot is pleasingly hard to read, so were never sure on which side of reason her behaviour falls, while Bonnaire gradually allows a growing sense of unease into her portrait of a woman who superficially has it all. To discuss the film any more could ruin it, but needless to say it should inspire heated conversation among any who see it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Building a drama around a stand-up comedian is a risky prospect: theres always a chance the audience is going to want more of the comedy and less of the soul searching and self-loathing that goes with the job. And they dont come more redemption-ready than Scots shock comic Joey Frisk (Stephen McCole, pictured), who might be successful if his coke habit, six-year-old daughter and creepy old schoolfriend and stalker Frank (Malcolm Shields) werent all getting in the way. First time writer-director Justin Molotnikov sets himself a challenge, juggling a painfully intimate pitch-black character study with a gloomy, claustrophobic genre thriller. It doesnt all work  the digital photography is bland and the more melodramatic aspects of the plot are unwieldy. But Crying with Laughter is an impressive low-budget debut. It builds on McColes seedy central performance to create a believable and sympathetic portrait of a bitter, beaten man finding his way back to the world.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Youd never guess, until perhaps the final, magnificent trial scene, that Powell and Pressburgers post-war film grew out of the Ministry of Informations desire for a film celebrating British-American relations. RAF pilot Peter Carter (David Niven, below) falls in love with Boston-born radio operator June (Kim Carter) at an unfortunate moment: just as hes plunging to the ground in a burning plane. Its after he hits the ground that the conceit kicks in: colour disappears and were in a black-and-white heaven, where clerks are waiting for Peter  only he got lost in typically English fog and has met up with June and fallen in love. What to do? Especially when a village doctor is prepared to fight Peters case at the highest levels of justice. When the camera pulls back from the celestial court towards the end to reveal an audience of thousands  most of them combatants  Powell and Pressburger apply the weight of six years of war to this loopy love story.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The story was already old-fashioned in 1948: budding prima ballerina Victoria (Moira Shearer) finds herself torn between the divergent demands of art and heart, as represented by two equally headstrong men  tortured control freak and impresario Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) and lovelorn composer Julian (Marius Goring). When they put aside their differences and collaborate, they produce work of awe-inspiring beauty, but ultimately the simmering tension between them leads to tragedy.<br /></p><p>The realisation that were in the presence of genius comes just a few minutes into The Red Shoes, as a gaggle of eager balletomanes take their places for the inaugural performance of Lermontovs latest masterpiece. They settle into their seats, the roar around them fades, a cheery onscreen ticker reads 45 minutes later, and Michael Powell moves us forward in time without even breaking the shot.These quietly radical directorial flourishes can be found throughout the film and Powells entire canon  but what sets this greatest of all British filmmakers apart from the competition is his refusal to thrust his genius in the audiences face, subsuming his natural showmans flair to the demands of story and character. <br />Until the time comes to cut loose, at which point Powell unleashes the most eyepopping visual extravaganza imaginable. Blending impressionist art and expressionist film, blurring the barriers between theatre and cinema, body and camera, reality and dream, drawing equally on the avant-garde and the classical, the centrepiece ballet is a sequence of sheer, reckless transcendence. Its here that The Red Shoes becomes more than the sum of its hoary old parts, taking flight as the crowning glory of our national cinema.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Let nobody claim that Jim Jarmusch isnt a grand master of the ironic Zen shaggy-dog caper, in that every one of his eccentric films features bewildered men (rarely women) ambling down the road less travelled to locations of unclear significance. With The Limits of Control, his ode to John Boormans stark 1967 revenge thriller Point Blank, he has delivered a work of dazzling formal discipline that riffs on the simple notion of repetition and variation. <br />The films succession of cryptic encounters  involving Isaach de Bankol as a steely, Melvillian lone gunman on a mission in Spain  feel more like painstakingly sculpted stanzas of a poem than they do twists in some contrived yarn. Certainly, some will find Jarmuschs convention-bending games a little testing, but in craftily withholding so much information about where were headed (or, indeed, where weve come from), he forces us to work harder to find meaning in the films ambiguities. Why does De Bankol keep visiting that gallery? Why does he always order two single espressos? What do the absurd outpourings of the supporting players  a white-haired Tilda Swinton musing on films and dreams, a scraggy John Hurt discussing the derivation of the term bohemian, etc  actually mean? <br />Jarmusch takes great pleasure in daring us to suppress our expectations of where pulp genre films are supposed to take us and the emotional cues theyre supposed to house. Being black, celibate and monosyllabic, De Bankols criminal operative inverts all the usual trappings of the traditional screen gangster, and once you apply that rule to everything within the films exotic, strangely logical world (beautifully photographed by Chris Doyle), then its point will become clear.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This ghostly, semi-improvised guided tour through the shell-damaged streets of Beirut and the countryside of southern Lebanon soon after the bombings of summer 2006 offers a candid prcis on the human cost of war. It also weighs up the relative merits of documentary and fiction filmmaking within such a sensitive context. <br />Playing herself, Catherine Deneuve is the guest of honour at a gala dinner in Beirut, but first she asks if she can be driven around the area to witness the devastation firsthand. She strikes up a fond rapport with French-speaking Lebanese actor Rabih Mrou who is her chauffeur as they travel through the rubble. <br />Husband-and-wife team Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige capture their meandering conversations but also ensure the wider tragedy is present, whether in glassy shots of the sprawling wreckage or as reflections in the car windows. They never take full dramatic advantage of the situation (as Philippe Aractingi did in 2007 with Under the Bombs), and theres no denying that this is a single-note film, but its a note of considerable emotional clout.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Click here to read our interview with the director of 'Mid-August Lunch'</p><p>Its no secret that many Italian men stay at home with mamma until they get married, or at least until mamma finally kicks them out into the big, bad world. But this low-key Italian charmer, which is more of a touching, humorous short story than a fully fleshed novel, takes that idea to extreme lengths. Writer-director Gianni Di Gregorio (one of the writers on last years Gomorrah, but dont expect any guns here) plays Gianni, a placid Roman in his fifties who lives with his elderly mum Valeria (Valeria De Franciscis), a refined 80 year old who always looks like shes dressed for dinner at the Ritz back in 1963.<br /><br />This loving pair live in a comfortable city-centre apartment, surrounded by good furniture and knickknacks accumulated over many years, but we know they have little cash as the manager of their building comes knocking, wondering when theyre going to pay their service charges. In place of a cheque, Gianni agrees to look after the managers mother for the weekend. However, when the mother, Grazia, turns up, she has another relative, Maria, in tow. Within hours, Gianni has also agreed to take care of Marina, his doctors mother, which means hell be spending the mid-August holiday (ferragosto) in the company of four women with a combined age of around 350.<br /><br />Its a bit of a stretch to call this a comedy, even though it puts a warm grin on your face from beginning to end. The real beauty of the film lies in how Di Gregorio quietly realises the relationships between Gianni and the four women. These ladies might need a bit of looking after, but they still like to talk about boys, eat good food and even, in one case, wander off in the middle of the night for a furtive drink.<br /><br />Underlying this amiable, thoughtful film is an assumption that age should bring with it respect  and however exasperated he gets, Gianni abides by this code completely. Oddly, the film reminded me a little of Curb Your Enthusiasm, partly because Gianni, with his silly domestic horse-trading, comes across as a much kinder incarnation of Larry David and partly because it shares a freewheeling concern for the absurdity of the everyday, such as when Gianni has to buy food from a local fisherman to feed his unexpected guests. But this is very much a real and warm enterprise, not least because Di Gregorio extracts such lovely performances from his elderly cast. A treat.</p><p>Click here to read our interview with the director of 'Mid-August Lunch' <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Click here to read an interview with Cruz<br />Theres often something charmingly eccentric about the English titles of Pedro Almodvars films, as if Spains greatest living director spent just a few minutes pondering their translation with the aid of an online Spanish-English dictionary. Live Flesh? What exactly is that? Bad Education? The Spanish means Bad Manners or Ill Bred. And now Broken Embraces. Im not sure what they are either, although having seen Almodvars seventeenth film twice, whats clear is that the name reflects the feeling of watching it: it pulls you in and repels you, pulls you in and repels you. After over two hours of flirtation and rejection (this is Almodvars longest film), it finally resolves itself into a beautiful love letter to cinema and its glorious potential, but not without exploring the darker side of the medium and how a film can so easily slip through its makers fingers.<br /><br />While some of Almodvars films are out-and-out heartbreakers  perfect storms of melodrama, storytelling and extreme living  this is a more cerebral, self-reflective and noir-ish affair. Its part of his brilliance to tell wild stories without you even batting an eyelid. But here you cant help notice the films complexity, not least because this tragic romantic thriller is mostly about films and filmmaking: Almodvar is intent on piling image upon image so that there are several films within a film, including an amusing pastiche of the directors own Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, here renamed Girls and Suitcases.<br />We start in the present: Harry Caine (Llus Homar) is a blind scriptwriter who doesnt let his disability disarm him: we encounter him having fun on his sofa with a woman who helped him to cross the road. But his past rears its head when a young man comes knocking and we flash back to 1992 to meet Lena (Penlope Cruz), a young secretary driven to desperate measures to help her ill father. Two years later, Lena is living with her violent, older millionaire boss Ernesto Martel (Jos Luis Gmez) and starring in a film funded by Martel and directed by Caine  not yet blind and using his real name, Mateo Blanco.<br />To explain more is unnecessary, but Almodvar explores themes of spying and control, each of which he reflects through cinema itself: Martel follows his wife via snatched video recordings; Blanco fights for the ownership of his work as much as he struggles to keep a grip on his life; and Lena seeks personal and professional escape through acting.<br />Cruz is as enchanting as ever and channels images of actresses from Monroe to Audrey Hepburn through her various masks of hair, clothes and make-up. The photography may be more restrained in colour than anything Almodvar has produced but this suits the films stately, reflective air. Be warned though: you have to be prepared to think more than you feel, and to think more about cinema even than life itself. But what brilliant thoughts<br />Click here to read an interview with Cruz<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[JM Coetzees 1999 examination of post-apartheid South Africa may have scooped up the Booker but its hardly an obvious candidate for a film. David Lurie (John Malkovich), a disenchanted Cape Town professor, has an affair with a mixed-race student that borders on rape; rumbled, he refuses to apologise  or at least to profess regret. He leaves for his daughters remote farm, where hes gradually brought to realise that racial integration is a bad joke and that both colours, like the dogs David helps put down, are caged, mistreated or killed at random, without reference to their actions. Its an enormously complicated story with great potential for reductive schmaltz, but this is avoided thanks to Anna Maria Monticellis sharp, sensitive screenplay and superb performances from Jessica Haines and, particularly, Malkovich as Lurie, a self-described beast as isolated and conflicted as the country he inhabits.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Click here for an in-depth look at 'District 9'</p><p>Science-fiction and politics used to be inextricably intertwined, with sci-fi shedding light on contemporary issues through the construction of fantastic, allegorical worlds. Blame George Lucas, blame the studio money men, but sci-fi has become a largely escapist genre: dime store romance for white males. Not that theres anything wrong with escapism, as Neill Blomkamp demonstrates in the latter half of his debut feature, District 9. But he sets up his political agenda first, and the result pays dividends both as ideology and entertainment. <br />The place is present-day Johannesburg, a recognisably gritty, crime-filled metropolis on the brink of permanent collapse. But in Blomkamps South Africa theres a new underclass: a race of immigrant aliens known as prawns, survivors of a dying planet searching for a new home. Our guide into this world is Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a self-satisfied middle manager for shady global corporation MNU, whose task is to contain the prawns within their hastily constructed inner city slum, District 9.<br />It would have been easy for Blomkamp to play the film as a straight Apartheid metaphor, a blunt but rather outdated critique of inequality. But District 9 has a more pressing and timely agenda: its about the legacy of that hateful regime, how its insidious influence has produced a country where the previously disenfranchised black citizenry are beginning to turn on an even more  deprived social group: immigrants. And so the film becomes a portrait of cyclical segregation, with the prawns as a catch-all metaphor for displaced asylum seekers worldwide. <br />But District 9 is no dry socio-political treatise. The opening scenes use newsflashes, ad breaks and to-camera interviews to set up the complex backstory, but these distancing techniques fall away as our focus narrows on Wikus, who is beginning to experience grotesque bodily transformations after accidentally ingesting a mysterious alien fluid. The climactic sequences  as MNUs hunt for the renegade Wikus causes widespread and violent disruption  eschew subtext entirely in favour of nailbiting, brain-splattering action, but its unlikely many viewers will begrudge Blomkamps decision to cut loose. <br />With the films finale  and Stateside success  leaving the stage set for a potential District 10,  perhaps were witnessing a new dawn for politically engaged sci-fi and horror, with Blomkamp as a latter-day George Romero. Either way, this is a stunningly impressive debut.<br />Click here for an in-depth look at 'District 9' <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its a frustrating case of individual triumph cancelling out collective cohesion in this sporadically enjoyable, if tonally mismatched, anthology of five short films, each intent on skewering the political corruption that set in during the final 15 years of the Ceaucescu regime in Romania (touted as The Golden Age). The film feeds its tall tales (or legends) through an absurdist comic mangle in order to explore the cruel ironies bubbling beneath the surface of party policy. While the hits far outweigh the misses, its still something of a struggle to ingest a would you believe it? funny such as The Legend of the Party Photographer (which hilariously riffs on the draconian censorship of state newspaper Scinteia) when followed by the more melancholy likes of The Legend of the Chicken Driver (about a bashful trucker who instigates a poultry scam to impress a woman). Impressive, then, but really uneven.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hands up who ever thought theyd see the director of Four Weddings and a Funeral making a Jerry Bruckheimer movie  and a video game adaptation to boot? As with his instalment in the Harry Potter saga, Mike Newell was clearly brought in to add a touch of dramatic gravitas to this flimsiest of summer blockbusters. Its a strategy which pays off  but only just.<br />The plot feels cobbled together from myriad sources: a pinch of The Thief of Baghdad, a smattering of The Mummy and a hefty dollop of The Thousand and One Nights. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Dastan, a one-time street urchin (natch) elevated to Persian Princeling by the generosity of good King Sharaman. But when Dastan goes against his two brothers and their scheming uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley, whose moustache is just too short to twirl malevolently), hes framed for the kings murder and flees into the desert with only his camel and a bad-tempered princess (Gemma Arterton) for company. <br />As this synopsis suggests, Newell and his screenwriters leave no historical fantasy clich unmolested, and thats before we get to the mystical dagger, the supernatural assassins and Alfred Molina as a jolly, morally dubious gambler. The story does feel overfamiliar and suffers from a lack of dramatic tension as a consequence. Matters arent helped by shoddy CGI and some seriously silly last-act developments.<br />But Newell keeps things moving at a lick, barely allowing his actors a pause for breath between bouts of knockabout banter before chucking them into another athletic action scene. And Gyllenhaal is good value, his natural vulnerability working to offset some slightly alarming action-hero abs. Prince of Persia wont linger long in the memory  but then it probably wasnt meant to.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[With this laughably overdramatic documentary, filmmaker David Bond sets out to discover the truth behind the surveillance culture which supposedly tracks our every move. But instead he unwittingly reveals the existence of an even more powerful force at work in our society: rampant, unsubstantiated middle-class paranoia. By taking himself off the grid for 30 days and hiring a team of private investigators to track him through his online presence and government records, Bond was hoping to prove how much the state knows about us. But while he shivers in contrived terror in a Welsh potting shed, the investigators are miles away, content to sift through his rubbish and Facebook pictures. The most bizarre thing is that Bond and his cohorts believe it proves their point. In fact, it proves the opposite: while online searches and web-tracking devices get the investigators nowhere, all it takes is an old-fashioned phone call to wrap the whole mess up.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When Kate (Demi Moore) and Steve (David Duchovny) arrive in suburbia complete with wide smiles, attractive kids and the latest designer gear, theyre an instant hit. Soon, everyone wants what shes wearing and what hes driving. This is no accident: employed by a marketing firm, the Joneses are as manufactured as the products they promote. Researching the local demographic, they compete to influence brand spending patterns amid colleagues, classmates, even lovers. Its a fascinating idea, and the logistics of their skilled subterfuge keep the story chugging along for some time. Moore is well cast as the mother/boss, while Duchovny adds heart as the newbie troubled by his conscience. But this fails to get under the skin of its characters, flitting between dark comedy, melodrama and so-so satire without ever finding a tangible sense of direction. Youll enjoy meeting the Joneses, but whether youll want to keep up with them is another story.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of Dear John comes another Nicholas Sparks weepie. You know the drill: boy meets girl, while we wonder whos going to die. But while Dear John had capable, charismatic leads, The Last Song stars a guy from Neighbours (Liam Hemsworth) and Hannah Montana (aka Miley Cyrus). Hemsworth is not so bad, but Cyrus doesnt convince, believing a toothy pout is a catch-all for any emotion but happiness. And her character pouts a lot: teenage Ronnie is sulking with her father (Greg Kinnear) while spending a summer at his beachhouse. Her parents have split, so shes wearing a lot of black, but she starts brushing her hair when local hunk Will (Hemsworth) comes on the scene. As a chaste romance ensues, things are enlivened by 13-year-old Bobby Coleman as Ronnies brother: a cute, characterful kid, hes the one wholl get you laughing and blubbing. Anyone but Cyrus fans will find this one of the more inferior Sparks adaptations  and yes, that includes Nights in Rodanthe.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The X-Men, Spider-Man and Batman movies have proven that the second instalment is where a comic-book blockbuster series finds its feet: with all those pesky origin details out of the way, the filmmakers can focus on raising the stakes, deepening the characters and ramping up the action. <br />And for the first 45 minutes or so, this is where Iron Man 2 looks to be heading. Director Jon Favreau sets the stage for a titanic three-way conflagration as Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is under investigation by the US government following the public revelation of his superhero persona, while his arch rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) is scrambling after his technology and mysterious, musclebound Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) is up to unspecified no-good.<br />The dialogue crackles, the special effects pop and the onscreen action never flags, climaxing with an astonishing multi-car pileup at the Monaco Grand Prix, where Iron Man meets his nemesis Vanko, aka Whiplash, for the first time. So far, so excellent: Favreau builds on the solid foundations of the first movie, and success looks guaranteed. But slowly, imperceptibly, it all starts to fall apart during the remaining hour or so.<br />A major problem is the number of characters: Downey, Rockwell and Rourke are obviously all enjoying themselves enormously, but the same cant be said for Don Cheadle as Starks redundant buddy-cum-sidekick Rhodes. Nor do the others seem to be having much fun: Gwyneth Paltrow is underused as Stark's assistant-cum-love interest Pepper Potts, while Scarlett Johanssens Natalie is slinky but pointless. The less said about a perfunctory appearance from Samuel L Jackson as some sort of shady inter-agency bigwig the better.<br />As the film plays out, it starts to look likely that all the rumours of reshoots and recuts werent just online rabble-rousing. Characters appear and vanish. Seemingly important plot details surface and are swept away. And this feels increasingly like a film which got lost in the edit. Whereas in the first act we jetted from Siberia to Washington to Monaco, the second half is mostly confined to a series of boardrooms, army bases and laboratories. A flat, studio-bound final showdown takes an age to arrive and is over in minutes.<br />Iron Man 2 is a lot of fun: its shiny, likeable and never boring. But its also wildly uneven and unnecessarily convoluted, leaving the viewer unsatisfied and hungry for something more substantial. Lets hope a promised third instalment can fulfil the series undeniable potential.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A clever satire on Londons art scene? What a treat. But no  what we get with this slick, shallow and flesh-adoring adaptation of Danny Moynihans NYC-set novel, transposed to London, is a limp series of caricatures, hysterical scenes and an overloaded plot that suggest its makers cared more about packing the frame with names than getting the characters and comedy just right. And what names: Danny Huston, Gillian Anderson, Heather Graham, Alan Cumming, Christopher Lee, Amanda Seyfried, Stellan Skarsgrd, Jaime Winstone and Simon McBurney all appear. Its a giggle at times. Huston is louche as a Jay Jopling-like art dealer trying to get his hands on a Mondrian; Anderson amuses as a scene-obsessed collector; and Cumming is shrill as a wannabe curator-manager rejected by a self-obsessed video artist (Winstone) once she finds success. But well-connected, first-time feature director Duncan Ward (his wife is a top curator) throws too much mud too fondly for any to stick. Art world aficionados will have a jolly time identifying the characters and tut-tutting. Others will just tut-tut.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Like a meat pie snatched from a stall at a non-league football game, One Night in Turin is one of those movies that fills a hole at just the right time: this documentary waxes nostalgic about Englands turbulent Italia 90 World Cup campaign, neatly slotting in to the pre-hype for the 2010 World Cup. Adapted from the bestselling book All Played Out by Pete Davies, this slick film offers some lively context to the improbable rise of Bobby Robsons loveable rogues  including weeping wunderkind, Gazza  amid a storm of street violence, media harassment and weak lager. Its a familiar tale, but only the hardest of hearts would dismiss its storytelling gusto and clever use of archive footage. Still, it is marred by a jingoistic undertow, encapsulated by Gary Oldmans orgasmic narration where every utterance of the word football or England is coupled with a teary-eyed climax.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Two years ago, a British film called Three and Out asked us to sympathise with a tube driver on the search for suicides to aid his retirement plans. With Gurinder Chadhas amateurish and awkward latest, a similar big ask applies. Set among the lower-middle-class Asian communityof Southall, it sees Shabana Azmi as the apparently benevolent Mrs Sethi, a widow desperate for her slightly tubby daughter (Goldy Notay) to tie the knot. As the knock-backs mount up so do the corpses, as Mrs Sethi tracks down and kills all those who rebuff her marriage requests, only for her victims to return as slapstick apparitions. Despite sympathetic performances from the two leads, the idea of producing a one-for-the-mums romcom dashed with brutal slayings and trashy gore is baffling. Sally Hawkins provides light relief as The Dippy Best Friend whose story culminates in a spurious Carrie reference, but otherwise, pickings are slim.]]></review>

In a fine and well-illustrated course through the unassuming meastros life and work, director McCall calls on Martin Scorsese, Kirk Douglas and Kathleen Byron among others to comment on Cardiff's inspirational work (which included a passionate amateur painting career and a dozen films as director) and gentlemanly demeanour.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This Cronenbergian exploration of the perils of inter-species gene-splicing wrestles with some topical and disturbing ideas, but never quite pins them down. When brilliant young scientists Clive Nicoli (Adrien Brody) and Elsa Kast (Sarah Polley) secretly create Dren (Delphine Chaneac)  a wide-eyed and strangely beautiful hybrid of animal and human DNA  they quickly realise that their scientific hubris far outstrips their parenting skills. Due to her accelerated development, Dren soon develops from an innocent, dependent infant into a rebellious adolescent. Influenced by her own troubled childhood, Elsa becomes a cruelly controlling mother; father figure Clive, on the other hand, is seduced by the perverse attraction that the now sexually aware Dren feels for him. Having spent more than a decade in utero, the dense script by director/co-writer Vincenzo Natali (Cube, Cypher) is, like the fussy creature design, over-elaborated. That said, it is fascinating to see the arrogant human scientists revealed as monsters, even as the monstrous Dren reveals her complex, vulnerable humanity. Sadly, the intellectual sparks that do fly burn brightly but only briefly.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA['Morris is my life I'd die for it.' Derecq Twist (Oldham) is a quiet radical of the Morris dancing world, although you wouldn't guess it from looking at this meek West Dorset tractor mechanic. Actress Akhurst directs her first feature from a script by lead actor Oldham, whose mock-doc approach to Morris is straight out of the Christopher Guest mould. It's tough to maintain the momentum of this brand of straight-faced comedy over an entire feature, but a kind-hearted approach to character and warm attitude towards its subject helps  along with the sort of daring that allows Akhurst to film Californian scenes in what looks suspiciously like Devon. Akhurst's thesp connections no doubt helped to lure names such as Jacobi, Walter and Wise to the party. Very silly, but rigorously so.]]></review>

Then the camera dives beneath the surface and were presented with a kaleidoscope of sea creatures the likes of which few of us have seen. The effect is like immersing ones head in a giant aquarium.The close-ups, too, are often breathtaking. When Jim Carreys sufficient voiceover describes the propulsion system of the bizarre leafy sea dragon, the camera closes in to reveal a row of microscopic fins seemingly invisible to the naked eye. Its that kind of detail that makes a the film such an immersive experience. An educational one, too.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its an odd response to such a mammoth movie, but Spider-Man 3 feels a bit like watching a TV season box-set  in a good way. Its partly the sheer length, partly the well-paced but notably episodic plot, but mostly because it offers the culmination of the cohesive narrative of honesty and betrayal, to oneself and ones loved ones, that has underscored the whole franchise. Its an impressive achievement, balancing petty psychological foibles against citywide peril just as the CG mise en scne roves from the molecular to the multi-storey.<br />We open with Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), and his girl Mary-Jane (Kirsten Dunst) in the pink, though this of course cant last. Their schoolfriend Harry (James Franco), embittered son of the first films Green Goblin, is nursing Hamlet-lite revenge fantasies against our hero, who must also contend with the Dracula-Frankenstein combo of Venom  a black glob of parasitic alien symbiote that brings out its hosts dark side  and Sandman, the shape-shifting result of fugitive Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) being scientifically melded with, er, sand. Needless to say, this all plays havoc with everyones private life.<br />These films greatest pleasure is their gleefully swooping exploitation of Manhattans vertiginous topography  its a good job Spidey wasnt hatched in, say, Holland  and this one doesnt disappoint. Dog-fights amid skyscrapers, in the bowels of the subway and, most effectively, in a tight alleyway all exhilarate; impressively, a bare-knuckle punch-up behind closed doors packs as much wallop. Despite such action, some fine comic relief (Bruce Campbell as a French matre d) and a few cheesy moments, the tone is ultimately more subdued than your average superhero movie. Kudos to Raimi for making it feel justified.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[From the late 80s onwards, Canadian-Armenian Atom Egoyan established a much-admired celluloid reputation with a string of intoxicatingly enigmatic dramas exploring the mythologies of his messed-up characters. While 1997s The Sweet Hereafter looked like a breakthrough, working on a broader canvas proved not to be his forte, so Adoration marks a long-awaited return to the territory identifiable as an Atom Egoyan film. Hence the presence of his muse, Arsine Khanjian, as a French teacher in a Toronto high school who has her reasons for choosing as a translation exercise a news item about an Arab terrorist who planted explosives in the airline luggage of his pregnant girlfriend. Student Devon Bostick, meanwhile, claims the would-be bomber was his own father: his classmates soon have online chat rooms buzzing, yet Bosticks investment in the story is his way of working through a very different, uniquely troubled family history.<br />So is the old Egoyan mojo still working? Its a mixed bag. The themes are fascinating and perceptive, musing on the exterior and interior influences shaping our identity, while pondering whether the restorative meanings we seek from people and places in our lives are complicated by the white noise of user-generated content and the presence of post-9/11 ideological tensions. Unfortunately the elaborately unspooled plot delivering these ideas in dramatic form is so scraggy and effortful it defeats the cast and rather compromises our involvement. Egoyan still conjures up epiphanic moments, but this is best recommended to those for whom the words Speaking Parts stir a quiver of auteurist anticipation. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Young British screenwriter J Blakeson, co-writer of The Descent: Part Two and the director of two well-regarded shorts, shoots his own script for his feature debut and comes up with an intense, surprising three-hander about a kidnapping. There are hints of Sleuth in this low-budget affair: the claustrophobic energy, the small cast, the wordplay, the single location and the power games driven by sex and sexuality. The set-up is simple: two men, one ruthless with a hair-trigger temper (Eddie Marsan), one more submissive (Martin Compston), kidnap Alice (Gemma Arterton), the daughter of a businessman, lock her in a derelict flat and threaten to kill her unless a ransom is paid. Bar an early, effective montage of the kidnappers preparations and the films bloody close, the story unfolds in Alices grotty, makeshift cell and concerns itself with the shifting relationships and loyalties of its three protagonists.<br />Some might feel were in titillating FHM territory at the sight of Bond girl Arterton tied to a bed and writhing around in her underwear, but all hints of exploitation are thankfully just that. The superior acting from Arterton, Marsan and Compston, combined with Blakesons resourceful and focused direction, force through a sometimes awkward plot and rescue the film from a middle section that looks to be heading for a brick wall. The success of the film is in the detail: we watch as hostage and kidnapper negotiate the difficulties of a captive going to the toilet and feel the tension as a bullet refuses to travel round the U-bend. Arterton gives it her all, while Marsan mines a seam of rage familiar from Happy-Go-Lucky.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This latest from writer-director Jared Hess is another unsavoury stew of kitsch juvenilia that furthers the rot that set in between his first two films, Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre. The film seems to exist solely to lampoon the modern sci-fi literature community  a very easy target. Enter Benjamin (Michael Angarano), a novice author who wants to publish a space epic, Yeast Lords  but his first draft is stolen and rehashed by Dr Ronald Chevalier (Jermain Clement, pictured), a terracotta leatherwear-loving sci-fi luminary. Hess likes to throw all sorts of ironic tat on to the screen, and the cluttered production design obscures anything approaching an identifiable character. For every gag that works (like one on the names of sci-fi characters), rest assured something involving snake diarrhoea is close behind.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Give filmmaker and native son of Princes Bay James DeMonaco some credit; he puts all his heart into this absurd rob-the-mob yarn. Vincent DOnofrio chews all available scenery as a mama-loving small-time crime boss (and amateur tree-sitter), Ethan Hawke needs cash for a brain-boosting fertility procedure on his wife, and Seymour Cassel is his friend, the kindly deaf-mute salumeria butcher. That the plot suddenly shuffles the chronologypart of a post-Tarantino eye for flamboyant detail thats played for comedy and pathosmakes it feel like a new, worse movie starts halfway through. 'Staten Island' is not without surprisesnor is it any good.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Noel Clarkes latest, 4.3.2.1, is on the face of it completely different to his Kidulthood mini-franchise. Following four west London sixth-form girls who get mixed up with stolen diamonds, its a brash and ambitious play for the mainstream: girl power rebooted for anyone too young to remember Riot Grrrl or even the Spice Girls. Still, jammed as it is with teen sex and misbehaving, and with a plotline that hinges on a packet of Pringles, if youre over 21 youre probably too old to be watching.<br />Like a pop svengali, Clarke has put together a line-up of characters to cater for all tastes. The film splits into four sections, covering the same three days from the perspective of each. Tamsin Egerton plays a pretty, posh blonde who jets off to New York to lose her virginity. Ophelia Lovibond is the arty indie screw-up. American actress Emma Roberts is all sass and smarts, while Shanika Warren-Markland, who had a tiny part in Adulthood, announces herself as a big new talent as the butt-kicking, feisty one. Clarke himself appears and there are cameos from R&amp;B singer Eve and Clerks director Kevin Smith.<br />The film doesnt go in for subtlety. Its frenetically paced, with non-stop music, and pops with teen issues: abortion, self-harm, bisexuality, suicide, stalking. Thats before you get to the diamond heist. But Clarke has got an unmistakable knack for writing teens. One of this lot is more worried that her mates arent talking to her than the fact that she has an international smuggling ring on her tail. As for girl power, the message doesnt wash. These girls are brilliantly un-victimy and always come out fighting. If only they werent incessantly paraded about in their underwear for the viewing pleasure of men. For Clarke, to disenfranchise half his audience would be a crime worse than selling out the sisters.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Alejandro Amenbar, the Spanish director of The Others and The Sea Inside, puts on his sword and sandals  and thinking cap  for this sweeping, ancient-historical drama of ideas. Current debates over religious extremism and scientific rationalism hover subtly over this fictionalisation of events surrounding the sacking of the library at Alexandria in 391 in the face of rising tension between pagans, Christians and Jews. As well as recreating the city with impressive realism and scale, Amenbar develops a compelling sense of volatility and impending violence. At the centre of it all is scientist and teacher Hypatia (a relaxed Rachel Weisz), whose musings on the place of the Earth in the universe run counter to religious dogma.<br /><br />Other characters, such as Hypatias former slave Davus (Max Minghella) and her pupil-turned-Roman prefect Orestes (Oscar Isaac) are only interesting as representatives of change  and not as romantic foils. The build-up of emnity is more absorbing than its explosion and the story wanders later on, but the films portrayal of how religious fervour can interrupt the progress of secular knowledge is acute and welcome.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Having made two likeable, issue-based films  Gypo with Paul McGann and Ruby Blue with Bob Hoskins  independent British writer-director Jan Dunn seems straitjacketed with her third. St Berthas is the eccentrically populated Benedictine priory to which pretty, blackout-prone dentistry student Joanna (Emily Beecham) feels called by God, eliciting the scorn of her pal <br />(Chloe Sirene), the anger of her mother (Amanda Donohoe) and the despair of her boyfriend (Tom Stuart). The awkward uncertainty and harshness of tone the director affords these outsiders is disappointingly reflected in the insiders. Given the afflicted back-stories of characters such as ex-alcoholic Sister Gertrude (Rita Tushingham) or ex-prostitute Sister Ambrose (Susannah Harker), you may expect a little whimsy or humour, but all are played dismayingly straight, with only Brenda Blethyns progressive Sister Ignatious allowed any air. The result is a confused portrait of an unorthodox initiation, built on such sand that its final castle of optimism and tolerance quickly crumbles.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[American exile Joseph Loseys twentieth film enjoys an extended run at BFI Southbank for the next two weeks as part of a retrospective of the directors work. The 1967 film forsakes the swinging, mini-skirted metropolis for an examination of moral lassitude and contained passions among the dreaming spires and cardigan-wearing dons of Oxford academia. Youre not past it, are you? asks a student (Michael York) of his fortysomething philosophy tutor <br />(Dirk Bogarde). Hes referring to his teachers interest in a young, passion-arousing Austrian princess (played like a tailors dummy by beauteous, brown-eyed Euro-star Jacqueline Sassard), who is the sexual catalyst of this films lazily tragic events, seen by us in flashback.<br />Once a celebrated film of the British cinema renaissance  with an impeccable pedigree in contributors Nicholas Mosley (author), Harold Pinter (screenwriter) and a director in his post-The Servant ascendancy  Accident now seems a little self-conscious in its modernist, quality art-cinema pretensions, its provocative sensuality and its class-observant exposure of hidden power games trumped by the clarity of, say, Polanskis Knife in the Water. <br />Neverthess, it contains an interesting friction in the varied stylised realism of the performances (not least that between Bogarde and Stanley Baker, as a brasher fellow don), top-notch Eastmancolor cinematography by Gerry Fisher, an intriguing use of sound (jazzman John Dankworths saxy score, disrupted by the soundtracks banal clicking clocks or offscreen passing ambulances), all darkened by the discomforting sharpness of Loseys foreigners eye.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Documentary meets conceptual art in this clinical and surprisingly droll study of the industrial processes that ensure the safe arrival of food on our tables. With no narration, interviews or music to speak of, director Nikolaus Geyrhalter lets his images do the talking, often locating a beautiful core at the centre of the most mundane of procedures. </p><p>The sight of cows, pigs, chickens and fish being slaughtered is, well, pretty revolting, but the long, unblinking shots manage to imbue the material with a hallucinatory quality as well as putting forward a deeply impartial tract on the ethics of food (a buzz topic, of course) that comes across like an arty riff on the work of Frederick Wiseman (specifically his Meat) rather than a lurid polemic like Richard Linklaters Fast Food Nation.</p><p>All slicing, grinding and chopping aside, theres something unexpectedly humourous in the detail, with many of its scenes mirroring the mordant comic-tableaux style of directors like Aki Kaurismki or Roy Andersson. One shot shows a man insouciantly sawing a cow carcass down the middle with an instrument that looks like it could have been nabbed from the set of a big-budget sci-fi movie. When he has finished, he pulls his mobile out of his overalls and starts chatting like hes at a bus stop. And, for all metal and meat fetishists out there, this is the film youve been waiting your entire (peculiar) lives for. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>It all started in a coffee shop in Binghamton, New York State in 2004. When word emerged that the swirly paintings on the walls were by Mark Olmsteads four-year-old daughter Marla, the local newspaper had its story. An exhibition in a local gallery followed, the national press started sniffing, prices for the works escalated, and soon Maria was on the top TV current affairs strand 60 Minutes. Could a smiley tot really have produced the pictures? Are they as good as Jackson Pollock or Kandinsky or AN Other modern artist? If so, what does that say about standards of judgement in the multi-million-dollar art market? By which point, documentarist Amir Bar-Lev gained the confidence of the Olmstead family, and hoped to tell the story from the inside</p><p>The result is utterly fascinating, not so much for its filmmaking polish (its pretty functional), but because the people and the material fan out so many tantalising questions. Whether Marias supposedly innate painterly gifts can actually be captured on camera becomes a hot issue for everyone, not least because it would ease suspicions her dad had a guiding hand in the canvasses. Director Bar-Lev muses on the idea that by filming someone youre changing them, imposing your narrative on their truth, a fundamental notion which so-called factual cinema too often leaves unconsidered. Arguably, his film exploits little Maria as much as everyone else who made a buck out of her. But its bigger than that: a sceptical portrait of a conflicted family riding a media whirlwind, and a quizzical recognition of the limits of certitude when it comes to the glorious squiggles of a Paul Klee. or a Marla Olmstead.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>A great deal bloodier than most musicals, Tim Burtons beautifully crafted take on Stephen Sondheims stage show still feels like a kids film that no littluns will see, such is the sweep of his story, his caricaturing, and his balletic approach to killing. </p><p>But human behaviour isnt Burtons strong point, so one doesnt expect him to gain a strong grip on the psyche of Benjamin Barker  now Mr S Todd (Johnny Depp, with a skunks streak in his locks)  the barber whos back in dank Victorian London and looking for revenge on crooked Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman, resuscitating his turn in Perfume) after enduring an unjust stint in a penal colony and losing his wife and daughter. This forlorn figure is now entering a pact with local pie-maker Mrs Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter, fresh from the Queen Vic) that sees trade blossom for both  and offers Todd a busmans outlet for his anger</p><p>Theres something of the Hulk to this Todd (a monster with a heart and a troubled past), but theres a heavy dose of Fred West, too. Depp is too young and too beautiful  but he claws back some romance for his anti-hero and proves a capable singer. Its the usual Burtonisms that impress: the sets, the costumes, a masterly embrace of the sound-stage (retaining the theatricality of Sondheims original). </p><p>Theres a gulf between the colourful leads and the bland supporting roles, and Burton struggles to avoid a flat middle section that contrasts with the atmospherics of his opening and the melodrama of his finale  but mostly this is grand-scale studio-work at its most beguiling. <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Throughout the screening of Mamma Mia! I kept clocking the security guard in the corner. What was he thinking, I wondered, as Pierce Brosnan belted out a power-ballad version of Abbas SOS? For Bond purists, it must be like seeing your dad in a dress. Equally, what might this beacon of masculinity think if he saw me smiling as this featherweight and often ridiculous musical drew to a finale thats so sunny, so saccharine, that youd be forgiven for thinking that all involved were high on happy pills? <br />Presumably the guard was there to check that none of us took any snaps of Meryl Streep. There she was cavorting across the screen in dungarees with hair like straw, skipping through olive groves and singing Dancing Queen with a Greek chorus in tow. One call to the taste police and the authorities would arrest her and withdraw all reels of this sickly sweet yet wildly  bafflingly  fun film. Once the credits  which feature the cast, dressed in pantomime 70s gear, bashing out Waterloo  had rolled, I asked the guard what he thought. Ive seen it four times, he said, with perfect timing. And you like it? Pause. It has its moments. <br />The story has all the symmetry and drive of a stage show. Twenty-year-old American Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is about to marry her fianc, Sky (Dominic Cooper), in the grounds of a dilapidated hotel on a Greek island run by her tireless boho mother, Donna (Streep). Only she doesnt know which of three of her mums former lovers is her dad. The solution? Invite them all.And so, unknown to Donna, businessman Sam (Brosnan), old hippy Bill (Stellan Skarsgrd) and City gent Harry (Colin Firth) rock up to the sunniest of Greek islands. <br />They sing, they dance, they wonder whos the father. Its Paternity: The Musical. The story is pat, some voices are ropey, but Phyllida Lloyd succeeds in bringing this musical to the screen by indulging in not a whiff of 70s nostalgia (until the credits), taking all the right things seriously  design, locations, casting, choreography  and rejecting elements that would have made it less forgivable: gloss, cynicism and irony.<br />Despite a flow of beach bods, theres no worship of superficial beauty beyond the casting of the young leads, Seyfried and Cooper (and neither is a vapid youngster of The OC sort). Lloyd plays it straight as a bat and finds a working balance between the fantasy of the musical numbers, the fairytale story and the down-to-earth presentation of the characters. The one concession she makes to Hollywood is that more of the leads are American than in the stage version  but she more than compensates by casting Julie Walters in a major role. <br />Just watch her sing and dance to Take a Chance on Me. Theres nothing slick about that. The men are a rum, awkward bunch. Skarsgrd (age 57) looks like hes having far too good a time being rubbed by young women during one number; Colin Firth doesnt push the boat out and plays a bumbling Englishman; and, however hard he tries, Brosnan doesnt remind you of Brando in Streetcar even when yelling Donna! at Streep. <br />Mamma Mia! is not a mans film. I mean this in the way that films about football hooligans who get loaded and smash the skulls of other hooligans are not womens films. But I suspect that a fair few men (and not a few women) will find that this film appeals to an urge for wholesome trash and confounds their expectations. Against the odds, Mamma Mia! is a summer movie thats as camp as Christmas and as enjoyable as a pantomime. I suspect Streep will win an Oscar nomination; at 59, and still doing the splits, shes game enough to deserve one. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Reviewed at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival</p><p>Though hes been making films for nearly three decades, its only in the last five years that the work of Hong Kongs Johnnie To has become fashionable at the major European film festivals. His latest, therefore, looks like a somewhat deliberate attempt to court the French market, given that it stars ageing pop-idol-turned-movie-star Johnny Hallyday as a man who arrives in Macao to visit his daughter (Sylvia Testud), who lost her husband and children when gangsters burst, guns blazing, into their apartment during the brief pre-credits sequence. She, having survived the carnage with appalling injuries and barely a single scene left to appear in, asks Costello (for such, a tad unsurprisingly, is his name) to wreak vengeance on the culprits, a task which he, as someone who worked (again a little unsurprisingly) as a hitman before setting himself up in the Champs-Elyses restaurant business, is unusually willing and able to take on.<br />If indeed there is anything surprising about this clich-packed genre fare, its the degree to which To and his screenwriter Wai Ka-Fai are prepared to indulge their flair for the ludicrous. As Costello employs the services of three (purportedly) likeable hitmen to help him track down and kill the men who offed his son-in-law and grandkids, the film steers consistently clear of anything remotely realistic or gritty, revelling instead in plot developments, dialogue and action sequences as flagrantly absurd as theyre stylish. Nothing whatsoever rings true: not the cheap Chilean plonk Costello (apparently a great chef and wealthy bon vivant) serves up when he hires his trio of goons, not the bizarre means (involving scouts and stick-on paper flags) by which the villainous Mr Big is entrapped, not the shoot-outs and most definitely not Hallydays face, a strangely elongated, unevenly wrinkled, tiny-eyed affair that barely resembles the appearance of your average human. To call the film cartoon-like would be to do a grave disservice to the majority of comic strips. <br />That said, its far from unenjoyable (though Im not sure this kind of fluff really warrants a place in Cannes main competition). At a fairly pacy108 minutes it doesnt outlast its welcome, especially when you can feast your eyes on such marvellously idiotic imagery as Hallyday praying (altogether incredibly given his actions throughout the movie) first on a beach and then up to his neck in water. It also looks quite good in a trite, glossy and bombastic kind of way, and there are even a number of funny moments that were actually intended as such. Or so one can only hope. <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The first Night at the Museum was a fiasco, so the thought of a sequel was pretty horrendous. But here it is, and its better than predicted, though hardly fault-free: the Toy Story-esque plot could be written on the femur of dormouse and some scenes still lean towards inanity. But, in the main, this is a funnier and more coherent slice of kids entertainment. The first instalment saw Ben Stillers museum nightwatchman grapple with an assemblage of natural history exhibits that mysteriously sprang to life. Despite his new career as a flash entrepreneur, Larry (Stiller) has never forgotten his band of eclectic pals. So when he hears that New Yorks Museum of Natural History has shipped its dated exhibits to the Smithsonian Institutes underground storage facility, he feels compelled to do something about it. <br />He sneaks his way into the Institute and enlists Amy Adamss Amelia Earhart to help him hatch a rescue plan. But he hasnt figured on Hank Azarias lisping Pharaoh Stiller is still vaguely likeable in the lead but the rest of the original cast (Robin Williams, Owen Wilson, Steve Coogan and Ricky Gervais) remain unconvincing. Thank heavens, then, for newcomers Adams, Azaria and Bill Hader. Adams nails her period part with old-fashioned gusto and Hader is uproarious as a camp General Custer. But its Azarias immature Pharaoh who remains most memorable; his pantomime scenes are reminiscent of vintage Python. Figure in some quality production values, and you have a follow-up in far finer fettle.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Marriage? Its all right for some Thats Yasujiro Ozus measured assessment in this bittersweet late masterpiece. Realising their late pals widow (Setsuko Hara, the daughter-in-law from Tokyo Story) has been alone too long, three middle-aged male friends initiate a bumbling plan to find her a husband. Meanwhile, Hara herself hopes to marry off her twentysomething daughter (Yoko Tsukasa), while the latter, living at home, is worried about leaving her mum on her own. Given that none of the parties is swift to share their thoughts with anyone else, its a recipe for hurt and misunderstanding, played out as a wistful comedy of human errors.<br />If youve yet to sample Ozus special alchemy in the BFI retrospective, two hours of gently paced dialogue scenes in a succession of interiors hardly sounds enticing. However, given his Chekhovian understanding of what makes people tick, Ozu is able to depict characters who rarely seem like cogs in a plot, rather (cultural differences notwithstanding) recognisable individuals trying to make the best of things, embodied by a splendid cast who turn acting into being. Thanks to the richly saturated Agfacolor and Ozus genius for expressive colour co-ordination, the film offers as much pure aesthetic pleasure as, say, Wong Kar-Wai, but its ultimately on a human level that its most affecting. Marriage might take the edge off the loneliness of growing old, but it separates parents from children and unwittingly loosens friendships. Haras undemonstrative yet knowing half-smile in the final scene registers the inevitable paradox of loving and losing. Cinema that speaks to the soul. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Frank Goode (Robert de Niro, pictured) is as happy as recent widowers get: his four kids are coming to stay. Clocking De Niros genial crows feet fringing bewildered eyes, we arent surprised when they all cancel: one, David, doesnt even bother to do that. So Frank decides to spring visits on each of them, which is the family-drama equivalent of picking up a hitchhiker in a horror flick. If Amy (Kate Beckinsale), Rosie (Drew Barrymore) and Robert (Sam Rockwell) are such great kids, why are they neglecting their lonely dad? And wheres David? As Frank, a former telephone-cable installer, traverses the country, it becomes clear that the Goode communication lines are down. Where did he go wrong?<br />Forget Hollywood remakes; this is one film Id like to see reworked by an arthouse director and a pack of actors with smaller names and bigger reserves of subtlety (Rockwell can keep his role, though). The literalist approach of British director Kirk Jones (Nanny McPhee) sucks all <br />interest from Franks travels, and rarely has a neat ending seemed less appropriate. Phone cables are being superseded, but our connections with loved ones fray and corrode forever. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Set in what is now Scotland in AD 117, The Descent director Neil Marshalls relentless, predictable chase movie draws upon the myth of the mysterious lost Ninth Legion of the Roman army. Stranded behind enemy lines following an ambush by Pictish warriors armed with giant fireballs, a ragtag, multi-ethnic band of Roman soldiers  reluctant leader Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender), stalwart Bothos (David Morrissey), joker Thax (JJ Feild), old-timer Brick (Liam Cunningham), agile African Macros (Noel Clarke) and cowardly cook Tarak (Riz Ahmed)  attempt to weave their way across country back to the last Roman fort. Lead by the fearsome Gorlacan (Ulrich Thomsen), and guided by skilled tracker Etain (Olga Kurylenko), the hostile locals remorselessly track their prey.<br /><br />Centurion is essentially one long, breathless pursuit sequence, punctuated by violent fight scenes and redundant quieter ones: for example, Quintuss drippy romance with ostracised Pictish witch Arianne (Imogen Poots) adds nothing but some lingering shots of Pootss ethereally beautiful face. And no amount of relentless forward momentum, head-smacking violence or CGI-enhanced blood-letting can disguise the anaemic characterisation and obvious contrivances. Stick-thin Bond girl Kurylenkos role as the mute, vengeful warrior Etain is no more believable or convincing than that of Keira Knightley in King Arthur. Both look as if a faint breeze would blow them over. The fearless, credible Fassbinder deserves better than this, as does The Wire alumnus Dominic West, cruelly wasted in an abbreviated cameo as the aptly named commanding officer General Titus Virilus. Finally, the abrupt, unsatisfying ending suggests a crisis of confidence in the cutting room.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Harry Potter stalwart Rupert Grint confirms he has the acting chops for the long haul in this otherwise mediocre Belfast-shot youth flick. Its familiar stuff: two guys, one girl, guess the rest. As the reserved ginger one, Rupe is hardly odds-on favourite to win the heart of minxy Kimberley Nixon, especially when the competition is rakish, tousle-haired dude Robert Sheehan  his nominal best pal. The ensuing emotional rough-and-tumble proves less arresting than it might have been, however, since the framing device drops too heavy a hint about a fairly obvious outcome, and the inequalities in the performers skill levels do tell. Right down to the impeccable Ulster accent, Grint is note perfect, but his playmates struggle to convince, while the directors seem to flap when faced with anything more expansive than angsty interiors. Its cheering to see a Northern Irish story moving beyond the Troubles, but the merely adequate theatrics on display arent noteworthy in themselves. Grint looks set for better things.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Were doing time, quality time! remonstrates Alice (Johanne Murdock), the frustrated wife of preoccupied, over-analytical commercial lawyer Neil (Adam Napier) as the two fight their way through a holiday in an idyllic Fenland villa in writer-director-cinematographer Sasha C Damjanovskis competently acted but bemusing and frustrating micro-budget debut. At first, Neil seems nearer the verge of a nervous breakdown, but as the dancing couple swaying to MOR Latin beats are revealed as mere figments of Alices escapist imagination, it becomes clear that it takes two to tango in this dysfunctional relationship. With its still, crystalline landscape photography and sub-Pinteresque speech rhythms, Dance with Me has the look and feel of a Latin-American art movie (albeit, a poor one) and the threatening aura of a piece of experimental Theatre of Cruelty (a pretentious one), while grand metaphor hangs over it like a cloud of unknowing. Its possible the director is attempting a crude equation between dance and sex, but the reason why is anybodys guess.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Thanks to the likes of Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry, time-hopping, genre-bending fractured narratives are ten-a-penny nowadays. So its refreshing to see a film which genuinely tries to explore the form. Set in five different time periods and incorporating subjects as disparate as punk, plagiarism, rape, romance, religion and impending armageddon, Fish Story is as much a jigsaw puzzle as a movie, a challenge set by a first-time writer-director determined to go somewhere completely new.<br />In post-war Japan, a book is published entitled Fish Story, but thanks to a botched translation, every copy but one is pulped. In 1975, a revolutionary punk band are inspired to write a song of the same name. In 1982, three adolescents listen to the song on their way to meet girls. In 2009, a schoolgirl has an action-packed encounter with a would-be superhero who happens to have a family connection to one of the above trio. And in 2012, as a comet streaks for Earth, a pair of record store nerds play Fish Story one last time as they wait for the end.<br />The fact that it doesnt quite hang together is part of the undoubted charm of Fish Story: as the title suggests, the joy is as much in the telling as in any vague conclusions the movie may present. The result is a wonderfully entertaining and affecting patchwork of ideas, incidents, contrivance and coincidence.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The recent Karate Kid remake signalled Jackie Chans increasing willingness to inject a little more emotional weight into his popcorn roles, and its a trend he develops in Little Big Soldier, an unpredictable and highly entertaining Eastern western. Chan plays an unnamed farmer conscripted by the Liang army in their war against the Wei dynasty. When the two armies essentially wipe each other out, Chan kidnaps the Wei general and heads for home, hoping to claim a reward. At first, Little Big Soldier is structured like a comic road movie, as the two leads bicker and battle across rural China, facing bears, bandits and bad guys along the way. But as the stakes rise and the violence intensifies the movie becomes richer, sadder and more engrossing: a mournful treatise on exploitation and the true cost of war, albeit interspersed with a fistful of superbly directed, high-octane fight scenes. Genre-benders who like their Leone-esque historical slapstick buddy-action epics with a side order of political tragedy will find much to enjoy here.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[With its scruffy, laconic anti-hero, savage sense of humour and bleak air of working-class desperation, Triomf initially feels like a South African take on TVs Shameless. But this tale of a white trash Johannesburg family on the eve of black liberation soon reveals itself as a far more sadistic proposition. The episodic plot spirals inexorably towards disaster as misanthropic fridge repairman Treppie decides to hire a whore for his violent, incestuous, epileptic nephew Lambert on his twenty-first birthday. The script scores a few sly political points and there are isolated moments of dark wit and raw, ugly emotional power. But mostly this is a sour, slipshod affair which laughs at, rather than engages with, its cast of ignorant hillbilly freaks and revels voyeuristically in the grotesque details of its sleazy suburban setting. The end result is a film lacking in sympathy, which offers up a smart, scabrous portrait of four repellent individuals but never gives us a reason to care what happens to them.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>All but remaking the 1953 art-house classic <i>Tokyo Story</i> in its first third, <i>Cherry Blossoms</i> fortunately sidesteps rank mimicry in favor of wry homage and something more. Director-screenwriter Doris Drrie, of 2007s foodie doc <i>How to Cook Your Life, </i>applies Ozus pet themes (encroaching mortality) and symbols (trains abound) to her own concerns, notably a rumination on the confounding estrangement from self and spouse that can occur in even the longest-lived and most agreeable of marriages.</p><p>The film sends middle-aged, unspectacular Bavarian couple Rudi (Wepper) and Trudi (Elsner) on the road after she learns of his terminal illness (regimented, change-resistant Rudi is kept in the dark). Their destination is Japan, which intrigues Trudi, but they stop off in Berlin to visit their grown children and then move on to the Baltic for a seaside idyll. The story takes a sad and unexpected turn there, after which Rudi completes the couples trip alone. An indigent Butoh dancer (Irizuki) in Tokyo helps him channel something of his wifesand his owncoupledom-sequestered identity.Its not as pat as it sounds. In the vein of Ozu, Drrie finds grace and bittersweet humor in the muted pain and moot dignity of modern life, but the similarities end there: To my knowledge, the Japanese masters leading men never donned their leading ladies clothes, nor would doing so have seemed as absurdly, movingly spot-on.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[If you thought Mussolinis record as a statesman was patchy, wait until you see how he treated his lovers. Italian veteran Marco Bellocchio delivers an operatic slice of historical muckraking which exhumes the tale of Ida Dalser (Giovanna Mezzogiorno), spurned wife of the lantern-jawed lothario who would become Il Duce (Filippo Timi). Smitten by the rhetoric of the young socialist firebrand, Idas courtship with Benito takes place in the shadows until he is drawn into national politics and she is left destitute but certain she can win him back. Much like Paolo Sorrentinos Il Divo, the dizzying technical flair employed to tell Dalsers story (back projection, animated intertitles, a bombastic score) is as much a clue to whats going on with these characters as the fragmentary details of the story. Timi channels Klaus Kinski in his virtuoso reading of Mussolini, projecting with the full force of his muscular frame. In contrast, Mezzogiorno superbly expresses Dalsers decline from sultry assurance to anguished obsession.<br /><br />Its a film rife with ambiguities and ellipses that will intrigue or infuriate depending on taste. The motivation behind Mussolinis rejection of his wife is vague, while Dalsers commitment to winning recognition from her husband confirms rather than refutes her insanity, making it tough to sympathise with her. Yet, its clear that Bellocchio wants Dalsers martyrdom to be read as a wider statement on the fate of Italy under Fascism, making the film an astute study of amour fou and a cautionary tale about how the worship of false idols can lead to personal and national collapse.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Playboy weapons magnate Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is a greased amalgam of Howard Hughes, Hugh Hefner and C-3PO, complete with an enviable battery of glib banter and a goatee you could set your watch by. On a routine sales trip to the Middle East, his Humvee is ambushed by a terrorist cell and he is dragged away to a cave, where he is forced to reproduce one of his high-powered missiles with some scrap metal and a soldering iron.<br /><br />Instead, Stark uses those materials to construct a suit of robotic body armour and flee from the extremists clutches. This channels his epiphany  perhaps long overdue  that profiteering from weapons is far from the Promethean zenith of overarching compassion he once thought it was. He returns a changed man and, with the help of his svelte assistant Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) and best mate Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), builds a shiny suit of armour with which he plans to put an end to warfare for good.<br /><br />All this liberal hand-wringing comes much to the chagrin of the sinisterly named Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), Starks devious benefactor, who doesnt shine to his peacenik jabbering one bit. Stane sports both a bald pate and a beard, a red flag combination in comic-book land if ever there was one.<br />Actor-turned-director Jon Favreau has proved with his past directorial efforts, including buddy comedy Made, Christmas film Elf and kids fantasy Zathura, that he has a keen eye for character and can spin a decent yarn. Sadly, these two qualities are rarely apparent here, replaced instead by quick-fix one-liners and predictable set-piece gags. Like Iron Mans suit, Favreaus film feels like it has been meticulously assembled rather than lovingly formed. Its little more than an elongated, episodic and sporadically charming introduction to the life of this mechanised millionaire superhero, light on both CGI and moral quandaries, and possessing neither the zip and sparkle of a Spider-Man nor the brooding existential subtexts of Batman Begins.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Robin Hardys bizarre 1973 cult classic is the oddest of the Summer of British Film weekly reissues. Set on the Western Isles of Scotland, it poses a burning question for investigating mainland Sergeant Edward Woodward: could a missing 12-year-old girl have been sacrificed in some creepy, ancient fertility rite by the libidinous, pre-feudal inhabitants? Anthony Shaffers script  written at the end of an annus mirabilis in which he also wrote Sleuth and Frenzy  brews together a heady concoction of police procedural and post-Hammer horror with a pagan pastiche of counter-cultural faddishness, with scenes of dancing naked pregnant women in stone circles or a ranting, windswept Christopher Lee in drag beautifully filmed by Harry Waxman and accompanied by Paul Giovannis risible 60s-style folk revival soundtrack. Essentially, its an insane guilty pleasure, still enjoyable for its delightfully eccentric casting  Britt Eklands fine Scottish accent and Hammer star Ingrid Pitts dour librarian  and for the funniest, creepiest pub scene in British movies outside of next weeks reissue, Withnail &amp; I.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[If biopics Amadeus and Man on the Moon offered askew looks at their subjects, Milos Formans latest strains the neck further. The great Francisco Goya (Stellan Skarsgrd) is little more than observer here, making way for an imagining of the afflicted souls who inspired and haunted his twisted artworks. Thus, enter Goyas muse Ins (Natalie Portman), imprisoned and tortured by the Inquisition for Judaising, and soft-voiced Inquisition supremo, Brother Lorenzo (Javier Bardem), himself (in a wonderfully mad scene) tortured by Ins merchant  father until he confesses hes the bastard son of a chimpanzee and agrees to help her. Co-scripted by Buuels screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrire, its watchable, if faintly ridiculous, giving off a distinct  mini-series whiff as 15 years later Lorenzo returns as a  Bonapartist and Ins, with the now-deaf Goyas help, searches for her missing daughter (Portman again). With its riffs on art, its split-in-half story and Goya-esque production design, you can see it reaching for grand ideas about actions and their reverberations, but it merely rumbles on, illuminating neither the artist nor his tumultuous times.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>It doesnt say a whole lot that this dramaabout a quartet of nave young singles in Tel Avivwon the Audience Award at the Toronto Inside and Out Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival earlier this year. Since queer films of late tend to take the path of least resistance (hot guys + lame plot = DVD success), any film that can arouse an audience beyond an erection tends to receive a standing O (no pun intended). In fact, this entry from Eytan Fox (<i>Yossi &amp; Jagger</i>) fully merits the award. </p><p>When Noam (Knoller), an Israeli reserve officer, loses his I.D. at a military checkpoint, Ashraf (Sweld), a visiting Palestinian, delivers it to his home. A romance ensues to the delight and occasional dismay of Noams hipster roommates, Lulu (Wircer) and Yali (Freidmann), whose answer to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is to stage an all-night Rave Against the Occupation. Ashraf lives with the trio in constant fear that his Arab identity will be discovered and hell have to return home to the West Bank, where being gay is forbidden.</p><p>The bubble could easily serve as a metaphor for the gossamer shell built around Boystown, blue states, etc. More important, of course, is what happens when the bubble pops, and thats where the film finds its true heart.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Austrian director Gtz Spielmanns impressively mounted, quietly moody film is as much an attempt at social and ethical enquiry as it is a revenge crime thriller. Alex and Tamara  couple one  are an ex-jailbird and indebted prostitute, respectively, working in a sleazy Viennese brothel, set on bank robbery as the only way out. Robert and Suzanne  couple two  an honest policeman and his wife, have created a middle-class, if childless, dream of a house in the rural Waldviertel, whose clean lines contrast with the ramshackle farm of old Hausner, Alexs ailing grandfather, across the way. Contrasts and comparisons are the rule, as Spielmanns slow-burning movie contrives  in an acceptable, rather than predictable, fashion  to combine the fates of the two couples, following the first pairs calamitous post-robbery getaway. <br />That story isnt the be-all-and-end-all in Spielmanns movie is obvious. Plot coincidences are declared; characters are placed plainly in convenient earshot of significant dialogue. Its physical, emotional and moral parallels, dichotomies and ironies hes after  and the light they may throw on our notions of revenge, guilt and restitution, together with subtler shafts on class and gender, home and family, secular transgression and Christian sin. Its an open work: suggestive rather than conclusive; grave, without being heavy; thoughtful, rather than deep  but also too vague and finally unsatisfying. Its boosted, however, by a set of affecting, low-key realist performances  notably that of Johannes Krisch as the uncouth Alex  and enriched by some superbly lit images by cinematographer Martin Gschlacht.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When the struggling symphony orchestra in which he plays the cello finally disbands, debt-ridden Daigo (Masahiro Motoki) returns to the small rural community where his late mother ran a caf and begins looking for work. Answering a newspaper ad for what he thinks is a travel company (hence Departures), he stumbles into an unlikely new job helping prepare the dead for funeral rites. His attitude to this is pretty much like our own and everyone elses  a certain discomfort  leaving him unsure how to break the news to his missus (Ryoko Hirosue). His sagacious boss (Tsutomu Yamazaki), however, soon helps him to realise that his unfairly maligned job can bring comfort to the living and the dead.<br />Its no surprise to learn that Daigo has his own unresolved emotional issues (ye olde absent-father scenario), but then again, director Yojiro Takita clearly has a deep-rooted fear of wrong-footing the audience, hence his determination to foreshadow every story development to the point of over-obviousness. Somewhat depressing to think that this won him the Oscar for Best Foreign Film, since this would-be touching drama mainly illustrates how thudding literalism beats any subtlety out of highly promising material. The movie gestures towards deep emotions, but an abiding soft-grained superficiality effectively insulates us from the piercing realities of grief. That said, Yamazaki is wonderful as the minence grise of corpse preparation  until Joe Hisaishis appalling score smothers everything in a string-heavy sludge. Disappointing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The extraordinarily dextrous woodland creatures in this live actioner are not about to sit back while Brendan Frasers real-estate developer Dan Sanders bulldozes their habitat into obliteration, so they set out to make his life hell. Dan brushes off his first altercation with a poorly rendered CGI raccoon as a weird coincidence, but when his nights are disturbed by a magpie tapping on his display homes window and his car is zapped by skunks, he begins to suspect the animals have it in for him. And so it continues, until he snaps, war is waged and eco-conscious repentance and reconciliation beckon.<br />Fuzzy elements of Chuck Joness unruly style are evident in some of the more amusing scenes and Frasers not overly incompetent as the butt of so much schadenfreude. But, strewth, did they have to pad it out with so many repeated pratfalls and inconsequential guff? It should play well enough with the under tens, mind.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Clo from 5 to 7 (1962) was French new waver Agns Vardas second feature and is filled with the beauty of Pariss natural light, sharpened in a new print for a BFI season on the director. Hold on, pretty butterfly! says Clo (Corinne Marchand, pictured), a fretful and fame-occupied singer, to herself as she prepares to roam the city for two hours while awaiting a possibly momentous doctors verdict. Its experimental and free-wheeling in design  Varda gives us overlapping dialogue, parodic inserts, a documentarists eye mixed with a painters, found sound and Michel Legrands songs, and juxtaposes frippery with political reality. Quietly touching and profound, it epitomises the youthful delight Varda always shows for the tools at her disposal and her sensitive and easeful way of expressing the sways and shifts of life, love and desire.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>West Texas, 1980. Out hunting deer in the desert down by the Mexican border, Vietnam veteran Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) happens on a heap of carnage: torn-apart trucks, corpses of men and dogs, the bloody bodies of others whod be better off dead, and a case packed with cash: about $2 million. With no witnesses, and confident  he can handle himself, Moss opts to keep whats clearly payment in a drugs-handover gone wrong, and treat himself and wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) to a life considerably better than their trailer-park existence. Trouble is, psychopathic hitman Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) also wants the loot, and begins carefully hunting the hunter, in turn pursued by veteran sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who cant help feeling the worlds turning more crazily violent.<br /></p><p>The Coens first outright adaptation is of a Cormac McCarthy novel so attuned to them that the film feels  at least until the final few scenes  as if its based on one of their own original screenplays: Blood Simple meets Fargo, almost. For all its fidelity to its source, however, itd be wrong to think it merely an illustration. The Coens meticulously select the most filmic moments of McCarthys terse, gripping book; they trim the sheriffs nostalgic reveries and philosophising, embellish and enhance the action, and succeed overall in transforming the novels economic descriptions into a full-blown world populated by vivid, plausible characters.<br /></p><p>Most impressive, they find a cinematic equivalent to McCarthys language: his narrative ellipses, play with point of view, and structural concerns such as the exploration of the similarities and differences between Moss, Chigurh and Bell. Certain virtuoso sequences feel near-abstract in their focus on objects, sounds, light, colour or camera angle rather than on human presence. As in Barton Fink or Fargo, the Coens prove that properly innovative artistry and engrossing entertainment can co-exist to utterly compelling effect.Notwithstanding much marvellous deadpan humour, this is one of their darkest efforts: Chigurh, especially, is a nightmarish creation, polite manners and pageboy bob perversely accentuating the volatility in his strangely logical head. Roger Deakins superb camerawork, top-grade performances all round, and understated, assured direction ensure the film exerts a grip from start to end. A masterly tale of the good, the deranged and the doomed that inflects the raw violence of the west with a wry acknowledgement of the demise of codes of honour, this is frighteningly intelligent and imaginative.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Since his first film, Xiao Wu in 1997, and with later works such as Unknown Pleasures and Still Life, Jia Zhangke has built a reputation as a leading chronicler of a changing China. The 40-year-old filmmaker from Shanxi Province is an independent voice, popular with festivals and cinemas across the globe, who works on the borders between documentary and fiction <br />and communicates the shifting landscapes of his country through the most personal of stories.<br />Jias new film, 24 City, is a documentary of sorts. Yet thats not a helpful tag for his invigorating collage of styles, sequences and suggestions, and the films great surprise is how he finds poetry and music in a subject that could easily be dry and mundane. Its focus is a formerly secret munitions factory, known as Factory 420 or the Chengfa Group, in the city of Chengdu in Sichuan Province. The factory moved, along with its workers, from distant Shenyang in 1958 and, at the time of filming, is being demolished and rebuilt as apartments and offices.<br />The factory, we come to feel, is a microcosm of China and the countrys stresses, strains and movements over the past 50 years, and once this feeling becomes apparent the film takes on a relevance that makes you look for greater meaning in each of its crisp, HD images. Jia tells the story of Factory 420 through nine interviews, each of them case studies of sorts, but he adds another layer of imagination and intrigue by having four of these nine interviewees played by actors, all of them, including Joan Chen and Zhao Tao, recognisable to Chinese audiences.<br />And the talking heads are only part of the story. Its the footage that Jia gives us between these interviews, informative and moving as they are, that is most captivating and illuminating: a crowd of workers singing at a company meeting; an ex-worker walking past a rusty military plane carrying her own drip; a scene of trees in bloom which, as the camera rises higher, turns out to be a painted wall in front of a building site. Add to this the central place that Jia gives to extracts from songs and poems, including two by WB Yeats, and the film takes on an operatic feel, moving between euphoria for the new and lament for the lost.<br />The films power is gradual, rather than immediate. Some of the interviews drag a little, and the mixing of real interviewees with actors causes some jarring of tone. But, that warning aside, the film should prove a winner for anyone interested in the new China and Jias playful approach to what makes a documentary.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p><i>(Please note: many cinemas are <b>not</b> showing this film in the 3D version. Please check with venue to avoid disappointment.) </i></p><p>This is why 3D was invented: an eye-popping re-make of the 1981 slasher movie that blends old-school body count horror with bleeding-edge 3D effects. Patrick Lussiers re-working of the censor-savaged Canadian original soon gets down to business, bumping off a string of well-drawn characters in imaginatively gory ways.<br /><br />As Valentines Day approaches, a Pennsylvania town fears the closure of its mine, where ten years before an accident prompted a rampage by the sole survivor, Harry Warden. Now the killer is back, impaling victims on his pickaxe. But is this Harry a ghost or a copycat? Lussier keeps us guessing with a plot that is more psychological than supernatural. There is some repetition and over-plotting, but a central love triangle is thankfully more than a framework for the throwback stalk and slash set-pieces.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Cover your eyes: is this another well-loved sitcom dying an embarrassing death on the big screen? Far from it  Armando Iannucci has turned his satirical series The Thick of It into a film that sparkles with the same filthy humour, spoken by the same morally empty vessels in the same mundane corridors of power that marked the brilliant TV version. Shaky cameras, bad suits and crappy furnishings dont automatically equal documentary-style reality  but combined with smart performances and a politically astute script that wisely sidesteps specifics but feeds on the tenor of real events, they go a long way to achieving it. Its also a welcome celebration of polished and engaged comic writing that very rarely feels laboured and always feels that it has a serious point to make amid the ample gags.<br />Iannucci and his team give the world of The Thick of It a filmic spin by unfolding their story on either side of the Atlantic and guessing what may happen behind closed doors in Whitehall and Washington DC in the lead up to a contentious conflict in the Middle East. But much is familiar. Peter Capaldi returns as the Prime Ministerial attack dog Malcolm Tucker  think Alastair Campbell with rabies  and Chris Addison is again an ineffective Whitehall flunky whose lacks of scruples extend to blaming infidelity on his peacenik tendencies.<br /><br />Tom Hollander very effectively picks up where Chris Langham left off: a fall guy for the conspiracies and gags of others, hes the new, inexperienced, vaguely idealistic but vain Secretary of State for International Development who becomes a pawn for hawks and doves on either side of the pond when he accidentally supports and then denounces war in two disastrous media appearances. In Washington, James Gandolfini offers one of the films few moral centres as an army general against conflict because hes been there and knows its horrific.<br />Its not easy to transfer the spirit of a half-hour show to a feature film, and there are some chapters that drag, especially when Capaldi, who gets all the best lines, disappears from view. But mostly Iannucci keeps the pace up with snappy twists and turns, a tone that mixes screwball with precise observation and by keeping a keen eye on the performances of even minor characters, such as the over-achieving, barely legal automatons that pepper the offices of Washington. Its a film that is both insanely funny and a desperate cry for sanity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This is a brutal, mesmerising film from Dane Nicolas Winding Refn (Pusher, Bronson), dominated by Mads Mikkelsen as a mute fighter, whose journey from twelfth-century Scotland to a strange New World is an odyssey of self-realisation. Enslaved by a pagan Scottish clan chieftain, the nameless warrior is chained and forced to fight to the death in hand-to-hand bouts staged for amusement and betting. Escaping with the help of a young boy, who names him One-Eye, the warrior learns to use weapons and joins a band of Vikings, but these are Christian converts bound for Jerusalem to reclaim the city for their faith. Their ship, however, is enveloped by a mysterious mist, which finally lifts to reveal an unknown land. Lost, hungry and under attack from the natives, the Viking converts lose their faith and lose their minds, turning on one another  but the enigmatic One-Eye discovers his destiny and embraces his essential self. <br />There are shades here of Terrence Malicks elemental feel for landscape, the doomed colonial enterprise of Werner Herzogs Aguirre, Wrath of God and Vincent Wards visionary The Navigator: A Medieval Odyssey, yet Refn makes this hypnotic, dreamlike film entirely his own. The pace slows like a fighters heart in the second half, demanding an act of faith that some may find hard after the early intensity.

      <review><![CDATA[This richly textured, wholly involving, unconventional biographical portrait illustrates the central irony in the life of poet and essayist Joseph Brodsky, who spent his youth bridling against the Soviet system, but when finally expelled to pursue a successful career in the US, was then consumed by nostalgia for the old country. Having won the Nobel Prize for Literature, Brodsky died in 1996 an American citizen without ever returning home  so Khrzhanovskiys film takes that sentimental journey for him, as we follow lookalike actor Grigoriy Diyatkovskiys encounter with the Leningrad of the Soviet era (almost unrecognisable as the St Petersburg of today) that shaped Brodsky as writer and Russian. Even those new to his work will surely be drawn in by the storytelling generosity on view. <br />One moment its affectionately earthy Fellini-esque reminiscence, the next its phantasmagorical animation echoing Chagall and Gilliam, while throughout the sense of place is palpable, glimpses of the now decaying Brodsky family picturing the still sadness of empty rooms with the elegiac frisson of a Tarkovsky.<br />The Russian director Andrey Khrzhanovskiy is actually an award-winning animator, which explains the graphical flights of fancy as, say, musical instruments float skywards over old Leningrad. True, his films hustle and bustle sometimes feels like too much to take in at once, <br />yet its heavy payload of literary quotations, philosophical argument and classical music is also perhaps an act of faith in an intelligent audience. If you want the facts, try Wikipedia, but this swirl of memory and imagination captures the essential poetry and struggles of a great artist torn between home and freedom.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its a time-honoured tradition among ageing rock stars with dwindling audiences to go back to the time that made them famous: nostalgia sells.<br /><br />Now John Cusack is applying the same shtick to movies: having tried his luck as both action hero and romantic lead, with Hot Tub Time Machine, Cusack returns to the slapdash, high concept 80s comedies that made him famous. And concepts dont come much higher than this: following a mysterious incident with an outdoor Jacuzzi and a can of nuclear-powered Russian energy drink, Adam (Cusack) and his three friends find themselves rocketed into the past, forced to relive the craziest night of their teenage lives before they can find a way back to the good old twenty-first century.<br />Hot Tub Time Machine conforms a little too closely to the post-The Hangover comedy template of a gang of drunk middle-aged losers with loud voices, bad attitudes and dubious ideas about women. But where this film scores over The Hangover is in the script, which replaces brash overconfidence with a looser narrative structure and a shaggier, more playful sense of humour.<br />It also does a great job of recreating the style and content of the 80s comedies it so lovingly pastiches, namely girls with big hair, pounding synth music and skisuit-wearing preppy douchebag villains. Giving his most charming performance in years, Cusack keeps the film sweet-natured when his more outrageous co-star Rob Corddry threatens to go overboard. No masterpiece, perhaps, but Hot Tub Time Machine is post-pub perfection.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Heres another contemporary British drama that would have been better made for TV and trimmed down to a lean 60 minutes. Theres no problem with the acting. Ian Hart is faultless as Liverpool painter and decorator Joe  feckless, funny, heart somewhere near the right place  who ran out on his young family years ago. Newcomer Kyle Ward plays his son Robbie, now 14 and also a dad after getting a girl from school pregnant. Father and son havent seen each other for years, but Robbie recognises dad from the photos when he spots him on the street. The humour in these early scenes is all warmth and sharp edges and this could have been an acute little film about broken families. Instead  and maybe its the pressure to write it bigger-than-life for the big screen  the plot becomes more outlandish as Robbie goes on the run with his baby after a fight, with dad close behind. None of it is believable for a minute.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Bollywoods latest excuse for a comical assault on our sensibilities amounts to little more than a serious embarrassment. The thin plot involves shameless homages to at least five Hollywood comedies including Night at the Museum, Meet the Parents and, um, You, Me and Dupree. Will goofy Aarush (Kumar) find true love with Sandy (Padukone) or with his childhood buddy Bob (Deshmukh)? Spiced up with semi-nude A-list leads, inexplicable exotic locations and with cameos from a tiger, a parrot and the Royal family, this represents everything thats reprehensible about commercial Hindi cinema. Most objectionable is the use of a running gay gag and a black baby to evoke laughter. Contrary to what one of its five songs says, I know what you should do: stay away from this loser!]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In Wes Cravens 1984 original, Nancy warned her boyfriend Glen, a young Johnny Depp: Whatever happens, dont fall asleep. Heed this warning if you see this tedious reimagining of Cravens seminal slasher movie, because youll be struggling to stay awake. Inheriting Freddy Kruegers iconic fedora and striped sweater from Robert Englund, former child star Jackie Earle Haley makes what he can of a hand-me-down role, slicing his way into the dreams of suburban teenagers. That said, Haleys CGI-enhanced make-up makes more of an impression than his weak presence, scary voice or lame one-liners.<br /><br />After their friend is killed by an invisible attacker, emo girl Nancy (Rooney Mara) and misfit Quentin (Kyle Gallner) are convinced that her death is connected to a nightmare theyve all been having and a dark Freddy Krueger-related secret their parents have kept from them  a secret the kids have all, in a convenient act of collective amnesia, repressed since nursery school. Now Freddy is back, invading their dreams and threatening to kill them in their sleep.<br /><br />The makers clearly couldnt decide between a prequel or remake, so they and first-time director Samuel Bayer have jammed both together. Heather Langenkamps wimpy portrayal of Nancy was the originals weak point, and here Maras Nancy slips between the somnambulant and the catatonic. This is the worst yet from Michael Bays horror production company Platinum Dunes, which also brought you rubbish re-makes of Halloween and Friday the 13th.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The terrorisation of Peruvian women during the Shining Path campaigns of the 1980s is the troubling background to Peruvian director Claudia Llosas frank, free-floating drama about the power of folk myth on young minds. As a dying woman sings of being gang raped and forced to eat the severed penis of her dead lover, we learn that her chronically demure daughter Fausta (Magaly Solier) has a potato lodged in her vagina as a crude form of contraception. Influenced by traditional songs and rituals, Faustina is repulsed by men, and the film tells of a gradual relaxing of sexual tensions within her as she attempts to bankroll her late mothers funeral by working for a neurotic female composer. Concentrating on the implications of honouring family tradition as well as the occasional hokiness of those same traditions, Llosa sensitively captures the deep-rooted poetry of this system of beliefs while allowing us the space to assess its cultural and spiritual merits.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Jean-Paul Belmondo mooches up to Samuel Fuller at a cocktail party and, naturally, asks him his thoughts on cinema. Fuller replies: Film is like a battleground. Love. Hate. Action. Violence. Death. In one word: Emotions. His succinct and, lets be honest, utterly hip rejoinder fluently captures what were about to undergo with Godards mischievous, free-associative tenth film, Pierrot le Fou, re-released here in a restored print as part of the BFIs continuing Nouvelle Vague season. <br />The party ends and were launched into the lunatic orbit of Belmondos Ferdinand and Anna Karinas Marianne: he a rakish, unemployed adman choking on consumerist jargon and bourgeois conformity, she a happy-clappy coquette with unspecified links to an underground military faction. Each is an impulsive, alienated, despairing soul who finds solace in the others desire for chaos and withdrawal. They flee Paris for the south of France in a hail of gunfire and Gauloises. They converse in disjointed, inhumanly droll patter, break into song, duff up gas station attendants and eagerly concoct a new civilisation on a deserted beach. Then, as their relationship begins to fray, it all goes horribly wrong<br />Basing his film ever so loosely on Lionel Whites pulp crime novel Obsession, Godard inventively drapes genre pastiche, literary references, flash inserts and cheeky agitprop over a robust Bonnie and Clyde-like framework to deliver a film which, in spirit, feels like both the sum total of his past work and an exhilarating sign of things to come. Its a wild-eyed, everything-in-the-pot cross-processing of artistic, cinematic, political and personal concerns, where the story stutters, splinters and infuriates its way to an explosive finale. Taken as a whole, were right back to that word again: emotions.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Ironies abound in the latest by Chinas greatest contemporary cinematic chronicler Jia Zhangke: Theres politics in every one of cinematographer Yu Likwais superbly composed HD frames, but its feel that the former is after. And in the half-drowned town of Fengjie  the victim of the Yangtze river Three Gorges Project and capitalism as well as being the new home of rural Shanxi construction worker Han (Han Sanming)  the feeling isnt good. </p><p>Han is looking for his estranged wife and daughter; while, in another part of town, as if to show missed-connections are no male preserve, nurse Hong (Zhao Tao) is looking for an absentee husband. Meanwhile, the Yangtze flows on; they both end up gazing out to it, in search of answers to questions wider than the immediate.</p><p>Arguably, Still Life marks a change for Jia, with a sharpening focus reflecting the translation of his observational eye from the particular modes, dilemmas and adaptations pertaining to his home province of Shanxi to the even faster-changing realities of the more industrialised Chinese heartland. But here  from the opening pan around the rolling community of the immigrants boat through the films mini-odyssey among the lived-in spaces taking occupancy during the hastening phases of deconstruction and erection  what is unchanged is Jias unique ability to let us participate in peoples experience. </p><p>In Still Life the directors assurance is such that the barriers between documentary and fictional film are made to seem an irrelevance; you may find his films intimations of commonality  what we share as human beings  will surprise and move you in unexpected ways.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Theres already been so much said, written and broadcast about Joy Division and the Factory Records story that you could be forgiven for not having the patience to wade through yet another chapter in the story of Tony Wilson and the rest of the gobby cast that strode the Manchester stage of the 70s and 80s. From 24 Hour Party People to the recent coverage of Wilsons death to a new documentary on the box only the other week, this tale of bands, big egos and bad business sense has an appeal way beyond its roots. The photographer Anton Corbijn has now added Control to the throng, and his contribution  a black and white study of the life and death of Ian Curtis  is more sombre and grounded and less playful than the comic spins weve come to expect. Watching the film, one is left with a sense of Ian Curtis as the subject for an intense photographic study as much as a figure ripe for probing drama. There are plenty of shots of Curtis walking down the street or smoking a fag or looking out of windows. The films real energy and excitement are in the live scenes, which are unfussy, extended and electric.</p><p>Suicide and the lives of artists are two of the toughest subjects for cinema to grapple with, and Control squares up bravely to both. Weve seen Curtis played before as an unlikeable, spikey presence by Sean Harris in 24 Hour Party People. In contrast, Sam Rileys Curtis is a different animal. Hes quiet, brooding, passive, unless hes on stage, when Riley nails his possessed, jolty act. Those familiar with Winterbottoms earlier film will recognise much here: Curtis demanding the attention of Tony Wilson in a pub; the signing of the bands record contract in blood; their appearance on Granada TV; skinheads invading a gig; Curtis epilepsy; his suicide.</p><p>Whats new is that Corbijn is also concerned  with Curtis home life. This is hardly surprising seeing as the film has its origins in Touching From a Distance, the memoir of Deborah Curtis, his wife, and the films main interest  is the strain of marriage on a young man who got hitched early and then falls in love with a Belgian groupie, Annik Honor (Alexandra Maria Lara), who, when interviewing the band for a fanzine, utters the delicious line: Tell me about Macclesfield.</p><p>Corbijns film may be about the domestic life of Curtis as much as the public, yet he keeps a distance from the grit of the story. To his credit, this means that no wild biographical ideas plague his film, but theres also a gap between the film and the filmed thats a little unsatisfying. Maybe its the most honest approach  who, really, ever knows why someone kills themselves? There are suggestions here, but nothing so crude as a definitive answer.</p>]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[The Romance of Astrea and Celadon]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[The freshest and loveliest film this week is this bucolic romance from the 88-year-old French director Eric Rohmer. His latest film  and possible last of a series of 25 features stretching back to 1959s Le Signe du Lion  is an adaptation of a very early novel (written in 1610 by Honor dUrf), a fabulous tale of love, heartbreak and cross-dressing among young shepherds and nymphs in fifth-century Gaul.<br />The story is simple and engaging: dark, dusky-eyed Celadon (Andy Gillet) throws himself in the river when blond-tressed lover Astrea (Stphanie Crayencour) rejects his protestations of innocence of infidelity, but survives to receive a fundamental sentimental education, not least at the sensuous hands of a party of diaphanous nymphs. But, as ever with Rohmer, <br />its tale of innocence and experience, fidelity, self-delusion and social constraint is deepened by a script of the subtlest construction, and performances of straightforward emotional truth. <br />That is not to say that Rohmer has abandoned his perennial concerns  notably to fashion a cinematic arena where the paradoxes of life  those between the heart and head, the body and the soul, sex and love  can be played out. <br />Careful to preface his portrait of pagan/romanised peoples as seventeenth-century readers imagined them, he allows himself to indulge in playful (almost Brechtian) anachronisms which enable us to examine our present anxieties, artistic conventions and philosophical conundrums in the context of our shared past and our future. Its marvellous how his films exemplary, pared-down pictorial mise-en-scne (cloisters for the druids, sylvan glades for the lovers) so undemonstratively bypasses the confused clutter of much of modern film, but it is the wisdom, passion, joy and hope with which he invests the film that makes it so terribly moving.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Memory is dynamic Its alive. This animated documentary, for which Israeli filmmaker Ari Folmans wizard colleague, the artist David Polonsky, dazzlingly illustrates talking-head recollections and reconstructions of a past war, comes across like a therapy session made vivid with bizarre, expressionist colours and the jolty, episodic mood of remembrance.<br /><br />The film is a cathartic trip down memory lane for Folman  only he doesnt know where hes going. As a young soldier, he took part in Israels 1982 invasion of Lebanon and was in Beirut when the Lebanese Christian militia known as Phalangists murdered 800 Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps  perhaps with the approval of the Israeli army. It was a massacre that caused Ariel Sharon, Israels defence minister, to resign from his post when an inquiry found him indirectly responsible for the deaths.<br /><br />Then and now, Folman puts himself centre-stage  which means hes always dancing on the edge of self-indulgence. Its a game that neatly frames a ramshackle tale but also grates the more its emphasised. Now in his forties, this urbane, bearded character visits other lucid contemporaries to hear their versions of the experience they shared. Theres a guy living in Holland whos made a fortune selling falafel. Theres the war correspondent Ron Ben-Yishai, who marched gung-ho, John Simpson-like into Beirut. Theres a guy whose talk is oddly associative: he talks of the patchouli scent, a sort of aftershave, that everyone was wearing at the time of the war. For him, like Folmans inability to remember much at all, its the lasting gift of the conflict.<br />Presumably Folman filmed all these interviews, later animating them with the events of which each interviewee speaks, so blurring the line between fact and fiction and stressing the power and failings of memory. But take away the unusual form of illustration and the model is that of a traditional, flashback-driven, dramatised doc. In fact, the animation is the films strength: its revelatory, from the portrayal of dreamy, gold-and-black-coloured episodes of soldiers bathing in the sea with distant flares lighting up Beirut to more realist depictions of death such as when a soldier driving a tank suddenly takes a fatal bullet.<br /><br />Its this sort of erratic, ground-level experience that Folman focuses on the most; even the facts of the massacre take a back seat. He wants to show war as ridiculous, and his concern for the horrors and absurdities of battle feels fresh and affecting.<br />And yet, despite the grim subject, this is a beautiful film. A paradox? Only if you expect coherence  and Waltz with Bashir is anything but coherent, and pointedly so. Its recollection refracted  and then some. Its messy and unusual, not always gratifying, sometimes frustrating, always compelling.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[On Broadway in 2002 Baz Luhrmann moved the story to 1950s America, but this latest film of Puccinis operatic warhorse is more traditional. Detailed studio interiors recreate nineteenth-century Parisian bustle, as director Robert Dornhelm tries to illuminate the material from within. The result is approachable for newcomers, but with Dornhelms camera keeping a close watch on group dynamics, itll remind old hands to look beyond the creamy melodies. What emerges is a trenchant portrait of cash-strapped youngsters too beaten down to exploit opportunties for love. Star tenor Rolando Villazn shows a surprising deftness of touch, even if his glam leading lady Anna Netrebko looks too resilient to persuade as ailing seamstress Mimi. Their charismas centre-stage, though its serviceable rather than ecstatic.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Since 1974, Michael Peterson, who uses the name of Death Wish actor Charles Bronson, has been free from jail for only two short periods. The Luton-bred hard man first got seven years for robbery; most of the rest he accrued in prison for crimes ranging from kidnap to GBH. <br />The makers of this new film, in which Tom Hardy plays Peterson, offer a stylised, sympathy-craving portrait of the man, but its a shoddy and morally nasty film that leaves a terrible taste in the mouth. It takes us from Petersons childhood to the present via episodes in his life such as his incarceration in a mental hospital and the kidnapping of a prison art teacher. Much of it consists of brief, self-consciously arty but ultimately artless tableaux bolstered by voiceover or music, which betrays a flimsy, show-and-tell approach to filmmaking. <br />There are imaginary interludes of Bronson entertaining in a music hall, but these just suggest that Bronson craves fame: nothing too incisive there, then. One laughable sequence set at a prison party suggests an A Level theatre studies project after an outing to see One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest.<br />Theres a fatal tension between film and script: Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn (Pusher, Bleeder) brashly channels Kubrick, with slowmo tracking shots set to obvious classical or choral music and looking to lend poetry to violence, while Brock Norman Brocks pedestrian scenario is forever apologising for Petersons behaviour. Brock suggests that it doesnt matter if Bronson tries to kill or kidnap someone as long as that person is a paedophile or, in the case of the teacher, a fluffy liberal who peppers his speech with Spanish. <br />Hardy delivers a committed if showy performance, but there are some awful smaller turns which smell dangerously of homophobia. The whole thing made me want to scrub my brain with Vim.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Read an interview with Ephron here</i><br />If, as screenwriter and director Nora Ephron has done, you take two foodie memoirs, fold one into the other and add judicious amounts of sugar, the result is bound to make a viewer hungry  but for what? <br />Sure, there are close-ups of boeuf bourgignon and chocolate almond cake, and a lot of unfashionable drooling over butter, both in post-war Paris where Julia Child (Meryl Streep) learns French cooking and in post-9/11 Queens where Julie Powell (Amy Adams) cooks and blogs her way through Childs book; but the food isnt the point. Julia and Julie are both happily married women in search of something meaningful to do. Food, for them, isnt filling: its fulfilment.<br />The larger issues of food and cooking in a womans life are left on the side of the plate, but the bouncing back and forth between Julies poky American kitchen and Julias gracious Parisian one cant help but inspire comparisons. Can a Magimix and Instant Messaging really compensate for the glamour of real pearls, an authentic French cookery school and letters you can open? Worse, this Julia is largely a figment of Julies imagination, so her life is tiresomely close to perfect. Unlike her acolyte, Julia has no marital quarrels, no money problems, no dispiriting day job. Her  career has a selfless motive  the desire to teach Americans how to cook French food  while Julies is all about Julie. <br />The result is a film thats charming, funny  especially when Streep is on screen, broadcasting her superb impression of the tall, charismatic, high-pitched Child  but leaves you with a dissatisfaction with modern life that no culinary masterpiece can relieve.<br /><i>Read an interview with Ephron here</i><br />]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Documentaries]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[Since his passing in 1994, the image of maverick US comedian Bill Hicks has been adopted as a crude totem that equates chain-smoking and invective with a vague, post-punk defiance. As this exhaustive, moving documentary confirms, not only did Hickss fiery, ultra-articulate belligerence make him a rebel with a cause but he carried with him a permanent sadness relating to how his comedy was received and the state of the world. Painstakingly recreating the testimony of friends and family by manipulating and animating archive photographs, the directors tell Hickss story in a clear, linear fashion and never push for undue meaning.<br /><br />The breadth and quality of the archive is nothing short of astounding  theres even grainy VHS footage of his endless tours through dives such as The Comedy Pouch in Possum Ridge, Arkansas  so even those who shrug at his combative style of humour wont be able to deny that this is a model of detailed and distanced biographical filmmaking.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[From the legendary Another Girl, Another Planet (filmed on a Fisher Price camera) to his Ethan Hawke Hamlet and idiosyncratic doc on photographer William Eggleston, filmmaker Michael Almereyda has trodden a mazy path. And hes kept a handycam with him every step of the way, filtering highlights from his worldwide travels over the past decade into this engaging video collage. Theres no connecting narrative or contextualising captions, just a series of twilight skies, goofing kids, protests in Iran, trapeze artistes, a new baby, old geezers dipping in the Irish Sea it goes on. Granted, this sounds like a flung-together jumble, but Almereyda really does have an eye for colour, movement, absurdity and fleeting melancholy. Crucially, he resists overlaying everything with music telling us what to think, and the unpredictable location sound (But first I need my magic hat quoth one wee tot) encourages us to keep eyes and ears open. Perhaps just a touch overlong, but active viewership is a prerequisite for this disarming, ad hoc journey of discovery.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Matters of the heart, flesh and mind conflict in this thoughtful, tense and saddening study of lust and repression among Jerusalems ultra-Orthodox Jews, a community presented by talented young Israeli director Haim Tabakman as an enclosed and self-regulating bubble. Aaron (Zohar Strauss), a shy butcher, husband and father in his late thirties, reopens his business after his fathers death and accepts Ezri (Ran Danker), a secretive religious student, as an apprentice after the younger man wanders into his shop, reeling from his own, mysterious troubles. <br />Aarons nervous wranglings with scriptural doctrine at local prayer meetings suggest a man ill at ease with himself, while back at the shop Aaron teaches Ezri his trade, lets him sleep in the back room, invites him for meals with his wife and kids and gradually becomes closer to him, much to the dismay of his peers who suggest that he should have nothing to do with the outsider and seem to suspect what we know: that Aaron and Ezri are in a sexual relationship.<br /><br />Tabakmans debut film is a grind at first. Why are we observing these men in this dull shop in this oppressive corner of Jerusalem? What, to be frank, is going on? But as the risk builds, Eyes Wide Open becomes a gripping tale of a man fighting with himself, his community and religion. Tabakman is excellent at capturing both the increasing claustrophobia of the situation and Aarons apparent obliviousness (the oblivion of love?) to whats going on around him, not least with a brilliant shot that captures in the window of a minibus the reflection of a crowd outside Aarons shop.<br /><br />Slow and often silent, its an extraordinarily disciplined film (the photography alone is impressively careful and controlled) that respects, if not honours, the milieu of its story by accepting that liberation has bounds and that leaving it all behind  breaking free  is the stuff of movies, not life.]]></review>

The main case studies are General Motors, Polaroid and Barclays, all of which withdrew from the country, and Shell, which did not. The calibre of the interviewees  including former top-level executives from all these corporations as well as key anti-apartheid campaigners  is high, and Field offers a clear and rousing study of how economic sanctions, initated by grassroots protests, can have a significant political effect  especially when the boards of corporations find themselves in a forced position of embarrassment.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[I ended up feeling a bit sorry for Michael Caine by the time this hateful vigilante flick set in modern-day London came to a close. Did the old boy know what he was getting into? The funny thing is that Harry Brown, bar a violent prologue, begins fairly soberly, even reflectively, as if the makers were thinking more of All or Nothing than Death Wish. Harry (Caine, below) is a widower who shuffles around a crumbling housing estate with only fellow army vet Leonard (David Bradley) for company. But life changes when Leonard falls prey to the hoodies who linger in the local underpass. When distraught Harry gets short shrift from the police (badly written, and poorly played by Emily Mortimer and Charlie Creed-Miles), he decides to take the law into his own hands and drives this already wobbly wagon straight into hysterical genre territory. By now, all you can do is sigh, laugh and try not to get upset at the stupidity of it all.<br />Although it takes a while before Harry Brown shows its true colours, therea a vulgar whiff from the off: in the first seconds of this debut from director Daniel Barber (who, technically, shows a fair amount of talent) we watch grainy mobile footage of a kid on a scooter as he confronts a young mum and shoots her dead before he comes a cropper himself on the road. Its horrible stuff, but there must be a good reason for it, surely?<br />As it turns out, this scene is a random first glimpse of a warped portrait of our city thats straight out of the Daily Mail  a place where your granny might get shot, stabbed or battered at every turn. Its also the first hint of the sick ideology of the film, in which ill-informed pessimism is bolstered by childish ideas of revenge. Theres always a punishment around the corner, not only to avenge bad behaviour but also to give the makers sneaky licence to indulge in violence. As narrative  and moral  maths go, this is a cooking of the books that sidesteps any smart commentary on real life.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Media hysteria is Chris Morriss specialist subject. More than 15 years later, its still barely possible to watch an ITV news bulletin without thinking of The Day Today, home to Peter OHanraha-hanrahan and some of the most bombastic news graphics known to man. Then with Brass Eye, Morris took further aim at the medias uncanny ability to whip up a frenzy about any old nonsense and persuade gullible celebs like Noel Edmonds and Phil Collins to join them for the ride.<br />Four Lions is Morriss first feature film, written with Peep Show scribes Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, and is no less concerned with the medias bending of the truth, even if its model is more The Young Ones than Newsnight. So much has been said about homegrown terrorism (like its some sort of cannabis plant) that Morris counters the chatter not by reconstructing and mocking the reporting of falsehoods in the style of The Day Today or Brass Eye but by making a knockabout comedy about five wannabe jihadis from Sheffield.<br />Morris wants us to point and laugh at these twits: Omar (Riz Ahmed), a family man, outwardly sensible, who travels to Afghanistan and fires a missile launcher the wrong way round; Barry (Nigel Lindsay), a white convert and angry hothead who wants to bomb mosques to make Muslims rise up; Fessel (Adeel Akhtar), a dopey fool with mud for brains who pretends to be from the IRA when buying chemicals; Waj (Kayvan Novak), an infantile and thick brute who sees heaven like the rubber-dinghy rapids ride at Alton Towers and views life through an Xbox; and Hassan (Arsher Ali), a rapping joker who Barry meets when he reveals a bomb belt of party poppers at a public political debate.<br />We follow these misguided clowns as they persuade a dumb neighbour theyre a band; as they try to make bombs; as they sing Toploader on the way down the M1; and as they try to blow themselves up dressed as fun runners in the London marathon. The film opens with a botched attempt to record a martyrs video and continues in the same absurdist spirit. The film looks as cheap as these guys homemade bombs; it has a loose, freewheeling air, although the humour of the script is as crafted and honed as anything in Peep Show or The Thick of It and delights in similar wordplay: Bin Laden becomes some Paki Steptoe; two police marksmen argue over whether the Honey Monster is a bear; and clueless Barry spits: Jews invented spark plugs to control global traffic.<br />Those expecting slick, serious-minded satire might be a little surprised: Morris and his team dress their sharp observations and savage one-liners in the clothes of slapstick pratfalls and broad gags. Many filmmakers who undertook the level of research that Morris claims to have done before making Four Lions would have come up with a work of sombre realism that tried to explain its protagonists motivations and make us understand them more. Morris might achieve the latter, and theres a serious, even moving, tone behind the gags, but theres nothing sombre or even very real about Four Lions. Its scrappy and chaotic. Some scenes are hilarious; some are too loopy or uncomfortable to provoke laughs; all strive to achieve something genuinely unusual and essentially true.<br />Obviously, just to make a comedy about terrorists is daring. But whats most bold about Four Lions is not the gags at the expense of these fools (they feel fully justified) or the finger-pointing at the similar stupidity and incompetence of the authorities. No  its the decision to see the world from these lads point of view, not ours.<br />This means that we run along, laughing, with the quiet suggestion that maybe our country is, as they say, just a little bit, well, shit. The films opening shot looks like a mosque at night but turns out to be the uninspiring dome of a dull shopping centre where Omar works in security. Repeated establishing shots of a top-flat bomb factory place it next to a grim flyover on the edge of a city. We might not agree with the cry Lets bomb Boots!, but Fuck Mini Babybel! has an oddly rousing ring to it by the end of this uneasy, surprising sort-of-comedy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Anyone paying a wee bit of attention to pop culture over the past few years cant have helped but notice the renaissance of burlesque: the slinky demi-monde of fascinators and feather fans, tassels and teases has taken a brand of cheesecake glamour from retro-scene niche into the heart of the mainstream (see Kylie, Christina et al). Fronted by one of the neo-burlesque scenes biggest stars, Immodesty Blaize, this doc offers a survey of the forms history, conventions and current revival: theres historical context from academics, ribald anecdotage from mid-century American veterans such as Satans Angel and Lily Anne Rose and testimony from current stars like Dirty Martini and Kitten De Ville about performer camaraderie, intensive production work and the uses of tradition. The extended sequences of Blaize and others in performance are often clumsily composed and the consideration of the forms sexual politics and contemporary appeal remains, er, scanty. But overall, this is a solid if scattershot primer on a scene that seems here to stay.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its easy to see why Andrew Shortells confused psychological thriller has been on the shelf for three years. Often bordering on the hysterical, but never remotely scary or interesting, it focuses on an unstable young woman, Rosalyn (Sara Foster), and her relationship to the recent murders of women by a claw-hammer-wielding serial killer dubbed the Night Hawk. While working alone at night in the records section of a hospital, Ros tries to unravel the truth  but it is she who slowly unravels.<br /><br />Fosters overwrought, chain-smoking Rosalyn is counterbalanced by Cary Elwess calm, sympathetic shrink and Gabriel Manns oddly James Spader-like turn as Rosalyns frustrated boyfriend. But sympathetic or not, both the good doctor and the bad boyfriend join the list of suspects, alongside a creepy security guard, an unshaven detective and a concerned co-worker. What look like reshoots, the lazy use of child abuse as character motivation, and the J-horror-style flash-frames, CCTV footage and explanatory flashbacks, all reek of desperation.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[J-Lo is back with another girl-next-door act (wearing eight-inch Louboutin heels, naturally). In this try-hard New York romcom she plays Zoe, a pet-shop-owner-from-the-block, pushing 40, clock ticking. With not the whiff of a man in sight, she activates plan B: artificial insemination. Then, what do you know, she meets Mr Right (Alex OLoughlin) on her way home from the clinic. Its raining and they jump into the same taxi  it happens all the time in the movies, phoney contrived ones at least.<br />This screams J-Lo comeback vehicle  as you can tell from the casting of Mr Right. Alex who? Apparently hes an Australian actor who has been on the telly (a back-up for John Cusack?). Its a sparkless match. He is meant to be a farmer, which involves a lot of standing around looking hot at a produce market. All the usual rom-com accessories come as standard: sassy BF, calamitous first date, cutesy pet dog (for double-cuteness this one is wheelchair bound).<br /> Actually, the dog is crucial to one of the films best gags: a dog-ate-my-pregnancy-test set- up. Otherwise its money for old rope: gynaecology  speculums, legs akimbo  and pregnancy gags, plus a circa-1976 stereotype of a dippy single-mothers support group. If this is a comeback, lets hope J-Los got something else up her sleeve. Id love to see her ditching the nice-nicey routine and sinking her teeth into a juicy super-bitch.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[With the election looming, 80s anti-fascist demonstrations back in the news and controversy over stop-and-search still raging, the release of Sus is auspicious. Based on Barrie Keefes 1979 stage play, this claustrophobic, intense three-hander was inspired by the late 70s law that gave police officers the right to detain on suspicion anyone they saw fit, usually young black men. Betraying its theatrical origins, the film takes place in a single police interview room on election night, as thuggish Thatcherite cops Karn (Ralph Brown) and Wilby (Rafe Spall) attempt, by any means, to extract a confession from unemployed labourer Delroy (Clint Dyer) following the unexplained death of his wife. Its morally one-sided and the dialogue and acting tends towards the mannered and overblown  Spall in particular comes off like a Fast Show bad-cop parody at times. But overall this is a well structured, emotionally rigorous piece of filmmaking, and a timely reminder of the dangers of unchecked police power.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[While 1940s cinema was packed with devious dames, few can match Peggy Cumminss hellcat sharpshooter Laurie Starr for sheer manipulative allure. Meeting Laurie at a small-town carny, clean-cut gun nut Bart (a perplexed John Dall) is transfixed by her charms and prowess with a pistol. The two cut a swathe through the Southern states, holding up banks and evading a tightening police dragnet.<br />Gun Crazy is a magnificently enjoyable film, distinguished by Joseph H Lewiss restless, catch-all directorial style; visually, the film ranges from classic gritty noir to hyperstylised modern gothic, to a startling single-take hold-up sequence shot on crowded streets. The filmmakers never miss a chance for a sly Freudian aside: from Barts little problem with guns (he can point, but he cant shoot) to Lauries zealous lust for control, Gun Crazy is awash with hysterical symbolism. A genuine treat.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The poster for this moving and poetic Italian film about Sicilian immigrants coming to America at the turn of the twentieth century offers a glimpse of a sight that director Emanuele Crialese never shows us: the skyline of a nascent New York City. It was probably a financial decision as much as a creative one to detain us indoors  or, at least, on-deck  from the moment a packed and creaking ship slides away from the quay at Palermo until the films end in the detention centre on Ellis Island (actually filmed in an old hotel in Buenos Aires). Nevertheless, this hermetic approach proves particularly powerful when a group of Italian men awaiting approval from US immigration clamber on to a window-sill and peer across the Hudson, describing their view of huge church towers in the distance. We share their sense of wonder, but the view of the citys skyscrapers is all theirs to enjoy.<br />But its our turn to feel displaced first as the film opens in Sicily and peasants Salvatore (Vincenzo Amato) and his young son Angelo Mancuso (Francesco Casisa) climb a barren, cloud-hugged hill, each with a stone clasped between his jaws, to consult a weather-beaten crucifix as to whether they should venture to the New World or not. Its a mysterious scene, steeped in both historical and cultural distance, thats graced with a striking, overhead approach to photography to which cinematographer Agns Godard returns several times, not least for a fantastic shot of the ship leaving the dock in Sicily in an echo of the wider separation to come. By then, Salvatore and Angelo, along with Salvatores stubborn mother, Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) and his mute other son, Pietro (Filippo Pucillo), have been persuaded to cross the Atlantic by the allure of trick photos of giant chickens and trees that grow money. On board, an attraction strikes up between Salvatore and Lucy (Charlotte Gainsbourg), a lone English-woman, whose reasons for joining the throng remain unclear.Crialese indulges the rituals and privations of migration, blending telling human detail with more impressionistic moments: Pietro bids farewell to a cow; the groan of the ship haunts the journey; and Salvatore dreams one night of floating in milk with Lucy and hanging on to a floating giant carrot, so conflating in a poetic vision two myths relating to life in the New World  that there are lakes of milk and that vegetables are big beyond belief.<br />The final scenes in Ellis Island  involving tests of intelligence and marriages of convenience  are superbly choreographed, and Crialese shows a deft ability to flit between the ensemble and the personal. The experience of the Mancuso family remains central, but the director never loses sight of the experience of an entire generation of his compatriots. His film stands as smart testimony to their journeys.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Agns Varda may be Brussels born and raised, but shes every inch a part of French cinema history: she has been making films in France for over 50 years, almost as long as shes been based in Paris, where she enjoyed early friendships with Alain Resnais and Chris Marker, and was married to Jacques Demy, director of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, from 1962 until his death in 1990. This, she says, is her last film, although, for Varda, filming and photographing are reflex actions, and the border between fact and fiction is blurred, so one imagines and hopes shell at least continue to make art installations and shorts. <br />The Beaches of Agns is a puckish, moving and wonderfully eccentric tour through her life  a tour guided by Varda herself, petite and mushroom-haired, as she visits people and places (more places than people) close to her heart and work. Memories and reconstructions bounce off each other as Varda stages interpretations of her life  such as sailing up the Seine in a small boat to signify her move from Ste to Paris  or recreates situations, such as crafting a theatre set to reflect her long-time Paris house in its original state, and gathering old, aged friends from Ste to fish on the beach. Alongside these autobiographical episodes, which fall between documented performance pieces and filmed installations, we see the odd clip of her or her films, but most of the past is channelled through the present and the strongest sense of nostalgia is reserved for Demy, whom Varda still mourns and for whom she displays unquestioned love.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Billy Ray Cyruss performance in this sporadically amusing if spirit-drainingly formulaic Disney musical recalls the comedian Bill Hickss claim that hes a jar-headed, no-talent cracker asshole. Its true that as an actor, Cyrus is about as expressive as a black sack full of splintered cricket bats. His monumental awfulness, though, is not enough to ruin the movie, and thats all down to the whip-smart comic energy of his daughter, Miley Cyrus, as gangly high-schooler Miley Stewart, who secretly moonlights as mega-selling tween popstrel Hannah Montana. The story, such as it is, sees Miley spirited away from the phoniness of Tinseltown and back to her birthplace in rural Tennessee where shes forced to endure jug-band hoe-downs, the longing gaze of an unfeasibly gorgeous farmhand and grannys hackneyed old-timey witterings. While Cyruss droll performance (Mileys not Billy Rays) deserves better material, this is still amply entertaining.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p><i>Click here to read an interview with Courtney Hunt, the director of 'Frozen River'</i><br />Like some weary, modern day Mildred Pierce, Melissa Leos Ray is the poverty-belt princess who will go any distance to ensure the future of her children  even if it means bending the law. Underfed, underpaid and virtually unemployed (her shifts at the Yankee Dollar discount store are not keeping the family afloat), we join her at a low ebb as her no-good husband has scuttled off to Atlantic City with the final payment for her dream mobile home. Teetering on a financial precipice, Ray becomes embroiled in a people-trafficking scam on a nearby Mohawk reservation which connects to the Canadian border across a stretch of icy water, and her improbable accomplice is a dumpy, softly-spoken Mohawk named Lila (Misty Upham). <br />Occasionally marred by contrivance and a crude internal logic that doesnt bear close scrutiny, Frozen River works best as a knuckle-gnawing, blue-collar genre thriller, with debut director Courtney Hunt doing well to wring every last drop of tension from the pairs foolhardy endeavour. Yet she also makes sure the film doesnt stray into the territory of the hand-wringing, sisters-doing-it-for-themselves parable. Its only in the closing scenes that the awkward central relationship attains a hard-won level of empathy and cross-cultural understanding. Leos beautifully textured and interior (not to mention Oscar-nominated) performance is also praiseworthy, not only as a muzzled depiction of a maternal crisis of confidence, but also as a portrait of a woman breathlessly dealing with the blows that life in recession-swamped America ceaselessly doles out to her.</p><p><i><i>Click here to read an interview with Courtney Hunt, the director of 'Frozen River'</i></i> <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[By now, youll know that Ken Loachs new film stars Eric Cantona as the imaginary mentor of a Manchester postman who suffers panic attacks and cant cope with his two mouthy stepsons. Its a playful but never gimmicky set-up that turns hero worship on its head, as the cool-headed Cantona appears in the life of scruffy Eric Bishop (Steve Evets) to tell him in that familiar sagely mumble to pull himself together and reconnect with his pals. Oh, and Cantona takes him for a jog, shares Bishops spliffs and shows off his own, limited, trumpeting skills.<br />The pair swap tips on how to cope with the dark times and reminisce over Cantonas goals, cueing several stirring montages of balls hitting the back of the net. Eric might tire a little of the Frenchmans gnomic advice (Im still getting over the seagulls one!), but an amusing, touching friendship emerges that slowly nudges a suicidal man back towards the solidarity of the workplace and the terraces  a fading solidarity that the film both celebrates and laments.<br />But there are two, not one, intimate, winning relationships at the heart of this film  one imagined, the other real. Theres the rapport between postie and ex-footballer, and theres the softly-softly reconciliation of Eric Bishop and his ex-wife Lily (Stephanie Bishop), a woman he hasnt seen for 20 years after their youthful marriage turned sour. They meet cautiously, initially for practical reasons as they share the childcare of their granddaughter, but later they begin to inquire into each others lives and try to work out what went wrong many years before. Their scenes together are the films highlights, and both Evets and Bishop  neither of whom have had such demanding acting roles before  give honest and warm performances.<br />The beauty of Loachs film is that both these relationships feel equally relevant to Erics life and Loachs examination of it. The winning power of Looking for Eric lies in this meeting of the magic and the mundane. Its mainly a film about men  men who fail themselves, like Eric, and men who fail society, like the hoodlums we see tempting Erics sons into crime in the films less successful climactic storyline, which involves angry dogs, kidnapping, YouTube and gunplay, and feels a little out of place after the films quiet tte--tte. But then Loach and his writer Paul Laverty are nostalgists for lost causes, and this is their chance to grieve again for the changing world of work. <br />Their last film, Its a Free World, mourned a more moral approach to employment; here they mourn the lack of opportunities for Erics sons. But Looking for Eric is more of a cheerful wake than a funeral. Football might be corporate, Eric might be going gaga, teenage boys might be all adrift, but what win out are humour, love, friendship and the support of your mates. Its a Loach film all right  with added optimism and laughs.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Young, Indian writer-director Avie Luthra delivers a jaundiced, sporadically funny and sharp-mouthed comedy-drama in 'Mad, Sad &amp; Bad'. Bracketed by the funeral of a conventional if dangerously Bacardi-addicted Indian mother (Leena Dhingra), it examines in flashback the lives of her offspring: unmarriable Rashmi (Meera Syal), sex addict psychologist Hardeep (Zubin Varla) and sitcom writer Atul (Nitin Ganatra). The movie shows initial promise, not least in the way Luthras stiff, almost philosophical script attempts to adjust its attitudes towards cultural assimilation and dysfunctional familial relations to reflect those of its conflicted thirtysomething, British-born protagonists. But his touch deserts him elsewhere, and a disconcerting fluctuation in tone  from sorrowful satire to cheesy sitcom  proves the films fatal flaw.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Albert Lewin wasnt your average Hollywood director. A professor and antiquities expert, friend of artists Man Ray and Max Ernst, he wound up at MGM, who funded this flamboyant 1950 fantasy. Exemplifying the true magic of Lewins cinema, its 1930s-set retelling of the Flying Dutchman tale enshrines a vision of desire stronger than death. A brooding, restrained James Mason is the yachtsman who moors at a Costa Brava fishing port, where his destiny is soon entwined with Ava Gardners man-eating playgirl Pandora. A ruby-lipped incarnation of the eternal feminine, she toys with matadors and racing drivers, but in this enigmatic voyager  doomed to wander the seas  she meets a match which could be the making of them both.<br />Lewin brings off the near-impossible task of positing a transcendent love in a sceptical age, succeeding through his own conviction, and indeed because Gardner, in the role of a lifetime, seems as much screen goddess as mere mortal  an apotheosis rendered by cameraman Jack Cardiff in Technicolor so heady its the stuff of legend. Unlike Powell and Pressburger at their peak, however, the storytelling remains earthbound, with a beardy English academic character on hand to explain the references lest 1950s viewers didnt get it. A film ahead of its time? Quite possibly, though you forgive the stodgy pace for the sheer uniqueness with which Lewin conjures a celluloid equivalent of the canvasses of De Chirico and Dal  passionate, classical, mysterious and surreal all at once.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In 1962, the French New Waves most avid bookworm released an adaptation of Henri-Pierre Rochs novel Jules et Jim. It was Franois Truffauts second adaptation (and his third feature film) but this one was special: the young tyro director and the art collector from another era (Roch had died in 1959, aged 80) came together like, well, Jules and Jim. <br />Roches autobiographical story of a Frenchman, Jim (Henri Serre) and a German, Jules (Oskar Werner) whose friendship survives World War I (where they fight on opposite sides, terrified that they will kill one another) and their adoration of the same impossible woman, Catherine (Jeanne Moreau) becomes, in Truffauts hands, a paean to passion and an ineffably elegant flick on the nose to convention.<br /><br />The filmmaking is wildly inventive, but not in a Godardian, clever-clogs manner. Instead, Truffaut and his cinematographer, the great Raoul Coutard, use handheld camera, freeze-frames, newsreel footage and song (Catherines ditty, Le Tourbillon de la Vie [Lifes Whirlwind] became a hit) in the same way the trio of characters use races, bicycle trips or, in Catherines case, unpremeditated jumps into the Seine: to keep life (and cinema), crazy and beautiful at all times. <br />Despite its name, this is Moreaus film: gorgeous, capricious and dauntingly destructive, she makes a fabulous whirlwind. There is great sadness in Jules et Jim, what with the war, Catherines betrayals and the nebulous tragedy that is growing up, for those who can manage it but, after the whirlwind has departed, its the joy  the sense of plunging into life  that remains.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Danny Boyles Slumdog Millionaire is a film so upbeat and colourful that, by the time youre relaying its infectious air of optimism to friends, you could forget that it features orphans, slaughter, organised crime, poverty, enslavement and police brutality in its crowd-pleasing repertoire of suffering and renewal. Hell, it even ends with a get-up-and-dance Bollywood number on the platform of Mumbais Victoria Terminus.Shot entirely in India and largely on location, the fabric of the film is winningly realistic. But the story is pure fantasy inspired partly by co-producer Celadors desire to enshrine its winning creation, the game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire? in a movie. <br />Still, Boyle succeeds in leaving these creepy beginnings behind to create a film thats full of warmth and humanity and forever looks on the bright side of tragedy. The script is a simple conceit: writer Simon Beaufoy (The Full Monty) has ripped up Vikas Swarups novel Q&amp;A and turned it into a rags-to-riches yarn about Jamal (Dev Patel), a young, slum-born adult in Mumbai who gives such a cracking performance on Millionaire, that hes only one question shy of the 20-million-rupee jackpot. Such unlikely success inspires envy on the part of the shows creepy host (Anil Kapoor), who invites the police to arrest, question and torture him. This interrogation offers flashbacks of episodes in Jamals life that reveal the extraordinary sources of his knowledge and lend Boyle the handy framework of a child becoming an adult against all the odds in an India thats changing by the hour but still dangerous for any kid on the loose.<br />Of all Boyles mixed work, from the promise of Shallow Grave to the embarrassment of Millions and the recent experiment of Sunshine, his new film probably best resembles Trainspotting: where in that film he found energy, humour and bonhomie in the stupor of heroin addiction, here he takes the impoverished life of a young Indian and spins it into an escapist fairytale steeped in the sights and sounds of the new India. By the time Jamal gets his girl  ultimately and simplistically its a romance  and everyones tapping their feet, youll have forgotten that one of his young friends was blinded and another sold into prostitution. You may also forgive some of the plots wilder turns and increasingly erratic jumps in time.<br /> Boyle flirts with realism but never fully buys into it. <br />Hes too concerned with keeping the mood light and the pace furious. Hes a flashy filmmaker at times, but the real saving grace of Slumdog Millionaire is how Boyle and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle go to extreme and pleasing lengths to soak up the colours, people and places of India. The films messages  that hard-earned street knowledge can be as valuable as traditional education and, while hardly original, that later success can overcome earlier hardship  are attractive if youre willing to bite your tongue at the air of positivity. With so much good humour about you can even forgive the films bizarre slip from one language to another as young Indian actors give way to a warm, English-language performance from Britains Patel, whos just one of a cast of actors who are as likeable and compelling as the film itself.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[There are some arresting voices in this pleasant but unfocused American documentary which aims to take philosophy off the page and bring it to the screen. But you cant help but feel that director Astra Taylor fails at her own challenge of making an academic subject come truly alive as cinema. Pleasingly, Taylor films her subjects, each of whom delivers a mini essay, outside their homes and offices. So Peter Singer discusses the ethics of buying luxury goods as he ambles down New Yorks Fifth Avenue, while Judith Butler muses on what it means to walk with her wheelchair-bound friend Sunaura Taylor as they pound the streets of San Francisco together. Slovenian philosopher/personality Slavoj Zizek provides the films highlight by explaining why he thinks the green movement is a load of tosh. We may be turning ecology into the new opium of the masses, he says, before imploring us to love the whopping great pile of trash sitting behind him.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[We may have moved from veiled Cold War to explicit global terror in the 25 years since the excellent, UK-set nuclear conspiracy thriller Edge of Darkness first aired on the BBC, directed by Martin Campbell (Casino Royale) and written by Troy Kennedy Martin. Its also been some eight, traumatic post-9/11 years since Mel Gibsons last thespian outing in M Night Shyamalans Signs. But time seems to have stood still in Campbells drab remake for the big screen. With its nuclear concerns and old-fashioned heroics, it feels like a period piece.<br />In condensing the original mini-series into a conventional, two-hour package, scriptwriters William Monahan and Andrew Bovell have sadly sacrificed some of the originals cultural specificity and its slow-burn quality. Moreover, in relocating from northern England to the USs Eastern Seaboard, they have jettisoned much of the chilling atmospherics. Craven, the widowed police officer whose engineer daughter (Bojana Novakovic) is gunned down on a home visit, is now one of Boston PDs finest; and if its true that Gibson, in the role, recalls the earnest intensity and investigative zeal of Bob Pecks original performance, he also brings a lot of unwanted Lethal Weapon-era manic mannerisms to the part.<br /><br />Its basically a little guy against the system movie, literally so in many of Campbells framings  for instance, where he miniaturises Gibsons now slightly wizened figure against the looming bulk of Danny Hustons smarmy corporate bad guy. However, Ray Winstone, as a boozy high-level fixer in pointed contrast to Cravens ginger-ale-drinking sobriety, does offer good value in what is otherwise a surprisingly low-wattage and anonymously directed thriller. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[From the director of "Gladiator"! scream the posters, and youd be forgiven for expecting a straight rerun of that Oscar-winning hit - a film that swaps togas and short swords for Lincoln green and feathered arrows. But this Robin Hood is a more unpredictable beast: while the shakycam action sequences, effete young villain and moody presence of Russell Crowe hark back to the earlier film, this is far closer to Scotts ambitious but unloved Kingdom of Heaven in its depiction of a world ruled by brute force and striving for moral direction.<br />The opening act could even work as a sequel to that film: fighting his way back from the Crusades in the army of Richard the Lionheart, archer Robin Longstride decides to head for home when the King gets an arrow in the neck. By a series of unbelievable coincidences, Robin finds himself posing as deceased nobleman Robert Locksley, charged with taking news of the Lionhearts death back to his troublesome brother, the new King John (Oscar Isaac).<br />This kickstarts the long series of subterfuges, political dirty deals and full-scale treachery that constitute the films wildly convoluted story. It's plots aplenty: King John plots against his former Chancellor, Marshall (a stately William Hurt); traitor Godfrey (Mark Strong) plots against John, Robin and the entire English nation in concert with the devious King Philip of France; while Maid Marian (Cate Blanchett) and her ailing father-in-law (Max von Sydow) plot to keep Robin in Nottingham in the guise of the former Lord Locksley.<br />Confused? You will be. Anyone expecting a straightforward woodland beat-em-up will be bemused and most likely dismayed by the intricacies of the narrative, particularly when it becomes clear that Scott has been forced to trim back the action to fit in all these dastardly goings-on. Add a complete absence of characterisation, some laughable accents (Crowe sounds like hes auditioning for Coronation Street) and a sense of history that would make Simon Schama scream, and youve got the makings of what should be a tedious, overblown disaster.<br />But for all his faults, Scott knows what hes doing. The film looks terrific: the English landscape hasnt looked so lush and magical for a long time, particularly in a clutch of gorgeous moonlit night scenes. Aesthetically it's convincing, which goes a long way towards offsetting the more nutty convolutions in the plot. And while characterisation has been cut to the bone, Crowe, Blanchett, Strong and especially Von Sydow remain eminently watchable, with strong, likeable support from the likes of Mark Addy as Friar Tuck and Matthew MacFadyen as a marvellously greasy Sheriff of Nottingham.<br />Best of all, the film just feels huge: genuinely epic in a way few movies have since Lord of the Rings. The endless plot twists may be perplexing, but they work to make the movie feel eventful and involving: after 140 minutes, audiences will feel like theyve been somewhere, lived through something. And so, while this Robin Hood is a long way from perfect, it remains a satisfyingly immense and old fashioned grand-canvas experience.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Bollywoods latest attempt to expand their horizons is an accessible watch for viewers new to the genre. Its not three hours long for starters! The beautiful leads do not break into songs! J (Roshan), an American NRI (Non Resident Indian) shyster living in Las Vegas, falls for Linda (Mori), the Mexican fiance of his girlfriends brother Tony (Brown). He speaks Hinglish; she knows only Espanol. As love and music have no language our linguistically-challenged duo bond and elope. Tony vows bloody revenge. Basu reworks diverse sources like Bonnie and Clyde, Thelma and Louise, Sin City and the 80s Hindi classic Ek Duuje Ke Liye to (unintentional) amusing effect into his propulsive plot. The technically accomplished result is cheesy, engaging but unmemorable time-pass. Look out for Brett Ratners shorter remix version.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Sex and the City was the kind of show that actually improved over timeand not just for us straight guys tuning in for girlie gossip. What started off as Cosmo-lubricated escapism (especially in Candace Bushnells original design) slowly began to gain heft, as the real subject came into view: mortality. Men would never fully complete these women, nor would sex, though the shows fuck-me feminism was certainly welcome. When brassy Samantha (Cattrall), the seriess finest creation, quietly broke down at a funeral, we were suddenly watching real drama.<br />Youll hear much sniffling in your dolled-up audience as this mega-anticipated film version unspools. Thats actually a good thing: Sex and the City, written and directed by the shows most intelligent helmer, Michael Patrick King, is a proper evolution, gradually empowered, honest and loaded with candy-colored anxiety. Yes, Big (Chris Noth) and Carrie (Parker) plan a gorgeous wedding, complete with a Vogue photo shoot. Not everything goes to plan, and for the next two hours, the movie is a mourning story, a resiliency tale. Tears are shed in a Mexican retreat. Hair is dyed dark. Its serious-period Woody Allen, if he were a better shopper.<br />Carrie hires an intuitive assistant (Jennifer Hudson, better than in her overrated Dreamgirls turn) to help her go through the wreckage of her life, and the film leans into some rebirth clichseven literally, when Charlotte (Davis) suddenly turns up preggers. But here too is cheating, jealousy and smugness. More subtly, can you think of the last time a Hollywood movie starred four cougars? (Hollywood needs SATC more than HBO does.) Of course, theres room for multiple resolutions that accommodate forgivenessand truthfulness. In a sense, thats the happiest ending of all for a show that required its wrinkles more than it knew.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its the end of the world as we know it and Werner Herzog is asking Antarcticas leading expert whether penguins ever go insane. Whatever Americas National Science Foundation was expecting when it commissioned the maverick German to come back from the South Pole with a feature-length doc, the result is neither fluffy wildlife showcase nor flat-out eco tub-thumping, but a characteristic amalgam of quirky observation and profound musing. <br />Bathed in 24-hour daylight for its summer months, the McMurdo Research Station proves a magnet for professional dreamers and eccentrics, among them a fitter who believes the shape of his hand affirms his royal Aztec heritage and a much-travelled biologist whose party piece involves her being zipped up inside a piece of luggage. All a bit of a hoot, though it goes without saying theres a bigger picture here. <br />We are the witness through which the universe becomes conscious of its own magnificence, reflects a passing philosopher, quoting Alan Watts. It sounds airy-fairy in print, but makes compelling sense as images unfurl of the vast tundra, an iceberg bigger than Northern Ireland and, most staggeringly, an aquatic world beneath the ice floes populated by wiggly creatures looking like escapees from a sci-fi flick. Herzog doesnt bombard us with facts about global warming, but the evidence is so clear that theres a doomsday feeling about all of this wonder, a feeling as powerful, haunting and humbling as the Bulgarian choral music the film reserves for its most eye-boggling moments. Seemingly off-hand, cumulatively imposing, utterly masterful.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Admirers of David Peaces novel will notice a friendlier approach to Brian Clough in this version. Written by Peter Morgan, it stars his muse Michael Sheen as the gobby manager who triumphed at Derby County before failing to fill the shoes of new England boss Don Revie in charge of Division One flash boys Leeds United in 1974. Gone are the paranoid, booze-drenched first-person screeches of Peace to be replaced with a simplified and kinder twin focus on Cloughs reliance on his assistant Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall) and his manic obsession with Revie (Colm Meaney).There are hints of Frost/Nixon: Clough calls Revie in the night, while their rivalry culminates in a televisual face-off. Peace/Morgan is an equivalent showdown: how can Morgan, a writer who injects fiction into reality, improve on Peace, whose daring extends to imagining 1970s Yorkshire as a noir hell in his Red Riding books? In simplifying Peace, Morgan clips his own wings.<br />Director Tom Hooper, known for small-screen triumphs like Longford, must squeeze from scant resources a sense of both the epic  ie the football  and the period, which, with its tatty stadiums, was decidely non-epic. Hes better at the latter, although a witty script helps plug the gaps. At best, Hooper follows a match entirely from the perspective of the dressing room. At worst, he has to make archive footage work so hard it upstages his drama. Hes blessed with character turns: Sheen is cheeky and likeable, while Jim Broadbents Derby chairman is deliciously old-school. The biggest failure is the films portrayal of the Leeds team: the oddly-coiffured lads are never more than a unit and the calamity of Cloughs time in charge too much of a given.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Known primarily for his bookish studies of family discord, 67-year-old French director Andr Tchin (The Witnesses, Strayed) has said that The Girl on the Train is his action movie. But dont expect a hysterical riposte to Transformers 2. Beyond numerous shots of the films star Emilie Dequenne (Rosetta, pictured right) gliding around on rollerblades and a scene involving a knife attack in a warehouse, Tchin fans can rest easy. Instead, the film uses these nuggets of action to tell a satisfying and illusive tale about the psychological knock-ons of trauma, the medias readiness to exploit controversy and how its easier to tell a lie than maintain it. Dequenne is superb as Jeanne, a free spirit who unwisely reacts to a tragedy by inventing a situation which suggests she is the victim of a violent race-hate attack. Tchin regulars Catherine Deneuve and Michel Blanc offer strong support as Jeannes mother and boss, but the films big strength is its unwillingness to dish out easy answers.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Too often during artist Shirin Neshats first film for cinema  co-directed by fellow artist Shoja Azari, also born in Iran and resident in America  I felt I was looking at and admiring it rather than engaging with it on the level of emotions or ideas. Neshat draws on Shahrnush Parsipurs novel of the same name to tell the experience of four women  prostitute Zarin (Orsi Toth), middle-aged bourgeoise Fakhri (Arita Shahrzad), single 30 year old Munis (Shabnam Tolouei, pictured) and her friend Faezeh (Pegah Ferydoni)  during the 1953, CIA-backed coup which overthrew the democratic government and returned the Shah to power. Its a beautiful package, not least because of astounding photography by Martin Gschlecht (Lourdes), but it feels like a triumph of art direction and lighting over its attempt to reflect the experience of Iranian women during the time its set and, by implication, today. The mixture of realism and poetry, the literary and the visual, is awkward and the only character whose experience resonates is Zarin, mainly because of Toths possessed performance.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The subtitle  Aerial Perspectives on the Alberta Tar Sands  only tells you some of what you need to know about this flyover view of the worlds second largest oil reserve in the throes of rapid exploitation  a process that each day releases levels of carbon dioxide equal to all the cars in Canada. Limiting context to a few titles at the beginning and a voiceover at the end, filmmaker Peter Mettler (cinematographer on 2006s Manufactured Landscapes) gives us staggering images of this remote region of Canada from the air: his style suggests a spy plane hijacked by a visual artist moonlighting as an eco-warrior. Slo-mo photography gives the film a ghostly feel, while Mettlers lingering on the details offers an otherwordly view of landscape and industry as oily sand starts to look like marble and vile brown waste even echoes chocolate. Were getting used to seeing eco-docs on our screens (the more prosaic Dirty Oil tackled the same subject back in March), but this hallucinatory, 43-minute film is more of a protesting art piece than a docu-essay.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[With its radical rewriting of a genre in which good had always triumphed over evil, Romero's first feature shattered the conventions of horror and paved the way for the subversive visions of directors like David Cronenberg, Tobe Hooper and Sam Raimi. The film's opening scene immediately signals its own subversiveness. In broad daylight, a brother and sister visit their father's grave; seeing a tall man lumbering towards them, Johnny tries to frighten Barbara with a daft Boris Karloff impersonation; suddenly the figure lurches forward and kills him. With the presumed hero dead within the first few minutes, the inexorable logic of the modern 'nightmare movie' is set in motion, and from this moment on the terror never lets up. Together with a small group of fellow survivors, Barbara holes up in a nearby farmhouse, besieged by an ever-swelling tide of flesh-eating zombies. Trapped inside the house, they fight for their lives, but nothing works out as it should; whenever it seems there might be a glimmer of hope, Romero cruelly reverses our expectations. The nihilistic ending, in particular, has to be seen to be believed. Chuckle, if you can, during the first few minutes; because after that laughter catches in the throat as the clammy hand of terror tightens its grip.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
Joel (Carrey) is a shy sort of fellow who might prefer a huddle with his pens and drawing pads to the jolts and vagaries of novel human interaction. Waiting for the overland to work one wintry day, he feels an uncontrollable urge to hop a train in the opposite direction, and only thus encounters Clementine (Winslet), a blue-dyed boho who makes little distinction between her every thought and the words she speaks. His passivity attracts and antagonises her; she flummoxes him and turns him on. Counter-intuitively, they click. It's almost as if they've met before. Viewers deserve to see Gondry and screenwriter Kaufman's hilarious, love-stricken, endlessly inventive collaboration fresh for themselves - especially since the more surreal thrills hinge on an 'am I awake or dreaming' mix up, and since even the quieter passages tremble with pain and revelatory vulnerability. We won't go into too much detail about Dr Mierzwiak (Wilkinson), who runs a popular if low rent New York practice in memory-modification with a merry young staff (including Dunst, Ruffalo and Wood); or into how the film, in boldly dramatising memory and the subconscious, develops as an equally loopy and poignant companion piece to Kaufman's <i>Being John Malkovich</i>. Suffice to say the formidable Gondry/ Kaufman/Carrey axis works marvel after marvel in expressing the bewildering beauty and existential horror of being trapped inside one's own addled mind, and in allegorising the self-preserving amnesia of a broken but hopeful heart.

      <review><![CDATA[Part romance, part comedy, part meditation on matters political and philosophical, Wenders' remarkable movie posits a world haunted by invisible angels listening in to our thoughts. Such plot as there is concerns two kindly spirits (Ganz and Sander), posted to contemporary Berlin, who encounter a myriad of mortals, including an ageing writer blighted by memories of a devastated Germany; actor Peter Falk, on location shooting a film about the Nazi era; and a lonely trapeze artist, with whom Ganz falls in love, thus prompting his desire to become mortal at last. A film about the Fall and the Wall, it's full of astonishingly hypnotic images (courtesy veteran Henri Alkan), and manages effortlessly to turn Wenders' and Peter Handke's poetic, literary script into pure cinematic expression. Masterpiece? Maybe not, but few films are so rich, so intriguing, or so ambitious.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Like <i>Les Anges du Pch</i>, Bresson's second feature, based on a self-contained anecdote in Diderot's novel <i>Jacques le Fataliste</i>, is in many ways atypical of his oeuvre. He uses, quite brilliantly, professional actors. The visual texture is not muted grey, but sharp and contrasty. The camera is constantly prowling and tracking. The dialogue (by Cocteau) is brilliantly jewelled, literary to the point of preciousness, the very antithesis of the later monosyllabics. Yet as one watches the elegant socialite (played by Casars with superbly steely venom) spin a cold-blooded plot to destroy her rival after being humiliatingly spurned in a liaison in the interests of true love, one could hardly be anywhere but in Bresson's world. Sexuality takes precedence over salvation, but there is the same interiority, the same intensity, the same rigorous exclusion of all inessentials.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Despite the rather over-the-top moralising of the finale, which posits a dramatic comeuppance for Tracy, the ambitious and cynical showman who has built himself into a wealthy carnival- and ship-owner by exploiting and manipulating people, this is still a very enjoyable film. Partly for its bizarre, pre-<i>Nightmare Alley</i> Gothic vision of circus life, partly for Tracy's admirably tough performance, and partly for the spectacular insertion of the famous 'hell' sequence (later re-used in Ken Russell's <i>Altered States</i>). The allegory may be banal, the vision pure kitsch, but it's hard to deny the sheer fun of seeing so many scantily-clad extras cavorting wildly amid such architecturally extravagant sets.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Despite numerous droll diversions, this is the most nakedly nostalgic of Varda's loving backtracks over the life and career of her husband Jacques Demy. It comprises material shot by Varda in 1966 during the making of Les Demoiselles de Rochefort intercut with footage of the city's festivities 25 years later (attended by Deneuve, Legrand, and others), plus, of course, copious extracts from the movie and lots of interviews. Foremost among the latter is a bunch of 30-something Rochefortiens with magical childhood memories of dancing a couple of steps with Gene Kelly, being smiled at by Catherine Deneuve. They soften the contrast between a sundrenched, exuberant Then and a subdued, rainswept Now, with its melancholy roster of absentees: Kelly, Dorlac, Cloquet, Demy himself.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Adaptation of a stage play (<i>This Story of Yours</i>) by John Hopkins (of <i>Z Cars</i>). Discreet as it is, the opening-out process (effected by Hopkins himself) has sabotaged the strange, claustrophobic duel in which a suspected child-molester (Bannen) and the cop obsessively convinced of his guilt (Connery) find themselves subtly changing places during the course of interrogation. Embedded in a 'realistic' police scene, dialogue and situations now have a ring of arty melodrama. Fascinating, nevertheless, with outstanding performances from Connery and (especially) Bannen.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Varda's film about the changing but deep friendship between two women from 1962 to 1976 is also the story of the transformation of their attitudes towards being women in a patriarchal culture. But two distinct elements - a stylistic approach and a sense of nostalgia - make this a very different kind of feminist film, in which reality, though present, never leaves any real scars on an essentially romantic fable. The film's ambience remains that of the '60s dream rather than the harsh reality of the '70s; but as such, it at least provides a considered escapist identification that mainstream cinema has traditionally denied women in its male-dominated fantasies.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Pay attention, none of this makes much sense. Five years after the murder of his son, FBI agent Sean Archer (Travolta) finally has the drop on terrorist Castor Troy (Cage) - but with Castor comatose and a bomb ticking somewhere in LA, Archer's persuaded to undergo facial surgery, swapping Castor's features for his own. In this way, Archer-as-Troy (Cage) hopes to trick the location out of Castor's brother Pollux (Nivola). Unfortunately, Castor wakes up, and makes off with Archer's face, killing everyone who's in on the secret, and moving into his enemy's office. Woo's poetic-kinetic style has evolved, if not to the point of abstraction, then to delirium: he makes a virtue of incredulity. With two of Hollywood's most flamboyant actors playing each other, the movie becomes a kind of pop <i>Heat</i>, an elaborate self-parody and quasi-serious examination of the art of film acting. Yet there's an authentic subversive frisson as Travolta (as-Troy-as-Archer) sizes up his rebellious teenage daughter, puts the sizzle back into a stale marriage, and generally carries on with the air of a sociopath getting the most out of life. 'Are we having any fun yet?' he demands. Twice over.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Like RW Fassbinder before him, Haynes reworks Sirk's <i>All That Heaven Allows</i> to masterly effect. Unlike <i>Fear Eats the Soul</i>, however, <i>Far from Heaven</i> retains the post-war suburban New England setting - Hartford, Connecticut, 1957 - a time and place of deceptively tranquil well being, prior to the liberating turmoil of the '60s. Cathy and Frank Whitaker (Moore and Quaid) appear to have it all. He's a TV sales exec, she's a happy wife and mother with fine friends and a wonderful maid. Then she finds Frank leads a double life. And because their circle has no truck even with guilt ridden homosexuals, she's so isolated that her most comforting moments are conversations with their gardener - trouble is, Raymond (Haysbert) is black. While Haynes' script has its moments of humour, it wisely steers clear of condescension and camp while exploring a maze of taboos, confusions, prejudices and double standards. Elmer Bernstein's music, Sandy Powell's costumes and Ed Lachman's camera hit all the right notes, but Haynes' immaculate confection is finally best served by the extraordinary acting. Exultant in both its artifice and its cruel honesty, it's a movie Sirk would make today - and, as such, it's quite brilliant.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Beginning in light-hearted mood with four women deceiving their husbands to go drinking at a spa, this exquisite Ozu film gradually turns dark as it charts the marital crisis of one of the women and her taciturn husband. At once a study of the shortcomings and strengths of the arranged marriage, and an exploration of what constitutes deceit, and an understated celebration of love tentatively rekindled (one might almost call it Ozu's <i>Viaggio in Italia</i>), this is also one of the director's most 'active' films; the camera frequently moves, there are car rides, train journeys and planes taking off, as well as scenes at baseball games and cycle races. Very funny and very moving.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Renoir's return to film-making in France after an absence of fifteen years is a nostalgic studio reconstruction of the Paris of his painter father. Despite its artificiality and meandering plot construction - with Renoir falling in love with some of his minor characters - it brilliantly evokes the world of the French Impressionists, building into a comic riot of colour and movement. The story is a backstage musical on the founding of the Moulin Rouge and the training of the famous cancan dancers. The climactic cancan scene is one of the finest dance sequences ever filmed, and worth the price of a ticket on its own.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ogier and Karyo are an ill-matched couple; she longs for freedom, love and excitement, and moves out into her own Parisian pied--terre in order to see him only at weekends. But rumours, misunderstandings and flirtations hold sway with such vengeance that Ogier's double life backfires. It's as elegant and incisive a comedy of manners as ever from Rohmer, deriving much wit and subtlety from the simplest of plots, merely by concentrating on conversations and the mixed-up motives that fuel them. But accusations that the film is too literary or verbal miss the point entirely: performance, decor and composition - not to mention narrative structure - are all at the service of the film's meaning, perhaps most notably in a marvellous party scene where the body language of dancing and glances speaks volumes.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Keitel is the depraved and corrupt New York cop of the title. Hooked on crack, heroin and alcohol, he's up to his eyeballs in debt and staking his life on the Dodgers - and they're starting to lose. Perversely, the appalling rape of a nun proffers salvation: a $50,000 reward to find the perpetrator. The film isn't so much a thriller as a slice of (low-) life. The script is cut to the bone, the set-ups have a <i>vrit </i>feel, while the editing mimics real time in long, nearly unwatchable sequences in which Keitel shoots up, or masturbates before two teenage girls. Ferrara allows his star to dictate the pace, and is rewarded with a performance of extraordinary, terrifying honesty. This is an actor laying himself bare before the camera/confessor. Astonishingly, Ferrara ups the ante. Out of degradation, he pulls redemption. It is a jarring stroke, and will divide audiences who have stayed with the film this far. It seems to me that Ferrara is an artist of the profane; his Catholicism looks suspiciously like a Scorsese hand-me-down. In this exploitation/art movie, it may just be that the truth is in the sleaze.]]></review>

Not as incisive as Minnelli's film, but still a heady Mankiewicz brew of Hollywood trash and wit. Also something of a <i>film  clef</i>, in which the millionaire producer is Howard Hughes, there are disguised caricatures (Farouk, the Duke of Windsor), and the Contessa herself is a tactful mixture (mostly Rita Hayworth).]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Before Terry Gilliam had a go at the epic travels of fabled liar Munchhausen, Zeman had a stab in this live-action version shot in tinted b/w with occasional colour inserts. It uses collage and animation techniques that wouldn't look out of place in the work of Mlis (or Gilliam's own Python days, for that matter). Watch the Baron, moon-man and chums gruesomely outnumbered by the Turkish fleet, save the day by creating a smokescreen of the Turks' own pipe tobacco. Curious and fun.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[What more can be said about <i>Potemkin </i>- the celebrated re-creation, in documentary style, of the key events of the failed 1905 Kronstadt revolution against Tsarist oppression - re-issued (in 1998) in a new print, with music by Shostakovich replacing Meisel's original score. It exemplifies, we know, Eisenstein's facination with 'montage' (the use of dialectical forms of editing to create meaning) and 'typage' (non-actors cast for physical characteristics). This, however, is propaganda, just as much as art, and looking back after more than 70 years there's something cold, academic, even manipulative about the meticulous compositions, schematic characterisations and complex choreography of massed movement. It lacks the genuinely fiery passion of Eisenstein's earlier <i>Strike</i>,<i> </i>not to mention the lyricism of Dovzhenko or the perky wit of Vertov. Edward Tiss's camerawork remains impressive, and there's no doubt that the whole is a technical tour de force, but the obsession with forces of power, as opposed to individual experience, is ultimately oppressive.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
As often with Antonioni, a film riddled with moments of brilliance and scuppered by infuriating pretensions; full of longueurs, it works neither as a portrait of Swinging London, nor as a <i>bona fide</i> thriller. But as it establishes its metaphysical mystery - Hemmings' vacuously trendy photographer discovers a purpose to his life when he enlarges a picture that may or may not prove that a murder has taken place - it does become strangely gripping, questioning the maxim that the camera never lies, and settling into a virtually abstract examination of subjectivity and perception. Deep stuff, then, though the surrounding dross - sex'n'fashion'n'rock'n'roll - makes it pretty hard to watch. Still, at least Carlo Di Palma's camerawork leavens the brew.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The sheer visual elegance and romantic splendour of Varda's film aroused the kind of critical suspicions that quite rightly surround <i>Un Homme et une Femme</i>. But although the sexual politics of its plot (about a man trying to love two women) may seem stilted, the film retains two huge advantages. In the first place, Varda is trying to explore on film the kind of romantic areas that have so often (and so wrongly) been the exclusive province of male directors. And in the second, the overwhelming beauty of the movie's surface is not so much used to glamorise its characters as to illuminate their own dream worlds.]]></review>

Digital technology brings the tiny folk of Mary Norton's children's books to life as never before. Scampering round the kitchen, Arietty Borrower (Newbigin) is almost locked in the freezer when the lure of ice-cream proves too strong. Mum and dad (Imrie and Broadbent, a terrific team) administer a scolding, but this little fracas is as nothing compared to the upheaval that's to follow. The Lenders' great aunt, owner of the house, has died, and since lawyer Ocious Potter (Goodman) can find no will, he's announced his intention to demolish the place. Exemplary entertainment.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Undoubtedly one of the most exciting and inspired horror movies ever made. The story is a classic sampling of expressionist paranoia about a hypnotist who uses a somnambulist to do his murders, full of the gloom and fear that prevailed in Germany as it emerged from WWI. There are plenty of extremely boring sociological/critical accounts of the film; best to avoid them and enjoy the film's extraordinary use of painted light and Veidt's marvellous performance. Incidentally, the influence of <i>Caligari</i> on the cinema is much more problematic than some historians suppose. Thematically it has rarely been copied, and the style only really infiltrated in dream sequences and other odd devices.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The source book of Orson Welles, and still a marvellous movie. Thematically less resonant than some of Welles' later meditations on the nature of power, perhaps, but still absolutely riveting as an investigation of a citizen - newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst by any other name - under suspicion of having soured the American Dream. Its imagery (not forgetting the oppressive ceilings) as Welles delightedly explores his mastery of a new vocabulary, still amazes and delights, from the opening shot of the forbidding gates of Xanadu to the last glimpse of the vanishing Rosebud (tarnished, maybe, but still a potent symbol). A film that gets better with each renewed acquaintance.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Where Haneke's earlier <i>71 Fragments</i>... traced a web of seemingly unconnected events leading up to a catastrophe, this takes the reverse tack of following the destinies of diverse characters witness to one seemingly inconsequential action - a disaffected youth tossing a paper wrapper into the lap of a Romanian woman begging on the Boulevard St Germain. It's a rewarding strategy, delving into the lives of an actress, her war-photographer lover, his brother and father, an African music teacher and his family, and the beggar and her compatriots, to produce a multi-perspective portrait of Western Europe as a society predicated on lies, inequality and communication breakdown. Nothing hugely original in that conclusion, perhaps, but the method is both lucid and dramatically compelling. Scenes here like Binoche being terrorised on the Mtro while other passengers pretend not to notice are spinechillingly authentic. Moreover, despite the film's Bressonian rigours, its emotional force should finally give the lie to Haneke's reputation as a coldly academic film-maker.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Murphy plays HRH Akeem, Crown Prince of Zamunda, whose pampered existence extends to molly-coddled privates. But when presented by his father (Jones) with the <i>fait accompli</i> of a decreed marriage, Akeem rebels and sets off for New York with his loyal manservant (Hall), where he decides that Queens is the most likely whereabouts of the woman who will love him for himself. Lodging in a run-down tenement, the pair find work as cleaners in a hamburger joint, where Akeem soon encounters elegant, sophisticated Lisa (Headley). Much of the credit for this slick, at times very funny movie must go to Landis, since Murphy's previously wasted talent is here harnessed to reveal a considerable finesse; superb comic timing, a satirical edge, and Murphy's extraordinary gift for mimicry lift it right out of the trough of mediocrity to which it is all but consigned by its utterly predictable storyline.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Rohmer's cinema is unmistakable, dedicated as it is to the art of conversation and the rules of attraction. Still, it's a pleasant surprise to see your quintessential Rohmerian nubile young heroine upstaged here by two formidable women 'of a certain age'. Magali (Romand) is a lonely wine maker whose two best friends are Isabelle (Rivire) and her son's girlfriend Rosine (Portal). The latter wants to fix Megali up with her professor (her own blatantly unsuited ex), while Isabelle secretly places a lonely hearts ad, then auditions the likeliest candidate while masquerading as her friend. It's a leisurely comedy, to be sure, but immensely charming. One to savour.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Inaugurating a new Rohmer series (<i>Tales of the Four Seasons</i>), this begins with an atypically wordless sequence which effectively introduces the mood of mystery and ambiguity that will recur throughout. Caught between apartments, philosophy graduate Jeanne (Teyssdre) attends a party, where a young girl, Natasha (Darel), invites her to stay at the flat she shares with her father Igor (Quester). So far so innocent, but presently Jeanne finds herself witness to, then participating in, recriminatory scenes between daughter, father and his youthful lover Eve (Bennett): jealous Natasha detests Eve, accusing her of theft, while Igor - encouraged by Natasha? - seems more than willing to be left alone with Jeanne. As ever, Rohmer examines their hidden motives and analyses the consequences of their actions with great lucidity, repeatedly delving beneath words to uncover, through gesture and intonation, their real meaning; nobody is wholly innocent, no one completely blameless, in the web of intrigue spun between Jeanne and her hosts. Rohmer may not be breaking new ground, but who else could explore his familiar territory so fruitfully?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The third, sunniest and funniest  of Rohmers seasonal tales. Rohmer is without  equal as the writer-director of movies set during holidays: his first feature The Sign of Leo was a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of opting for an idle life in a Paris depopulated for the summer, and the time-off motif has turned up in nine or ten of his subsequent movies. Holidays clearly appeal to Rohmer for  several reasons. They allow extra time and opportunities for talk, for encounters with strangers, for relaxation and escape from restrictive habit or responsibility; for romance, rumination and reversals of fortune; for dilemmas and indecision. Here, a moody young student (Melvil Poupaud) holidaying alone in Brittany is torn between three beauties (Aurlia Nolin, Amanda Langlet and Gwenalle Simon). As this wonderfully witty comedy proceeds from scenes of such apparent inconsequentiality that they feel like documentary to plotting as suspenseful and manipulative as classical farce, Rohmer provides insights aplenty into matters of love, friendship, fidelity, loneliness, luck, destiny and desire. If it all appears artless, look again at the amazingly lengthy travelling shots along the beach and over the clifftops as the characters walk, pouring out feelings and thoughts; at the subtle play of time, place and music; or at the final acts editing, as precise, sharp and tight as a man-trap. Truly great art seldom feels a need to draw attention to itself.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Summer in Brittany: tearfully parting after an idyllic holiday romance with Charles (Van Den Driessche), hairdresser Flicie accidentally gives him an incorrect home address. Four years on, it's Christmas and he still hasn't contacted her; but such is her undying love for him - and the daughter he sired - that she finds it impossible to choose between two adoring suitors: her stolid boss Maxence (Voletti) and intellectual librarian Loc (Furic). Reluctant to compromise her memories and dreams of true passion, she is hoping against hope for a miracle. In focusing on an often irritatingly indecisive heroine devoted to a barely reasonable romantic ideal, the second of Rohmer's 'Tales of the Four Seasons' is reminiscent of <i>The Green Ray</i>, while its wintry study of the varieties of love, faith and religious belief recalls the similarly sublime <i>My Night with Maud</i>. This is Rohmer at his very best, effortlessly and unsentimentally charting the absurd complexities of human psychology, while creating a compelling contemporary fairytale firmly rooted in the banality of everyday existence. It has, as ever, enormous compassion, wit and insight, and its ending is exquisitely affecting.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[First part of Wajda's trilogy, completed by <i>Kanal</i> and <i>Ashes and Diamonds</i>. Those were exciting times for Polish cinema: 'In Poland art fulfils a special function...it carries a certain burden of tradition through the fact that for a hundred years the state did not exist, or it existed only in literature, in art, to which everyone could refer'. Cinema, sometimes laboriously, had to carry the Polish identity. In the '50s, Wajda processed great public events (later too, perforce through analogy), and the trilogy covers the Resistance in Warsaw. <i>A Generation</i>, set in occupied Warsaw in 1942 and revolving around the setting up of a youth resistance group, was his first feature, and hews to the Socialist Realist line. Courage, honour and self-sacrifice inform the actions of his hero, who discovers a sense of purpose in unity, the collective and the Party. Hope opens the trilogy, disillusionment closes it, and the final part centres on an individual crisis and a great star performance fit to rank beside James Dean from Zbigniew Cybulski, here featured in a supporting part. One from the heart.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The French title of this delightful, encouraging documentary underlines how Agns Varda identifies with her subjects - social marginals who 'glean' a living, from the earth (caravan dwellers) or from refuse (the teacher of Malian and Senegalese immigrants whom she befriends at a Paris street market). The veteran film-maker is newly inspired and energised by the freedom her DV camera brings. The film is marked by youthful freshness, and the integrity and sympathy of both the images and the commentary, as Varda hurtles us to Arras, Beaune or Paris in search of the new generation of foragers. Cheekily, she places a frocked lawyer in a crop field, so he can declaim on section 12.26.10 of the penal code enshrining the historic right to take harvest leftovers; persuades an art gallery to disinter a painting of <i>glaneurs</i> from its vaults; takes tips from a young Michelin chef who gleans herbs for his restaurant; or marvels at the totem towers of a nonagenarian Russian '<i>poubelle</i>' artist. It's as if, in following the line of her inspiration, Varda has re-mapped France, her demography of 'marginalia' uniting a diverse community of individuals who're unearthed and celebrated with an intimacy and discretion that is essentially political.]]></review>

Unfortunately, a family of incompetent thieves are also after the loot, and are not above shoving the hand of one of the little mites into a liquidiser to extort information. And while the pre-pubescents continually scream, their doting parents prove equally odious in a finale of astounding sentimentality.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Rohmer, in the third of his 'Comedies and Proverbs', may still be tiptoeing delightfully through the same verbose ground that he's covered for years, but no other director so clearly reveals the distances between words and meaning, thought and action. Here his 15-year-old heroine (Langlet) goes on holiday, and instead of fun finds a perverse, sometimes painful lesson in the emotional games of the adult world: as her older cousin (Dombasle) rejects a boring old flame and lurches into an affair with a sly advocate of freedom in relationships, she witnesses the trio's discussions, double standards, and deceit. Dispensing with heavy plotting as he coolly observes and dissects well-meaning but frequently cruel human interaction, Rohmer yet again proves his ability to merge poignancy and humour by means of delicately nuanced performances and naturalistic but pointed dialogue.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Roeg's debut as a director is a virtuoso juggling act which manipulates its visual and verbal imagery so cunningly that the borderline between reality and fantasy is gradually eliminated. The first half-hour is straight thriller enough to suggest a Kray Bros documentary as Fox, enforcer for a London protection racket, goes about his work with such relish that he involves the gang in a murder and has to hide from retribution in a Notting Hill basement. There, waiting to escape abroad, he becomes involved with a fading pop star (Jagger) brooding in exile over the loss of his powers of incantation. In what might be described (to borrow from Kenneth Anger) as an invocation to his demon brother, the pop star recognises his lost power lurking in the blind impulse to violence of his visitor, and so teases and torments him with drug-induced psychedelics that the latter responds in the only way he knows how: by rewarding one mind-blowing with another, at gunpoint. Ideas in profusion here about power and persuasion and performance ('The only performance that makes it, that makes it all the way, is one that achieves madness'); and the latter half becomes one of Roeg's most complex visual kaleidoscopes as pop star and enforcer coalesce in a marriage of heaven and hell (or underworld and underground) where the common denominator is Big Business.]]></review>

Hatfield - cool, beautiful, and effortlessly suggesting the corruptibility of Dorian's dark soul - is excellent, though even he is overshadowed by the cynical, epigrammatic brilliance of Sanders as Lord Henry. With elegant <i>fin de sicle</i> sets superbly shot by Harry Stradling, and the ironic Wildean wit understated rather than overplayed, it's that rare thing: a Hollywoodian literary adaptation that both stays faithful and does justice to its source.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Flimsy Ruritanian whimsy adapted from Terence Rattigan's damp coronation year divertissement, <i>The Sleeping Prince</i>. A rather condescending vehicle for Monroe, who had demonstrated astonishing range and skill the previous year in <i>Bus Stop</i>, with Olivier's leaden direction constantly conveying the impression that real actors are graciously propping up the pretty novice. Few sparks fly, but Olivier's Teutonically humourless Regent of Carpathia - in Britain for the 1911 coronation of George V - is nicely played off against Marilyn's innocently saucy showgirl.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A lovingly literate adaptation of Guy de Maupassant's novella about a soldier (Sanders) returning from the wars without prospects, persuaded to capitalise on the good looks that seem irresistible to women, and finding it difficult to get off the roundabout even when he falls genuinely in love (with the wonderful Lansbury). Set in a stylish evocation of 19th century Paris partly based on contemporary paintings, and partly (like the London of <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>) a vivid product of the imagination, the film fascinatingly refuses to stigmatise its hero as he becomes increasingly and tragically mired. If there is a villain, it is a society so dependent on the appearances of success that everyone in it is encouraged to adopt a facade to reap their just rewards. In a series of elliptical asides that combine into a wry comment on the non-status of the career woman at that time, Lewin even contrives to suggest that the widow of a distinguished journalist who helps Sanders on his way to success not only secretly writes his copy, but had done the same for her husband for years. A sadly neglected film.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Marvellous 'sophisticated comedy' about a prototype dropout (Grant in one of his best performances) who takes a rich upper class family by storm: arriving engaged to the conventionally snobbish younger daughter (Nolan), stirring up latent doubts and resentments through his carefree disregard for material proprieties and properties, he ends up by showing the yearningly dissatisfied elder sister (Hepburn) the way to a declaration of independence. Despite some very funny barbed dialogue, mostly centering on two clashing couples among the engagement party guests (one liberal, the other proto-Fascist), the film is less a satire on the rich than an acknowledgment that privilege has its drawbacks; its key scene, accordingly, takes place in the nursery playroom, a place redolent of childhood hopes and dreams, which Hepburn and her unhappily alcoholic brother (Ayres) unconsciously use as a retreat from their unwelcome social obligations. Often underrated by comparison with The Philadelphia Story (both are based on plays by Philip Barry), but even better because its glitteringly polished surface is undermined by veins of real feeling, it is one of Cukor's best films.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An analytical account of the State of the (Soviet) Union at a crucial transitional stage, this is one of the most seminal and therefore controversial films in the history of cinema. Vertov's exhilarating and often hilarious exploration of the relations between cinema, actuality and history opened up all the issues Godard, the avant-gardes, and political film-makers have been wrestling with ever since. The film cannot easily be slotted into any single tradition, because it poses all the questions about the status of representation which dominant cinema represses. A truly radical and liberating work.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In this adaptation of EM Forster's posthumously published novel, a gay man in Edwardian England is seen to have three choices. Like Durham (Grant), he can opt for frigid, respectable marriage; like Viscount Risley (Tandy), he can solicit soldiers in bars and be grateful for six months' hard labour; or, most bravely, like Maurice (Wilby), he can risk everything for requited love. It takes a long time for Maurice to reach this point; only in the arms of his game-keeping bit of rough (Graves) does he realise that he's been taught 'what isn't right'. The initial stages, set in Brideshead country, are jerky, but thereafter the original's social comedy and serious passion are superbly evoked. The performances are excellent, the period trappings, like the love scenes, in the best possible taste.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Minnelli's captivating musical still comes up fresh as paint with each successive viewing, as charmingly, romantically nostalgic as an old valentine. One reason, quite apart from the wit and warmth of the characterisations or the skill with which Minnelli integrates the numbers, is that the seismic little shudders of dismay that shake the St Louis family of 1903 - threatened with a move to New York, where father has a better job waiting - seem to hint at the end of an era and the disappearance of a world where such uncomplicated happiness can exist. It's a feeling which the self-enclosed formality of the film encourages, with its division into four acts, each introduced by a filigreed tintype from the family album which gradually springs to life. One of the great musicals.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Nolan's <i>Following</i> was one of the most original British films of the '90s, and this follow-up makes no compromise. It opens with reverse action: a Polaroid photo fading and sliding into the camera, a corpse returned to life, a gun pulled from the head, a bullet sucked into the barrel. The action thereafter plays forwards as usual - with Leonard Shelby (Pearce) out to track down and take revenge on whoever raped and killed his wife - save that the brief narrative chunks flash ever further backwards in time, so that we share Shelby's confused point of view. He suffers from a rare kind of memory loss whereby, while he remembers life before the murder, he's been unable since then to recall anything for more than a few minutes. Hence he's forever forced to fathom afresh everything he sees and hears. The photos he takes for future reference and words he tattoos into his flesh help, but life remains a mysterious, very risky business. This taut, ingenious thriller displays real interest in how perception and memory shape action, identity and, of course, filmic storytelling. Moreover, a plot strand featuring Stephen Tobolowsky even touches the heart. There's grade A work from all concerned, especially Pearce, but in the end this is Nolan's film. And he delivers, with a vengeance.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The Congo, 1960: soldier-of-fortune Taylor braves rebel-held territory to rescue the white folk and retrieve a fortune in diamonds for President Ubi. The political backgound is skated over so we can get on with a crude variation on the cowboy-and-injuns schtick and plenty of lip-smacking carnage. Tricked out with an ex-Nazi (Carsten) still sporting a swastika, a disheveled blonde Belgian refugee (Mimieux), a loyal African sergeant (Brown), and a dipso English doctor (More) who sacrifices himself for a woman in labour, the film has an exceptionally unsympathetic hero and a preposterous moral turn-round at the close.

      <review><![CDATA[The action of Losey's film takes place against the Nazi deportation of French Jews - a set of circumstances which the film doesn't so much explore as get lost in. Klein (Delon), a Parisian art dealer, is delivered a copy of a Jewish newspaper. Investigating this, he becomes aware of a mysterious Jewish alter-ego bearing the same name. Though they do not meet, Klein finds the other impinging increasingly on his life, even living in his flat when he's not there. The confusion of identities forces Klein to defend himself against a charge of being Jewish. Predictably, the film ends with his deportation; quite unaccountably, Losey makes this a deliberate choice, as Klein purposely avoids the lawyers bringing the evidence which can release him, a piece of fatalism which resolves nothing whatsoever. Sadly, Losey's determinedly enigmatic treatment turns a potentially very interesting theme into cheap mystification.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Somerset Maugham's Gauguin-inspired novel is well and faithfully served by Lewin's characteristically literary direction; Sanders, especially, savours the elegant dialogue and cool ironies in his role as the quiet suburban broker who suddenly throws it all in, and leaves London and his family to embark upon a painting career in Paris. Indeed, the actor was the perfect choice for the part, his impeccably supercilious intelligence conveying both the self-centredness and the determination of a man with a private mission which he believes transcends social niceties. If the studio sets weaken the final scenes in Tahiti, Lewin's sensitivity to Maugham's moral nuances ensures unusually sophisticated Hollywood entertainment.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It's unfortunate that <i>The Wages of Fear</i> is virtually the only Clouzot film that anyone remembers, since his real background lies in a much more traditional French thriller vein, of which <i>Quai des Orfvres</i> is a fine example. The plot is suitably marginal: a hard-times couple (Blier, Delair) whose marriage is crumbling find themselves implicated in a murder. Clouzot doesn't waste a moment over the rampant implausibilities, but devotes all his energies to a romantically bleak evocation of the low-life settings: run-down music-halls, squalid apartments and gloomy police stations, peopled with lonely hookers, lesbians and pornographers. Jouvet's Maigret-esque cop gets all the best lines, and gives the film its human, tragic focus.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Pushkins marvellously histrionic tale of cupidity and terrible vengeance gets a suitably wild-eyed treatment in Thorold Dickinsons 1949 film. In Tsarist Russia, Captain Herman Suvorin (Anton Walbrook) watches enviously as aristocratic officers lose more at the card table than he can expect to see in a lifetime. He hears of an old countess (the wonderful Edith Evans) who knows the secret of winning at cards, and determines to use her pretty ward to force her to reveal it. The upshot is a tense, increasingly scary battle between good and evil that  despite Walbrooks Austrian accent and everyone elses cut-glass RP  displays excesses which feel authentically Russian enough to have made Eisenstein proud.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Lewin's weakest film, which he adapted from a French novel (<i>Echec au destin</i> by Francis D'Autheville), is set in Morocco and deals with the efforts of a Parisian doctor (Ferrer), abetted by the progressive, French-educated Caid (Wilde), to stamp out witch-doctoring in the villages. He begins with a successful field operation on lovely young Saadia (Gam), popularly believed to be possessed by devils, for acute appendicitis; whereupon the evil Fatima (Rotha) sharpens up her spells to conjure vengeful demons. You can see why Lewin wanted to make it, since the doctor's sceptical stance allows Lewin to pursue his own scholarly preoccupation with the rational foundations of myth and superstition. But the plot is a fine old farrago, choppily strung and drained of all credibility by the pot-pourri cast: Michel Simon as a bandit chief, Cusack as a wise old <i>mullah</i>, Wilde and Gam as Hollywood hero and heroine, Ferrer about as expressive as a block of wood. Some fascinating details, and good camerawork (Christopher Challis) where crude colour processing permits.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
One of the best of Lloyd's thrill-comedies, developing the precarious perch-clinging scenes in earlier shorts like <i>High and Dizzy</i> and the stunning <i>Never Weaken</i>. If he steered clear of the cloying sentimentality that characterised Chaplin and Langdon, Lloyd nevertheless lacked the narrative and visual ambitions that made Keaton a truly great director/comedian. That said, the clock-hanging climax that caps this generally charming tale of a country boy out to make his fortune in the big city - having suggested a high-rise climb as a publicity stunt for the store where he is employed, he finds himself forced to substitute when the real 'human fly' proves otherwise engaged - is a superb example of his ability to mix suspense and slapstick.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Pasolini's last movie before his being brutally murdered may now seem strangely prophetic of his death, but it is undeniably a thoroughly objectionable piece of work. Transporting De Sade's novel to Mussolini's Fascist republic of 1944, Pasolini observes with unflinching gaze the systematic humiliation and torture of beautiful young boys and girls, herded into a palatial villa by various jaded, sadistic members of the wealthy upper classes. According to the director, the story was meant to be a metaphor for Fascism, but the revolting excesses shown on screen (shit-eating and sexual violence included), coupled with the fact that the victims seem complaisant in, rather than resistant to, their ordeals, suggest murkier motives in making the movie. It's <i>very </i>hard to sit through and offers no insights whatsoever into power, politics, history or sexuality. Nasty stuff.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Imagine getting letters from a friend in Japan, letters full of images, sounds and ideas. Your friend is an inveterate globe-trotter, and his letters are full of memories of other trips. He has a wry and very engaging sense of humour, he's a movie fan, he used to be quite an activist (though he was never much into 'ideology'), and he's thoughtful and very well read. In his letters, he wants to share with you the faces that have caught his eye, the events that made him smile or weep, the places where he's felt at home. He wants to tell you stories, but he can't find a story big enough to deal with his sense of contrasts, his wish to grasp fleeting moments, his recurring memories. Above all he hopes to excite you, to share his secrets with you, to consolidate your friendship. Now stop imagining things and go to see <i>Sans Soleil</i>, in which Marker, the cinema's greatest essayist, sums up a lifetime's travels, speculations and passions. Among very many other things, his film is the most intimate portrait of Tokyo yet made: from neighbourhood festivals to robots, under the sign of the Owl and the Pussycat.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A slack and superficial adaptation of Lawrence's novel. Laudably avoiding the temptation to sensationalise Paul Morel's amorous adventures, the film finds little else to stress, since these affairs take up an awful lot of screen time, while the character's inner conflicts (with his background, his mother etc) are left ill-defined and inconclusive. Great care has been taken with the period atmosphere (splendid camerawork by Freddie Francis), but the rather stiffly literary dialogue makes it all look like a series of animated Edwardian tableaux.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Adapted from Patricia Highsmith's novel, <i>Strangers on a Train</i> takes as its central proposition the meeting and ensuing guilty association of two complete strangers, Granger and Walker. Walker buttonholes Granger, a star tennis player anxious to remarry but with a clinging wife, and initiates a hypnotic discussion of exchange murders. Walker then does 'his' murder (the wife), and threatens to incriminate Granger if he doesn't fulfil his half of the 'bargain' (Walker's father). Significantly, Hitchcock didn't use much of Raymond Chandler's original script, because Chandler was too concerned with the characters' motivation. In place of that, Hitchcock erects a web of guilt around Granger, who 'agreed' to his wife's murder, a murder that suits him very well, and structures his film around a series of set pieces, ending with a paroxysm of violence on a circus carousel, when the circle Granger is trapped within is literally blown to pieces, leaving Walker dead beneath it and Granger a free man again.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Larry Cohen's demons have never been your average little devils: Q the Winged Serpent lived atop the Chrysler Building, his anti-Christ lived in a Brooklyn basement, and J Edgar Hoover wasn't exactly human. This one is a white glop which comes bubbling out of the ground, tastes nice, and is immediately mined and marketed by a fast food chain under the logo 'Enough is never enough'. In other words, the monster doesn't come after you, you have to go out and consume it. Once eaten, it does strange things to people. Leading the anti-Stuff campaign for the forces of good is Michael Moriarty, in his customary persona as the laid back bozo who isn't as stupid as he looks ('Nobody is as stupid as I look'). As usual, Cohen's humour is chaotic (importing a right wing private army for the finale), surreal, and very, very subversive. If the drive-in crowd took its message to heart, they'd never eat again. <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i> for our time. CPea.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
As entertaining as it's intelligent, this delightful 'Scope animation from Warner Bros is adapted from Ted Hughes' anti-Cold War children's book. In a small town in Maine in 1957 (year of the Sputnik launch), young adventurer Hogarth, son of single mother and waitress Annie, is obsessed with things extra-terrestrial. Due in part to his school's nuclear-protection TV sessions, he's especially concerned about the Red Invader. He's the only one to take seriously a fisherman's frantic reports of the landing of a metal giant, and his search is rewarded by the sighting of a metal crunching, electricity-immune 50-footer in the forest. A friendship grows - the 'brain-damaged', perhaps war-oriented machine is educated by the boy like a 'wild child' - as government agents close in. Thank heaven, Hogarth's beatnik pal Dean runs the scrapyard and can provide, simultaneously, food and shelter - but for how long? This moral film effectively dramatises the war between imaginative, responsible solutions on the one hand, and gung ho, nuke 'em rule of force on the other, without losing sight of youngster friendly action-movie requirements.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An effortlessly high-spirited, beautifully bedecked romp through Dumas, with Fairbanks revisiting his favourite role as D'Artagnan. It's also a fond farewell to Fairbanks' own screen youth and the gaiety he'd shared with audiences over a decade, with the plot following the valiant musketeers through a 20-year separation, reunification and a final leap into heaven and a greater adventure beyond. Aside from a shaky five minutes at the start of the second half, it's perfectly pitched, paced and  performed.

      <review><![CDATA[Northern China, the 1920s. Having agreed - to spite both her stepmother and fate - to become the fourth wife of an ageing, wealthy clan-leader, 19-year-old Songlian (Gong Li) finds herself immured in a palatial complex plagued by paranoia, jealousy and intrigue. The red lanterns, hung outside the suite of whichever wife is currently the object of the master's attentions, are an index of power; and Songlian, determined to wrest control from her rivals, feigns pregnancy. But the real power, of course, lies with the master, and the women's in-fighting yields tragic results. Dealing, like <i>Red Sorghum</i> and <i>Ju Dou</i>, with a young woman married to an older man and struggling to survive in a society defined by oppressive patriarchal tradition, Zhang's film elicits a strong sense of <i>dj vu</i>. The lavish, schematic colours hold considerable appeal, while the atypical symmetry and stillness of the compositions stress the strait-jacket mores of a stagnant feudal culture. The acting is excellent, too, but one can't help but feel that Zhang has said it all before and more imaginatively.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[More shrewdly judged than <i>TwentyFourSeven</i>, this is a small picture with a deceptively big kick. In terms of scale, you can't get much more down-to-earth than a portrait of a couple of 12- to 13-year-old boys growing up on a Midlands estate. Romeo (Shim) is a jolly, well nourished lad, who lives next door to his best friend Knocks (Marshall). The boys are inseparable - until they meet Morrell (Considine), who takes Romeo under his wing. Knocks he despises: because of his limp, and because he plays a prank which humiliates Morrell in front of his sister Ladine (McClure). Meadows begins with the kind of honest attention to detail you find in Ken Loach, then, like Mike Leigh, builds up comic observation almost to the point of caricature, but with none of Leigh's latent contempt. He likes these boys for their foibles, their vulnerability and fecklessness as much as for their fundamentally good nature. But the joker in the pack is Morrell, and Considine's dangerous comic turn, which twists the film from affectionate larkiness to arrive at some genuinely shocking conclusions about what it may be that constitutes 'manhood'. Throw in a soundtrack featuring The Specials, Ian Brown, Beth Orton, Billy Bragg and Fairport Convention. This smashing movie is fresh, true and poignant as a song.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Varda's tribute to her husband Jacques Demy, who died in 1990, takes the form of a fictional reconstruction of the boy Jacquot's childhood, deriving its sense of authenticity not only from being shot in the real locations where Demy grew up, but from the fact that he himself collaborated with Varda, sifting through his memories. Home footage of Demy - together with clips from his films - casts an uncomfortably melancholic gaze on the proceedings. Extremely evocative, and vivaciously played by a cast of unknowns, this is a curious hybrid: part essay, part nostalgic reconstruction, at times sitting a little too cosily with the French vogue for faultlessly authentic reminiscence. Varda's valedictory may not bring you any closer to Demy the director, but it's an engrossing, moving tribute.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Impossible to deny this film's entertainment value, even if it's hardly the great classic it's often claimed to be. Bogart, hammier than usual and thus managing to win an Oscar, is the gin-swigging, cussing river trader who helps prim missionary Hepburn to escape the Germans in East Africa during World War I. Their trying odyssey downriver, of course, gradually sees the two incompatibles falling in love, with the as always detached Bogart finally discovering commitment and attacking a German gunboat. A witty script by James Agee (from CS Forester's novel) and fine colour photography by Jack Cardiff help to counteract the basically contrived and implausible nature of the story.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Berlin, 1943. As bombs fall, the last Jews are tracked down. Felice (Schrader) helps her newspaper boss with another anti-Semitic editorial. He's unaware that she's a Jew and a lesbian. Bravado might be the best protection, but Felice and a group of Jewish girlfriends live on their nerves. This partly explains why she is drawn to Lilly (Khler), the wife of a Nazi officer. Calling each other by pet names, Aime and Jaguar, they strive to keep the outside world at bay. The precarious existence of Felice and her pals provides background tension, but the film leaves niggling questions unanswered. There's an imbalance in the casting, too, since the bird-like Schrader carries far more charisma than Khler's sturdy Aryan housewife. The idea of passion defying the Nazis gives the film (based on a true story) its muted emotional charge, but, all in all, it isn't sharp enough to allow us to relive a fascinating, dangerous relationship through the lovers' eyes.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Tonio (Flemyng) is the leading light of the Ballet Luna, and probably the last: with its ranks decimated by AIDS, and Luna (Tutin) going down with Alzheimer's, the company is in an advanced stage of disrepair. Offered the lead in a valedictory production of an old success, 'Indian Summer', Tonio throws himself into the part. It could be the chance of a lifetime, because he too has AIDS; then again, perhaps the hard work is also an evasion - isolated, confused and emotionally disoriented, he's already accepted the virus as a death sentence on his love life. Then he meets Jack (Sher), HIV-negative, but interested, despite Tonio's rebuffs. How better to extend one's horizons than a relationship with a dumpy, balding older man who can't dance? This remains solidly in the tradition of gritty British realism, resolutely unglamorous and looking always rather TV-bound. However, Martin Sherman's script, adapted from his stage play, is cogent and witty, and steers clear of the downbeat worthiness of the AIDS-drama ghetto towards the more invigorating realms of contemporary gay courtship.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Based on Erich Maria Remarque's pacifist novel and renowned as the classic anti-war movie - it details the slow but steady extermination of a group of idealistic young German soldiers in World War I - the film's strength now derives less from its admittedly powerful but highly simplistic utterances about war as waste, than from a generally excellent set of performances (Ayres especially) and an almost total reluctance to follow normal plot structure. It is in fact the often relentless depiction of unflagging warfare and suffering that eventually pummels one into feeling, rather than understanding, the film's message.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The last of Wajda's unplanned trilogy about the legacy of World War II on his generation, following <i>A Generation </i>(1954) and <i>Kanal</i> (1956), <i>Ashes and Diamonds </i>is also the most flamboyant, and features the iconic figure of Cybulski, frequently cited as the 'Polish James Dean', who died in an accident in 1967. The time is the first days of peace, though from Cybulski's dark glasses the mood could be a decade on. He plays a young fighter waiting to assassinate a recently appointed communist official in a small Polish town. But a burgeoning love affair with a hotel barmaid leads him to question the value of this continual struggle. Wajda's way is the sweet smell of excess, but some scenes remain powerfully memorable - the lighting of drinks on the bar, the upturned Christ in a bombed church, and Cybulski's prolonged death agonies at the close.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Started by John Ford, who retired because of illness, this is an intelligent, powerfully cast, if slightly too pretty-pretty looking biography of Sean O'Casey. Taylor is excellent in the title role, digging ditches to support his mother (Robson) and sickly sister (Phillips), screwing his way through Julie Christie's chorus girl and Maggie Smith's demure librarian, dropping in on Michael Redgrave's WB Yeats and Edith Evans' literary sponsor, and still finding time to pen a line or two and support revolutionary causes. Ending with the first night of <i>The Plough and the Stars</i>, which Ford filmed in 1936, this undervalued picture deserves a look.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The setting for the second film in Wajda's trilogy about WWII (coming between <i>A Generation</i> and <i>Ashes and Diamonds</i>) is the sewers of Warsaw, through which a group of partisans attempt to make their escape from the Nazis during the 1944 Uprising. This was the film that made Wajda's name in the West, and it certainly has a unique intensity and gloom, with most of the characters enduring appalling fates: two lovers reach an exit to find it sealed off with a grill, another man surfaces right into German hands. Nevertheless, scenes such as the musician playing Chopin amid the ruins have a peculiar poetry that speaks of an experience that demands to be reinvented.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A surprise summer hit in the States, this is another film-making-by-numbers exercise in teenage wish-fulfilment. A Jewish divorce moves to California from New Jersey, and her son, a male Carrie called Daniel, has terrible trouble fitting in with West Coast ways. His first incipient romance runs foul of the girl's ex, a blond thug who trains at the local karate dojo run by a deranged Vietnam veteran. Fortunately his E.T. comes along in the form of an elderly Okinawan karate master, who not only becomes his special, secret friend but also handily teaches him persistence, inner strength, moral values and karate - which lead him into an apotheosis worthy of <i>Rocky</i>. This is actually director Avildsen's first hit since <i>Rocky</i>, and it has the same mixture of calculation and apparent navet. It borrows its formula from both East and West with good humour, and is completely free of intelligence, discrimination and originality. No wonder it was a hit.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A minor gem of pre-war French cinema, about a small bourgeois town invaded by Spanish soldiers in early 17th-century Flanders. Feyder declared his intention of bringing to life Flemish painting, an end he achieves nearly perfectly through a combination of masterly use of studio sets and costumes and Harry Stradling's gorgeous photography. Faced by the cowardly reaction of their burgher husbands, the women of the town decide to save themselves by preparing a lavish welcoming feast for the bloodthirsty Spaniards. The film is distinctly ambiguous about which appetites are being satisfied and how, and about the politics of occupation - is it advocating collaboration or subversion? For this reason, Feyder found it wise to exile himself from Nazi-occupied France a few years later. Either way, though, it remains a distinctly amiable sex comedy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Not before time, the kids are taking over. Well, grown-ups these days just don't cut it. Or if not kids, then a kid... Neatly dovetailing with the sentiments of <i>Whale Rider</i>, this animated elaboration of a Senegalese folk tale brings us (pace Rick Moranis) surely cinema's smallest hero - Kirikou, a preternaturally walking, talking, indefatigable newborn. Not one to beat around the bush, Kirikou summons his own birth aloud from inside his mother in the first minute of the film, and he's no sooner out in the world than trying to remedy it. He emerges into a village short on gold, water and menfolk, all these and more requisitioned by Karaba, the implacable sorceress down the way. 'Why?', Kirikou demands to know, and not taking 'you're too young to understand' for an answer, he quickly progresses from freeing his uncle and fellow children from the enchantress's clutches to hatching a plan to dig beneath Karaba's encampment to the wise man of the mountain on the other side. All this, and still the villagers doubt his worth... At least they know how to beat the drum when fortune favours them (music courtesy of Youssou N'Dour). The directors animates the tale in a simple but unsparing chromatic style, typically using two-dimensional profile perspectives. Perhaps they've taken a lesson from the protagonist: for all the film's sense of magic, Kirikou turns out to be a level-headed logician at heart, thinking out his dilemmas in delightful internal monologues. It's a great package: salutary, short (74 minutes) and sweet.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In re-adapting the John W Campbell story (<i>Who Goes There?</i>) already filmed so superbly in 1951 as <i>The Thing from Another World</i>, Carpenter provides a punchy enough action thriller as the men of a lonely Antarctic research team are menaced by a shape-changing alien from outer space. But there comes a time when spectacular special effects - even by the estimable Rob Bottin - are just not enough. Carpenter avoids the subtle suspense of the earlier version - all the guessing and paranoia and wonder - in favour of a mindlessly macho monster mash which looks and feels just like an ineptly plotted remake of <i>Alien</i>, right down to the chest-bursting scene. Russell's sub-Eastwood heroics hardly compensate for the absence of all characterisation, while Bill Lancaster's script boasts the most illogical climax any monster movie ever had. It's only fair to add that, had this been made by anybody else, one might be recommending it for its special effects; but that's the price Carpenter pays for having made so much better movies.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Re-released as part of the NFTs Carol Reed season, The Third Man continued the directors collaboration with Graham Greene and, like The Fallen Idol, its about secrets, lies and the tension between naivet and loyalty. The location, however, has shifted from London. Summoned to occupied post-war Vienna by his schoolfriend Harry Lime, brash American pulp writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives to find his old chum being widely mourned, especially by the actress Anna (Alida Valli), though less so by British Major Calloway (Trevor Howard). In this quartered, ruined, double-talking city, however, its as well to take nothing at face value<br />A considerably more harmonious collaborative effort than Allied powersharing, The Third Man remains among the most consummate of British thrillers: Reed and Greenes sardonic vision of smiling corruption is deliciously realised with superb location work, a roster of seasoned Viennese performers and the raised eyebrow of Anton Karas jaunty zither score.<br />Although his screen time is famously scanty, Orson Welles Harry haunts each scene: everywhere and invisible, hes a smirking Cheshire cat of a villain, a superb case study in shameless charisma as poisonous contagion. Audiences, like many of the characters, have tended to fall for his charms, fondly recalling the privilege of being taken into his confidence rather than the rotten core it conceals. The film, however, is less charitable, pursuing the performer backstage into the sewers, sick bowels of the city he lords it over. Playing American heroics against British pragmatism, elements of noir against horror (the empty grave, the burning torches), The Third Man is suffused with irony yet ultimately serious-minded: without personal responsibility, it says, there is no hope for civilisation  however charming the smirk.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Other English Hitchcocks may be more provocative, but few offer such a ripping good yarn. Donat's smooth and upright Richard Hannay flees from London in pursuit of a spy ring, responsible for leaving a murdered woman in his flat; the police inevitably take him for the murderer, and the spies are after him too. His itinerary includes an overnight stop in John Laurie's crofter's cottage, a political meeting where he improvises a speech without knowing who or what he's supporting, and a period when he's handcuffed to the resentful heroine. It ends, suitably, in a music hall. The inspiration came from John Buchan's novel, though Hitchcock followed it at some distance, concocting with scriptwriter Charles Bennett what really amounts to a little anthology of Hitchcock stories and motifs. Great fun.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Mackendrick and Ealing's resident American writer William Rose had already collaborated on <i>The Maggie</i> when they came together again for this, the last, most enduring and best known of all the studio's comedies, in which the sheer blackness of the central concept is barely disguised by the accomplished farce which surrounds it. Little Katie Johnson, the innocent hostess to a gang who find it easier to silence each other than her, proves resistant to science (Guinness' fanged 'Professor'), strategy (Parker's 'Major') and all shades of brute force and ignorance as she unwittingly foils a criminal getaway that never reaches beyond St Pancras. A finely wrought image of terminal stasis, national, political (Charles Barr suggests the gang as the first post-war Labour government), and/or creative (the house as Ealing, Johnson as Balcon??). Whatever, Mackendrick immediately upped for America and the equally dark ironies of <i>Sweet Smell of Success. </i>PT.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A widowed professor (Ryu) and his grown-up daughter (Hara) share a life of domestic tranquillity in a Tokyo suburb, but when he is made to realise that this girl should now be married, Ryu gently overrules her reluctance and arranges a suitable match - a Gary Cooper lookalike! Some rate this simple, affecting film even above <i>Tokyo Story</i>. Certainly it contains passages of great beauty and humanity, and there can be no faulting the heartbreaking performances of Ryu and Hara in roles very similar to the ones they play in the later picture. It was a favourite of the director's too (Ozu lived with his own mother throughout his life) - but it must be said that while the emotions are universal, the social customs which engender them seem more 'foreign' here than in most of the oeuvre. Hara's disgust at the thought that a widower should remarry, for example. Nevertheless, this is a remarkable, piercing film, and central to an understanding of Ozu's work. He tackled much the same story in colour in 1962's <i>An Autumn Afternoon</i>, his last film.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Probably not the finest Ealing comedy (although it does include an astute parody of the car chase in Ealing's own <i>The Blue Lamp</i>), but still one of the few enduringly funny movies in British cinema. Seemingly mousy bank teller (Guinness) teams up with seedy entrepreneur (Holloway) and two Cockney spivs (Bass and James) to steal gold bullion and turn it into Eiffel Tower paperweights. It won a script Oscar for TEB Clarke, who divides his satirical jibes between the police, the press and the City. Come in late and you'll miss a glimpse, in the opening scene in Rio, of a young Audrey Hepburn.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Is this the most beautiful film ever made? Watching Viscontis 1963 saga of Sicilian aristocracy swamped by the mid-nineteenth century is like stepping into an old master, where the eye lingers rapturously over folds of velvet and the changing light. Like Lampedusa, the author of the novel, Visconti was born into the nobility, and one senses their empathy with the storys ruminative Prince, who realises his class is doomed. The writing and Burt Lancasters majestic performance add ideological complexity and emotional resonance  orchestrated by fine support including Alain Delon and Claudia Cardinale  but the films greatness lies in the way it makes the 1860s live. Viscontis attention to detail is one element, but theres something about the grace, squalor, tedium and elegance of the climactic ball sequence which goes beyond filmmaking into embodying a vanished way of life.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hans Christian Andersen is given the update in Disney's animated fairytale, the action punctuated by calypso and sweeping ballads as 16-year-old rebellious mermaid Ariel follows her one true, human love, handsome Prince Eric. When the affair is thwarted by her domineering father Triton, sea-witch Ursula offers to turn Ariel into a human for three days; but if she fails to secure a royal kiss in that time, she becomes Ursula's property. This return to traditional Disney territory is geared to captivate children while allowing them to maintain their street cred, largely by combining extravagant animated technique with ranging musical styles. The underwater scenes are spectacular: shimmering, illusory images set behind bold, primary sea life. Why, given this kind of creative care, do the film-makers resort to racial stereotyping for Ariel's crustacean servant?]]></review>

His job is to hunt the fugitives, but one day outside the bubble he discovers 'new' emotions with Jenny Agutter.

      <review><![CDATA[This lies in that fertile territory between fiction and documentary. Everything you see is actually there, but as Scofield's anonymous Narrator takes us through his 'journal' of 1992, what we hear goes way beyond the mere facts to embrace meditative reflection, political satire, erudite literary anecdote, mythification and offbeat humour. The 'story' is structured round three journeys undertaken by the Narrator and his friend/ex-lover Robinson (also unseen) to research the source of English Romanticism. But as the pair attempt to get a grip on the city's history, contemporary events distract them from their planned route and their focus on the past. Both a fascinating study of a culture in decline, and a scathing commentary on the effects of more than a decade of Conservatism, the film touches on figures as diverse as Baudelaire, John Major and the Chippendales. One of the most original British features in a long time.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A strangely unexciting but emotionally intriguing Hitchcock costume drama with echoes of <i>Rebecca</i> and <i>Suspicion.</i> Set in the 1830s, it details the aristocratic Bergman's disastrous marriage to rakish stable-hand Cotten, who is deported to Australia convicted of murder. When the Governor's nephew (Wilding) visits them, he finds her an alcoholic wreck, and suspects she is being poisoned. Slow, a mite predictable, and rather verbose, the film nevertheless has an elegance (thanks to long, sweeping takes) and a poignant romanticism that looks forward to Hitchcock's more pessimistic account of human relationships in <i>Vertigo.</i>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Continuing her memorial to her late husband, Varda turns from the life (<i>Jacquot de Nantes</i>) to the work, with a mixture of extracts, documentary footage and interviews. Essential viewing, obviously, for anyone at all in sympathy with Demy's 'universe'. Surprises include a glimpse of Jim Morrison visiting the set of <i>Peau d'Ane</i>, and Harrison Ford relating how he was picked by Demy to play the lead in <i>Model Shop</i> but was fired by Columbia for lacking star potential. Varda consults not only ex-colleagues but fans as well, all of whom are impressively fluent, in the French manner: 'For me, that film was a shining star, each point representing a Demy theme...']]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>With his autistic brother at his shoulder, accompanied by the wistful strum of Smogs Vessel in Vain and cine-cam childhood memories, Paddy Considines grizzly wayfarer wends his way down fields and country lanes in the preamble to Meadows latest rummage through English small-time masculine values; the pastoral tranquility barely ruffled by the steady purpose of his stride. Its a nonchalant image that only retrospectively conjures the ghosts of Harry Dean Stanton emerging from the desert in Paris, Texas, Clint riding into town in High Plains Drifter, or even the homecomings of Hamlet or Richard Lionheart Something is rotten in a Midlands village, though from initial appearances it runs no deeper than the petty drug-dealing, porn and Pot Noodles that characterise the lives of local goons Herbie, Soz, Tuff and Sonny. Considine busts their chops, steals their stash and daubs taunts on their walls before they have time to figure out who he could be; even when they do, they dont realise quite how scared they should be. </p>
<p>A gritted antithesis to Once Upon a Time in the Midlands, Meadows and co-writer Considines stripped-down revenge drama similarly transposes western archetypes to the modest back-cloth of their local manor, but to much more serious intent: male fecklessness is viewed through a far darker lens, and redemption is in short supply. Its a fascinating project, in terms of both its technique and ambition, and gloriously watchable: working with a young cinematographer (Danny Cohen) and a triumvirate of editors, Meadows has raised his visual craft to the level of his dexterity with actors, while Considine is as striking as lightning. Where the film stumbles is at the behavioural level; at least the hoodlums are the soul of shallowness, and the denouement makes a sudden leap of brutality. But better that than pat.

Wheres the clown fish? piped up a confused kiddie next to me. And I could see her point. Expensive, merchandised-to-the-gills computer animation? Set under the sea? Comparisons are inevitable with Pixars Finding Nemo, but theres a whole trawler-load missing from this fishily similar DreamWorks creation apart from a cute orange clown fish. Like a story. Or real charm.<br />Oscar (Will Smith) is a (deeply annoying) big-mouthed small fry at the bottom of the food chain. Theres whale poo  and then theres YOU, explains his local Whale Wash boss (Martin Scorsese). When fate offers Oscar the bling lifestyle hed never have the clams to afford on a platter, he snatches it with both fins. But <br />its based on a big white lie. And when Oscars bogus claim to be a Shark-slayer reaches the attention of reef boss Don Lino (Robert de Niro  down to the mole), the entertaining Godfather-in-a-Jaws-suit vows to make this boastful little celeb Sleep wid de fishes err the dead ones, I mean. <br />Its not just the jolly mafiosi sharks that make this a cold-blooded affair. Childlike wonder is out; product placement (Krispy Kelp doughnuts, Gup clothing, Coral-Cola) is in. Bubbly action and bright colours can only distract so long from a three-second-attention storyline that even a goldfish might find disjointed. Lenny the veggie shark with a bent towards dolphin transvestism and two pratt-falling Rasta jellyfish are honourable exceptions, but otherwise this oceans teeming with celebs not characters  ooh look, its a fish that looks like Angelina Jolie etc. Calling its hero Oscar was definitely tempting fate.

Setting aside The Blue Planet TV series from which this awestruck feature compilation is culled, this BBC-produced marine-life survey recalls nothing so much as the all-synthetic Finding Nemo. Its pretty cool that we can now recreate these entire worlds for manipulation at the drag of a mouse; cooler yet that we can record and share the real thing with free-roving modern cameras. Michael Gambons narration keeps a low profile, and the films opulent, silky symphonic images soon have you spellbound.

      <review><![CDATA[
Marstons alert, compelling drama joins the likes of Last Resort and In This World in putting a fully fleshed and motivated human face to the cultural bogeyman of third-world intruders. It delivers a drug-smuggling twist, but shows how morality becomes an abstraction in the face of the basic human urge for opportunity and self-realisation. Indeed, besides any Catholic parallels that the title harks to, this enterprising drug-mules story tellingly shadows the paradigm of the American Dream. <br />Maria (Catalina Sandino Moreno) is a bright young woman of restricted means; stuck in a small Colombian town, stifled by a feckless boyfriend, and chafing against the callous work rules at the local flower plantation, shes ripe and ready when a handsome stranger picks her up for a dance. Nor does she falter when he introduces her to his boss, who wants her to fly to New York carrying a bellyful of cocaine <br />Marston tracks Marias story with compassion, precision and thorough lack of flap. Paring away anything quirky or extraneous, the film offers Maria as an archetypal angel of burden, a lode of hopes, fears, struggle and survival, who transcends the stereotypical thanks to the sheer intelligent dignity and force of will that Sandino Moreno projects. Marston follows her progress with a non-judgemental, keenly anthropological eye; her Colombian hometown is drawn concisely and from within; the flight, its preparations and outcome are empathic and gripping; while the final act in New Yorks Little Colombia widens the films canvas and extends its sympathies. Perhaps the films simplicity and focus leave more detail to be desired, at least if youre already in accord with the films sympathies. But theres no denying that Sandino Moreno makes it very watchable.

      <review><![CDATA[Can I ask you a personal question? wonders Miles (Paul Giamatti), our paunchy anti-hero, as he leans in towards Maya (Virginia Madsen), a friend he knows from his regular trips to Californias vineyards. Why are you so into Pinot?<br />What a chat-up line. Yet this and other crucial questions concerning wine, men, love and friendship are the lifeblood of this low-key road movie about two middle-aged men, Miles and Jack (Thomas Haden Church), who take to the highway to explore Californias vineyards in the week before Jack gets married. <br />This odd, contrasting pair share little more than long-gone college days. Miles is a schoolteacher, aspiring novelist and divorc with a near-desperate obsession for wine and a defeatist, hang-dog demeanour that indicates he is a depressed shell of his former self. Jack, meanwhile, is an out-of-work actor, fancies himself as a Casanova and still dines out on a long-gone, brief stint on a television soap opera. Their ideas of a holiday are very different: Miles just wants to drink wine and play golf, while Jack is determined to have one last fling before marriage and so engineers an evening with two local girls, Maya and Stephanie (Sandra Oh). Jack is in his element; Miles seems about to disintegrate.<br />Depression, loss and disappointment are at the heart of this film, which grounds a simple story of mismatched friends and road-movie mishaps in serious, intelligent and affecting themes. In their different ways, Jack and Miles are the embodiment of male crisis. Payne, meanwhile, demonstrates immense confidence by holding back both the humour and the pace of the film so that it trips along maturely like the lazy Californian sun that he indulges so well. He and co-writer Jim Taylor also have great fun with Miles oenophile tendencies, allowing for such gems of dialogue as quaffable, but far from transcendent. Intelligent, funny and moving.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An organic progression from his documentaries, Cohens feature debut  set in an overcast, flourescent netherworld of malls, hotels and transport interchanges  constructs a cohesive milieu from footage shot in seven countries and 11 US states. Researching American theme parks, Tamiko (Nikaido) awaits orders from her Tokyo corporation, whose mission statement becomes a kind of mantra; non-person Amanda (Billotte) scavenges from shopping centres, talks into a dead cell-phone and confides in a video camera. Ostensibly at opposite ends of the spectrum, the womens experiences of mallworld are similarly aimless and atomised, each well-versed in consumerism and bereft of human contact. Cohen finds grimly witty equivalence in litanies of chain-store names and debt relief voicemails, luxury-brand outlets and derelict pharmacies  a floating world where awnings promise Zero coming soon.<br />]]></review>

three disparate shorts"Ydessa, the bears and etc..." (2004), "Ulysse" (1982) 
and "Salut Les Cubains" (1962)have been turned into one documentary du jour. 
The film's compounded title, however, offers a clue to the triptych's underlying 
theme: Varda's own relationship to the mediums of film and photography 
themselves. Taken together, <i>Cinvardaphoto</i>'s whole is stronger than the 
sum of its parts, revealing the autobiography of an artist chasing personal 
memories through her art.

Having already suffered Madagascar, The Wild and Chicken Little, do we parents really want to endure another slice of CGI drivel? Praise the Lord, then, that Over the Hedge turns out to be far better than expected.<br />RJ the raccoon (voiced by Bruce Willis) is a foxy loner who knows every survival trick in the book. An experienced opportunist, hes not averse to procuring a human snack or two, even if it means stealing it from under the nose of Vince the bear (Nick Nolte). Its while escaping the clutches of Vince that RJ stumbles upon a ragbag community of woodland critters who have just emerged from hibernation only to discover a new housing project on their doorstep and a bloody great hedge blocking the way to what was once prime foraging ground. Verne the dyed-in-the-wool tortoise (Gary Shandling) is mistrustful of the new interloper, especially when he informs them that beyond the hedge lies more food than they ever dreamed of, even if it is of the junk variety. Nevertheless, needs must<br />Based on a popular US comic strip, Tim Antz Johnsons sparky film is competently animated, well paced and smartly conceived with imaginative characters, snappy voiceovers and some clever observational humour. I especially liked the way in which the film takes the mickey out of our Western methods and mores, our inexorable expansion into the green belts and our (or rather Americas) love-affair with junk food. It misses the mark a couple of times but in the main, its good clean fun.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Having seen every major computer-animated movie this year, some of them unutterably turgid, this writers heart sank at the prospect of a dancing penguin movie. As it turns out, Happy Feet is not only the most accomplished animated movie this year, its one of the years best films, period.<br />Mumble (voice of Elijah Wood) isnt fitting in with the rest of his Emperor penguin colony. His father, Memphis (Hugh Jackman), mother Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman) and the commanding elders are bemused by the misfit chicks propensity for tap dancing when, in fact, he should be breaking into song. But Mumbles first attempt at singing is a tuneless disaster, and the forlorn penguin is soon ostracised for bringing a curse upon the colony. Seems the penguins fish supplies have dwindled alarmingly, and Mumbles taking the rap. A short adventure later, he chances upon a troupe of rhythmic Adelie penguins, fronted by Robin Williams rockhopper, Lovelace. Lovelace has a plastic six-pack ring around his neck which he believes was bestowed on him by aliens. Its at this juncture the film veers away from its cute, gloriously lighthearted song-and-dance routines  with covers of The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Stevie Wonder, etc  to embrace a much darker tone, where initial intimations about social mores are replaced by an effective, soul-stirring environmental message.<br />Young kiddies may find a couple of near-death experiences with a sea lion and an orca a little too frightening to bear, but thats only because the standard of the animation is so outstandingly realistic and so acutely detailed. Director George Babe Miller has pulled off a coup with this one; hes raised the benchmark to a whole new level, both visually and conceptually. Bravo.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Most of this new 3-D IMAX film takes place not hundreds of fathoms below the surface as the title suggests, but among the much shallower coral reefs of the Gulf of Mexico, British Columbia and the Bahamas. Whatever, its still an awe-inspiring event; rather like scuba-diving without getting wet or running out of oxygen. Once again, the makers of 1994s Into the Deep have delivered a stunning tour dhorizon of life beneath the waves, where ugly sponge-like frog fish sit disguised among the coral awaiting a passing snack, and larger fish turn up at cleaning stations to have their scales purged of parasites by myriad multi-coloured tiddlers. As with some other IMAX presentations, the patronising style of dialogue here lets the side down: Johnny Depps okay, but Kate Winslet sounds too much like a nursery teacher addressing a group of three-year-olds. You may also wish for a more contemporary-sounding soundtrack than the orchestral one supplied by Danny Elfman. Personal taste aside, Deep Sea 3-D is still worthy of your attention, and marvellously educational eye-candy for scholars.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Once upon a time, an acquaintance of mine tried driving across England in a 15-year-old Citroen rigged to run on cooking oil  recycled chip fat, to be precise. Its arteries clogged with grease, the engine seized up not far into the journey, but my environmentally conscious friend might not have had to resort to such measures had the electric car had a longer, happier life on this overheated earth. In 1990, the state of California adopted a modest zero-emissions resolution; later that decade, General Motors responded with the EV-1, a battery-powered contraption that, for the few years it was available for lease-only in California and Arizona, inspired great enthusiasm from high-profile customers including Mel Gibson. Despite the inevitable hiccups that come with any new technology, compared to its gas-guzzling brethren, the electric car was cleaner, cheaper, easier to maintain, and far more environmentally and ethically sound. It just had to die.<br />The EV-1 is the beloved subject of Chris Paines documentary, which appeared earlier this summer in the States as petrol prices were skyrocketing in inverse proportion to George W Bushs approval ratings. Who Killed the Electric Car? features a tongue-in-cheek funeral for the EV-1 and proceeds as a murder mystery; its heavy on talking heads and hit-or-miss humour, but the movie also carries a surprising emotional weight, as the litany of corporate greed and willful stupidity piles up as depressingly as the stacks of EV-1s that GM recalled and crushed a few years back. Like his leftie-doc compatriots Michael Moore and Robert Greenwald, Paine is preaching to the choir, but the sermon should be heard nonetheless.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Be warned: this is not a conventional film about football. There will be no testimonials from former colleagues or gushings from besotted fans. There will be no mentions of worthy charitable works or side pieces on a famous spouses fashion choices. Zidane is an experiment in documentary narrative that takes one football match  Real Madrid against Villarreal on April 23 2005  and one footballer  Zindine Zidane de la head-butt  as its canvas. As a film, its not the wonderfully sublime experience that some critics at Cannes claimed it to be, but as an out-there, arty exercise in worshipful deconstruction, it is fascinating, slickly compiled and offers moments of beauty, reflection, amusement and intelligence.<br />Douglas Gordon and Philippe Parreno are artists who have incorporated cinema into their work before: Gordon slowed down Hitchcocks Psycho to two frames per second for his video piece, 24 Hour Psycho, while Parrenos No More Reality featured snatches of Gremlins and Twin Peaks. Here, the pair play further tricks with screen conventions by tracking Zidane for the entire length of a football match via 17 cameras placed around a football stadium. What we witness is not a football match as usual but Zidane during a football match, sweating, snorting, staring and, occasionally, putting foot to ball. Its hero worship in which every glance and tip-toe matters.<br />Most remarkable is the sound design. Mogwais dreamy music, deftly edited, lifts the film out of the world of sports and makes it personal to Zidane. The soundtrack, meanwhile, flits between this music and the roar of the crowd, between the private and the public. For all its strengths, Zidane probably belongs in the gallery, not the cinema, and doesnt beg its argument strongly enough for those who dont care for football. It mesmerises yet it also bores. Its a fascinating experiment and a frustrating film.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In 1987 Philip Grning approached the Grande Chartreuse monastery in the French Alps to ask if he could make a film about this reclusive establishment, known mainly for the bright green liqueur produced there. A mere 13 years later it agreed to his request, but with strictures that no crew or lights would be permitted, nor would the filmmaker be allowed to interrupt the monks devotions. He would, instead, have to live with them as they live. The resulting extended portrait (note the running time) is one of those rare celluloid experiences that truly transports us into another world, the Carthusian brothers daily round of study, worship and silence.The obvious approach here would have been to stick lots of Arvo Prt, say, on the soundtrack and mollify the audience with a faux-churchy tranquillizer, but Grning instead cleaves close to the values of his subject matter, shaping an austere but authentic vision through the  daily rhythm of candle-lit masses and cloistered study. Also registered are the passing seasons and the logistical upkeep of a routine unchanged for centuries, yet amid the tolling editing patterns and poised compositions, an intent focus on a new black novice and an ailing elderly blind monk sustain human interest too. Indeed, the key device whereby individual monks stare wordlessly into the lens offers up a haunting reminder that the pathway to the divine is a lonely and arduous route. More than any film outside Bresson, this non-judgemental document allows us to feel the spirituality of the ecstatic privations guiding their journey. A Christmas gift of time and contemplation.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A decade ago, the first cinema venture for Rowan Atkinsons cherishably eccentric comic creation was rather scuppered by a misguided plot which had Bean accompanying a famous painting to an LA gallery (why?). Still, the worldwide box-office take was healthy enough to make this sequel inevitable, and its certainly an improvement. This time, Simon McBurneys storyline makes sense on Beans terms: thanks to a church raffle, hes won a holiday to the South of France, and hes determined to make it to the Med in one piece. This entails negotiating the Eurostar, Parisian taxis and the TGV, while not losing his passport or the camcorder with which hes documenting the trip. All on three words of French  oui, non and gracias.<br />Its an astute set-up which has plenty of room for individual set-pieces  youll never look at a langoustine quite the same way again after Bean takes on the plateau de fruits de mer  but maintains momentum as the flexibly featured one encounters a lost Russian boy, Emma de Caunes aspiring actress and Willem Dafoes egomaniac filmmaker, all en route to the Cannes Film Festival. With its obvious nods to Tati, a surprise for Charles Trenet lovers and much humour at the expense of celluloid pretensions, theres ample diversion here for even the snootiest cinemagoer, inclusively set alongside the expected cavalcade of adeptly choreographed pratfalls to tickle the family audience. Hes just Mr Funny! piped up one excited little boy in the row behind me at the preview, and even if the final reel perhaps takes contrivance further than ones goodwill would usually allow, thats still a pretty fair assessment.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Haneke's new film is a near shot-by-shot remake of his 1997 film, only this time set in upstate New York with Naomi Watts and Tim Roth as George and Anna, a couple who arrive at their lakeside summer house with their young son, Georgie (Devon Gearhart) and are held hostage by Peter (Brady Corbet) and Paul (Michael Pitt), two clean-cut young men in white gloves who come knocking at their door looking for eggs. Those familiar with the Austrian original may find themselves distracted by the inevitable search for the (very few) differences between this and the original but should be thankful that Haneke has altered nothing of the distressing provocation of his earlier film by offering it up to a new, surely wider audience. As before, Haneke makes the viewer complicit with the screen horror in very creepy fashion, and his cast alll do justice to the original players. It's just a shame we have to wait a little longer for a genuinely new Haneke film.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The idea of surviving the Holocaust takes on many nuances in Stefan Ruzowitzkys stark and intriguing evocation of a largely unknown area of Second World War German history: the use of skilled prisoners to create counterfeit currency for Operation Bernhard, a plan to flood the British and American economies with fake cash. Ruzowitzky gives us Salomon Sorowitsch (Karl Markovics), a successful, Jewish forger in the pre-war Berlin of 1936 whose instinct for self-preservation, in peacetime as well as war, is best summed up by his nonchalant attitude to the creeping pogrom: I am me  and the others are the others.</p><p>Hours later, Salomon is arrested, and for the rest of the 30s and until the end of the war he finds himself putting his skills to a different use, first in Mauthausen and later Sachenshausen. He discovers that sketching Nazi officers brings a reward of better food, and soon his hosts transfer him to the golden cage, a hot-house of industry in the corner of a camp where uptight ex-bankers and criminals collude in producing dodgy notes in an environment of relative comfort. The films core dilemma emerges when the team are on the verge of cracking the dollar: if they continue, will they betray whatever political instincts they have left? And, if they succeed, will they become surplus to requirements and lose their privileges or, worse, be killed?</p><p>Its the latter quandry which highlights some of the films curious and daring psychologies. Were well-versed in Holocaust dramas in which the Nazis and the Jews are treated as separate, homogeneous entities; here, things are more complex. War doesnt bestow a new personality on Salomon, it simply offers a new context within which this lone gun  his background is strikingly sketchy  must survive. More importantly, Ruzowitzky is aware that not all moral standards can survive the perversity of the Holocaust. As such, were invited to observe the behaviour in this studio within the greater theatre of war and rarely to judge, even when it comes to the Nazis. Ruzowitzky handles this perspective to excellent effect: despite our awareness of the Holocaust, we only see what Salomon sees  or, crucially, wants to see  even though we, like him, can hear the sound of gun-shots outside. He directs with urgency, lingering little, employing ample jolt-zooms and dousing his film in a colour palette that takes its cue from the grey stripes of the prisoners uniforms.<br />His meshing of plot with debate is impressive. His film is compelling and clever.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[I can understand why some people might recoil at the thought of another British film set on a council estate. Is it worthy? Condescending? Grim? Is it more evidence of a young filmmaker awkwardly exercising their Mike Leigh/Ken Loach fetishes? Well, banish your fears: Andrea Arnolds follow-up to Red Road is a film that brilliantly and sensitively buzzes with life and offers its very own take on our world and our city. It delivers in spades attitude, humour, sadness, love, anger and hope  all wrapped up in a way of telling stories that is very much the directors own. Its realism, but it has an intimacy, an immediacy and a dash of poetry that offers a new spin on familiar territory.<br />Arnold has a keen eye for the border between danger and fulfilment when it comes to sexual feelings, and here she trains that eye on one vulnerable but strong adolescent teenage girl, Mia (Katie Jarvis), who you cant help but feel for and understand  even after we watch her call a friends dad a cunt and headbutt another girl so that the blood pours down her face. And thats just the first five minutes.<br /><br />Mia lives in a flat in Essex, near the Thames estuary, with her mum Joanne (Kierston Wareing) and her little sister Tyler (Rebecca Griffith). Mia calls her little sis fuck face and little sis calls her cunt face back. The TV blares out reality shows and makeover programmes. Outside, Arnolds camera sucks up the territory on which she films; flats, busy roads, flyovers, scraps of land and suburban shop parades all lend a strong sense of place without any sense of gawking or romanticising. This is Mias world and there it is: it can sometimes look ugly, sometimes look beautiful. Arnold and DoP Robbie Ryan shoot in the unusual 1.33:1 aspect ratio, so the screen is almost square, but Fish Tank feels more like a series of personal Polaroids than TV, the glare of the sun often dancing across the lens in the manner of home snapshots.<br />Nothing about all this feels miserable. It helps that Arnold tells her tale at the height of summer so that the sun is always shining. It also helps that Arnolds way of presenting Mia to us is to stay close to her at all times, to show us her world from her point of view. Crucially, were there, alone with Mia, when she regularly decamps to an empty flat and practices her hip hop dance moves. We know theres more to Mia than antagonism and kneejerk violence and were curious about whats going on in this girls head.<br />Were there, too, when her mum brings home a man, Connor (Michael Fassbender), who is soon living with them, doing the washing-up with his top off and taking them for a drive. Mias smiles show that she likes him, while he pays her more attention than anyone else in her life, praising her dance moves, giving her a piggyback, even tucking her up in bed when she pretends to be asleep. Their relationship takes unusual, even alarming turns, but always Arnold avoids obvious judgements, obvious explanations. Hers is an intimate drama of grey areas and all the better and more thoughtful  and thought-provoking  for it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This fiercely imaginative urban fairy tale from multitalented East End fabulist Philip Ridley, creator of The Reflecting Skin and The Passion of Darkly Noon, juxtaposes familiar Bethnal Green settings, fairy tales, disturbing violence and bleak, surreal humour. Jamie (Jim Sturgess, below), a melancholy 25-year-old photographer with a heart-shaped port-wine birthmark on his face, starts to believe that the masked hoodies prowling the streets are actual demons. His shy, tentative love for the fragile Tia (Clmence Posy) offers a ray of hope, but his Faustian pact with the charismatic Papa B (Joseph Mawle)  the self-styled patron saint of random violence  plunges Jamie into a frightening world of chaos. By showing us these bizarre events from Jamies point of view, Ridley forces us to share his hallucinatory vision of an apocalyptic world. The ever-brilliant Eddie Marsan contributes a darkly hilarious cameo as the enigmatic Weapons Man, and Ridleys coup de grace is a quiet, emotionally charged ending as surprising as it is bold.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Palestinian director Elia Suleimans most eloquent and moving feature to date is a fractured chronicle of two generations of the Arab-Israeli conflict which opens on the armed siege that led to the creation of the state of Israel and closes on a screwball portrait of life in present-day Nazareth and Ramallah. British audiences might know Suleiman from his 2002 film Divine Intervention, for which he framed the political discontents of the area in a series of acerbic and scrupulously choreographed tableaux and earned himself comparisons to Jacques Tati. The same visual style is applied here, although the tone is more elegiac and the focus is more anguished, more personal.<br /><br />Suleiman plays a version of himself in the film, but only during its apocalyptic final chapter. The content of much of the films opening two-thirds was inspired by the memoirs of his late father, a rebellious, angular gunmaker who  on this evidence  went through great physical and psychological pains to internalise his yearning for political resistance. Though Suleiman depicts the initial coup in grand, wham-bang fashion, this is no action movie, more a dryly comic dissection of the absurd behaviour of people living (and loving) under the clouds of political instability. In a scene where a celebratory photograph is taken when the mayor of Nazareth has officially ceded the land to occupying forces, the Palestinian clerics outside the shot are more engrossed by the photographers backside than the rictus grin of their superior. <br />Repetition is one of the films key motifs, and Suleiman is a master of positing an idea then building on it layer by layer as things move on. Often these instances are humorous, such as repeat viewings of an episode when the Suleimans depressed neighbour gets drunk then threatens to set himself on fire, only for Elias father to unflappably take the matches away from him, then tenderly lead him inside. But they can also be extremely poignant, such as the simple, beautifully composed shot of Elias elderly mother quietly drinking coffee on the balcony, contemplating her troubled past and uncertain future. In one tear-jerking variation of this set-up, a firework display erupts in the background and both Elia and his mother appear unaffected  the suggestion being that the constant ringing of gunfire throughout their lives has numbed them to its beauty.<br /><br />The problem with The Time That Remains is that once its over, its the limitations rather than the possibilities of Suleimans style that linger in the mind. You find yourself worrying about what hell do next rather than being excited by the prospect of another sojourn in his singularly deadpan universe.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Five years after The Death of Mr Lazarescu alerted the world that Romanian cinema was alive and happening comes this compact charmer from that films assistant director, indicating that the Romanian talent pool shows no sign of drying up. The vibe here is wry comedy-drama, as provincial high-school student Delia scoops a new car in a soft drinks competition and travels with her uptight parents to feature in the products latest TV ad. Unfolding over a single day, this witty look at the unglamorous nuts and bolts of screen magic follows the hassled crews attempt to complete a simple 35-second slot, except that the combination of inexperienced teenage prize-winner and nit-picking sponsors is not a productive one. They want Andrea Bosneags doughty heroine to look as if shes enjoying chugging down their Day-Glo orange brew, but after umpteen takes and several litres, her enthusiasm is waning<br /><br />Although the humour gets slightly stuck in the same furrow, theres obviously more at stake here, since this pointed vignette evidently encapsulates a society in transition  hence the mum and dad whove slaved through the Ceausescu years to support their only daughter now want to sell the shiny new hatchback to finance a countryside B&amp;B. Thankfully, the central metaphor never overwhelms the story, as the teenager refuses to relinquish the car and father sighs a deep sigh. Life is disappointing and youth will pass, he says, making one wonder if Yasujiro Ozu is big in Bucharest. Deftly done, and though undoubtedly small in scale, its satisfying stuff.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Theres no rule that says movie characters have to be likeable. In everything from Zoolander to Tropic Thunder, Ben Stiller has built a career on walking the fine line between playing the obnoxiously neurotic and haplessly loveable, pushing the viewer to the edge of disgust before reeling them back in for a touchy-feely finale. But as the hero of Greenberg, his first straight role in years, Stiller has finally decided to cut the audience loose altogether: this guys just a creep.<br />Whether we are supposed to think so remains in doubt. Hes certainly pitiable: recently released from a mental institution following a nervous collapse, fortysomething musician-turned-carpenter Roger Greenberg heads to LA to housesit for his brothers family, who are on holiday. While there, he meets the familys dog-walker and general dogsbody Florence (Greta Gerwig), whose recent run of romantic bad luck has left her vulnerable to the kind of spiky, self-pitying patter Greenberg specialises in.<br />As the tentative relationship between Roger and Florence develops, Greenberg becomes a film of shifting sympathies, though not to the extent that director Noah Baumbach and his co-author (and bit-player) Jennifer Jason Leigh seem to think it is. In The Squid and the Whale Baumbach proved himself adept at subtle emotional manipulation, and there are moments where we feel for Roger  one remarkable, edgy scene where he crashes a teen house party in a desperate attempt to relive his lost youth hints at the movie this could have been if wed been encouraged to identify just a little more closely with this shambling, self-involved loser.<br />It might also have helped if Baumbach hadnt cast such a note-perfect leading lady, but Gerwig is a pure pleasure, so tender, tentative and compassionate that it only makes us hate Greenberg all the more as he sweeps in and out of her life and her bed, taking her for granted. This deserves to be the role that breaks Gerwig into the big time, but we can only dream of what might have been had she been given centre stage.<br />And so Greenberg remains a film of powerful, memorable moments  some striking dialogue, some great performances, a handful of beautifully played, bracingly discomfiting love scenes  in search of a structure and, perhaps, a soul. One cant help admiring Baumbach and Stiller for refusing to bow to tradition and soften the impact of this abrasive character, but its equally impossible to shake the impression that Greenberg, both the character and the movie, is more interested in rubbing us up the wrong way than getting to the heart of things.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her fashion-conscious gal pals are back, and theyre taking the girl-power hi-jinks to a whole new level. First things first, though: the gay, gay, gay wedding of bestest friends Anthony Marantino (Mario Cantone) and Stanford Blatch (Willie Garson), where chorus boys sing Sunrise, Sunset, swans frolic among the guests, and Liza Minnelli officiates. Watching that queerest of queer icons risk her umpteenth hip replacement by performing Beyoncs Single Ladies (dance moves and all!) is as suspenseful as a Hitchcock set-piece, and a difficult act to top.<br />So writer-director Michael Patrick King doesnt even try. Instead, after this camp overture, were plunged headfirst into Carrie and friends familiar mock-troubled paradise: Ms Bradshaws relationship with the debonair Mr Big (Chris Noth) is moving further toward stifling domesticity. Neurotic mother Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is worried her braless live-in nanny has the hots for her hubby. Lawyer Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) quits her job after too many put-downs from her chauvinist boss. And Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is, well, horny as fuck. What a great time to take an all-expenses-paid trip to Abu Dhabi!<br />Taken in hand by this formidable foursome, the big, bad Middle East becomes a menopausal Westerners delight. One wrongheaded jaw-dropper follows another, from Samanthas description of a gay manservant as Paula Abdul to a comic climax in which the ladies escape an angry male mob by wearing hijabs and abayas given to them by like-minded Muslim women. And the featherbrained feminism the franchise specialises in reaches its apex when Carrie files her latest book, I Do. Do I?, beside Susan Sontags Against Interpretation. How do you say, In your dreams, girlfriend in Arabic? <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The UK tosses its hat into the 3D ring with this sweet-natured, London-set dance movie that, if nothing else, proves that gainful employment is in the realms of the possible for the fly-by-night famesters of Britains Got Talent. Bear-hugging convention with all its might, the film tells of Carly (Nichola Burley) and her attempts to whip her dancing crew in shape for a tournament. She does this by co-opting the help and resources of a compassionate ballet instructor (Charlotte Rampling  looking like shes having fun) who requests that they work on creating a dance routine that fuses the traditional with the modern. That the climactic dance resembles something from the dark recesses of Lloyd-Webbers dream archive is by the by: the movie has vim and spark in abundance and the filmmakers are canny enough to let the cast play to their strengths by keeping dialogue to a minimum and shoe horning in as many brilliantly choreographed dance sequences as the material will allow.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its 1959, West Texas: the sun is beating down and the sheriffs deputy, Lou Ford (Casey Affleck), is padding the quiet, widescreen streets of smalltown Central City like a model law enforcer, courteous and polite to the passing citizenry and neat in his blouson, tie and  the Southerners sacred badge of down-home decency  kidskin boots and wide-brim Stetson. But, hes walking through Jim Thompson country  the dissembling, rotten home ground of the nihilistic pulp novelist from whose shocking 1952 novel Michael Winterbottom has fashioned his first American movie  and nothing is as it first appears.<br /><br />The sarcastic faux banalities Lou offers people he meets, for his own light amusement, may betray a more complicated mind than the handsome young detective likes to make plain. Hes also shouldering a tragic past involving a lost brother-in-law which in-the-know locals (including union man Elias Koteas), the city fathers (including Ned Beatty), his secret long-term girlfriend Amy (Kate Hudson) and fellow police colleagues (including Tom Bowers sheriff) happily connive in keeping buried. But few realise that the man is a walking timebomb. However, the day soon comes when hes sent to chase off a local prostitute, the beautiful and fiery Joyce (Jessica Alba), and receives the slap that is to trigger in him an explosion of unexpected passion, intricate deceit and murderous self-destruction<br /><br />The film arrives on screens heralded by some box-office-boosting bad publicity, with shockwaves emanating from some who have witnessed the films face-pulverising, hard-to-stomach bouts of violence. Yet this again-atypical film from Winterbottom, the genre-swapping director of A Mighty Heart, Genova and The Road to Guantanamo, is a much more sober affair than its early, controversial press might suggest. <br />Faithful  awfully  to Thompsons devils-rsum-style source text and despairing worldview, it also occupies an emotional space of unnerving calm. The unfussy, if lazily expressive, cinematography (by Winterbottom regular Marcel Zyskind) of familiar 50s Americana, the unobtrusive set design of jail, courthouse and Texan home, and the relaxed, cowpoke-paced editing are all in concert with it. Together they produce a dirge-like accompaniment to a hypnotic and remarkable central performance by Affleck. <br />With his other Ford (movie-stealing coward Robert in Andrew Dominiks retro-western The Assassination of Jesse James) and his terrific turn as the Boston cop in his older brothers underrated Gone Baby Gone, the younger Affleck is arguably becoming the most compulsively watchable American actor of his generation. Hes capable of saving a pretentious film (The Assassination), giving a spine to a potentially diffuse one (Gone Baby Gone) and, as here, giving a sense of mystery and plaintive spirituality to a movie that would otherwise seem underpowered and uncertain of its own moral purpose or profundity. There are other good performances to enjoy  notably from Koteas and Alba  but its Affleck who justifies the price of your ticket.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Undoubtedly worthy, Britain's first major gay movie is nevertheless often excruciatingly dull, and in many ways highly pessimistic. Dealing with a schoolteacher who cruises the discos endlessly but remains in the closet at work - until, that is, a revelatory discussion with his pupils - the film fails through its sluggish pace and awkward amateur performances. Worst of all, however, is that it presents its hero as such a miserable sod; anyone tempted toward his own sex would surely be deterred after watching Robertson's endlessly unsmiling face.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
<p>This story isnt new  it comes to most wives, counsels Lucile Watsons sage matriarch upon the news that her daughter Mary Haines (Norma Shearer) has lost her husbands affections  to a perfume salesgirl in the man-eating mould of Joan Crawford, no less. Mas advice is as seasoned as her unblinking reaction: Mary should hold her tongue, not only if she wants her man back (and rest assured he hasnt tired of her, only himself), but because her girlfriends will never hold theirs. Im an old woman, my dear  I know my sex.</p><p>Cukor is often credited with a similar feminine sensibility, but on this high-register farce the slant was inescapable: adapted by Gentlemen Prefer Blondes Anita Loos and Jane Murfin from Clare Boothes stage play, it featured what the publicity notes claimed was a cast of 135 women  Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard and Joan Fontaine among them  versus no men. (Even the animals were billed as all-female.) But its no proto-feminist declaration: from the make-up counter to the divorce train to Reno, men are either common cause or bones of contention. The tone ranges from flappy catfights to lusty intrigue to sweet mother-daughter confidences; Cukor at one point bursts the black and white with a dreamily commercial Technicolor fashion-show (this was 1939, when hed just been replaced on Gone with the Wind by The Wizard of Ozs Victor Fleming), but otherwise inscribes the film with his usual subtle sophistication, typically putting the element of performance centre-stage. A more eccentric film than the following years The Philadelphia Story, with which it shares a couple of faces, its almost as fabulous.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
A stark, solid, impressively stylish film, overshadowed (a little unfairly) by the later explosion of Whale's wit in the delirious <i>Bride of Frankenstein</i>. Karloff gives one of the great performances of all time as the monster whose mutation from candour to chill savagery is mirrored only through his limpid eyes. The film's great imaginative coup is to show the monster 'growing up' in all too human terms. First he is the innocent baby, reaching up to grasp the sunlight that filters through the skylight. Then the joyous child, playing at throwing flowers into the lake with a little girl whom he delightedly imagines to be another flower. And finally, as he finds himself progressively misjudged by the society that created him, the savage killer as whom he has been typecast. The film is unique in Whale's work in that the horror is played absolutely straight, and it has a weird fairytale beauty not matched until Cocteau made <i>La Belle et la Bte. </i>TM.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[You can just about read, scrawled on the wall of a shed in this buoyant and funny British film from 1969, Barny (sic) is a big prick, which gives you some idea of the sort of kids young director Barney Platts-Mills was working with when he filmed this story of teenage love and alienation on the streets of the old East End. Bronco Bullfrog (Sam Shepherd) is a lonely wide boy fresh out of borstal, but the films anti-hero is Del (Del Walker), a young welder who starts doing jobs with Bronco at the same time as dating nervous 15-year-old Irene (Anne Gooding) against the wishes of her sourpuss mum. All this change sends Del into a headspin: whats a boy to do with his life? None of the actors were professional (although some came from Joan Littlewoods Theatre Workshop), and theres a lovely naturalism to the chat and romance, even if some scenes come across as a bit shaky. Most strikingly, and unlike other better-known realist films of the time, theres nothing precious about its attitude to the working class: the spirit of its actors runs right through it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The sound of wedding bells threatens to split asunder four African-American buddies in this serio-comic survey of modern manhood. When exec Terry (Moore) announces his nuptials, his friends are unimpressed: teacher Derrick (Hughley) is dead against it since he got hitched too young, and eligible pediatrician Jackson (Chestnut) reckons there's still time to play the field, like lawyer Brian (Bellamy). Subsequent events conspire to alter their opinions, however, since Jackson in particular is about to face character-building woman trouble, when he meets sassy photographer Denise (Union). Writer/director Hardwick's debut is a patchy assemblage of soap opera devices, often hilarious incidental dialogue, and an occasionally trenchant look at blinkered machismo. Although aspirational upper income-bracket settings help smooth over the joins, the film's inconsistency is exasperating.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A genuinely collaborative movie, aiming to deal with the state of the West German nation in the months between the Schleyer kidnapping and the Baader-Meinhof deaths in Stammheim Prison. The result centres on paranoia rather than on terrorism as such. Fassbinder brings the issues squarely back home, showing himself arguing with his mother and taking out his aggressions on his late boyfriend Armin. At its best, the film argues that it's impossible to have a 'coherent' left wing position on terrorism.]]></review>

She also hopes to find a dream lover, but receives only the unwelcome attentions of pushy predators, until... There's a whiff of fairytale to this particular slice of realism  la Rohmer, but what's perhaps most remarkable is that the film was almost completely improvised; though not so as you'd know it. It's as flawlessly constructed, shot and performed as ever, with France's greatest living director effortlessly evoking the morose moods of holidaying alone among crowds, and revelling in the particulars of place, weather and time of day. Deceptively simple, the film oozes honesty and spontaneity; the word, quite bluntly, is masterpiece.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A Western of stark, classical lineaments: Cooper, still mysteriously beautiful in ravaged middle-age, plays a small town marshal who lays life and wife on the line to confront a killer set free by liberal abolitionists from the North. Waiting for the murderer's arrival on the midday train, he enters a long and desolate night of the soul as the heat gathers, his fellow-citizens scatter, and it grows dark, dark, dark amid the blaze of noon. Writer Carl Foreman, who fetched up on the HUAC blacklist, leaves it open whether the marshal is making a gesture of sublime, arrogant futility - as his bride (Kelly), a Quaker opposed to violence, believes - or simply doing what a man must. High Noon won a fistful of Oscars, but in these days of pasteboard screen machismo, it's worth seeing simply as the anatomy of what it took to make a man before the myth turned sour.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Lang's first sound film was based on the real-life manhunt for the Dsseldorf child-murderer (an extraordinary performance by Peter Lorre). A radical, analytical film that entertains many of Lang's fascinations: innovative use of sound; the detail of police procedure; the parallels drawn between organised police behaviour and the underworld... a construction which carries Lang's own view of the arbitrariness of the Law. A subversive film, or more simply a movie brimming over with the ferment of Lang's imagination at its height? You choose.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When an atomic scientist (Jones) entertains serious doubts about his work and promises to blow up London unless the government rids Britain of nuclear weapons, rumours of war spread, panic grows, and the suspense is killing. Still relevant and surprisingly powerful, <i>Seven Days to Noon</i> impresses by its ambiguity: while we sympathise with the ordinary Londoners menaced by the professor's drastic policy, and are told by politicians and boffins that he is mad from overwork, what we see is an intelligent, sane man of intense, apolitical commitment. London, both in the grip of evacuation and deserted, is beautifully evoked by the <i>noir</i>-ish camerawork, and John Addison's Herrmannesque score helps to keep the atmosphere nervy. Only the cosy Cockney cameos (all pluck and chatter) deflate the otherwise carefully sustained paranoia.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Kurosawa's masterpiece, testifying to his admiration for John Ford and translated effortlessly back into the form of a Western as <i>The Magnificent Seven</i>, has six masterless samurai - plus Mifune, the crazy farmer's boy not qualified to join the elect group, who nevertheless follows like a dog and fights like a lion - agreeing for no pay, just food and the joy of fulfilling their duty as fighters, to protect a helpless village against a ferocious gang of bandits. Despite the caricatured acting forms of Noh and Kabuki which Kurosawa adopted in his period films, the individual characterisations are precise and memorable, none more so than that by Takashi Shimura, one of the director's favourite actors, playing the sage, ageing, and oddly charismatic samurai leader. The epic action scenes involving cavalry and samurai are still without peer.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An early encounter between Kurosawa and two of his favourite actors, Mifune and Shimura, both playing detectives in Japan's uneasy postwar period under US imperialism. When Mifune's pistol is stolen, he is overwhelmed by a feeling of dishonour rather than failure, and sets out on a descent into the lower depths of Tokyo's underworld, which gradually reveals Dostoievskian parallels between himself and his quarry. A sweltering summer is at its height, and Kurosawa's strenuous location shooting transforms the city into a sensuous collage of fluttering fans and delicate, sweating limbs. A fine blend of US thriller material with Japanese conventions, it's a small classic. CPea.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Very early Kurosawa (although it wasn't released in Japan until 1952 because of the US censor's sensitivity about 'feudal' subjects) and in no sense a major work. Based on a traditional story that exists in both Noh and Kabuki stage versions, and Kurosawa makes use of elements from both. A young nobleman has to cross a checkpoint in his flight from a vengeful brother, and impersonates a porter to do so; one of his juniors has to beat him to make the deception more convincing, but thereby violates one of the prime tenets of the feudal code... Kurosawa's chief contribution to the project was to add a second, comic porter to the plot.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For better or worse, Francis Ford Coppolas Tetro feels like a movie unsullied by boardroom manipulation or test-screening fallout. Its the first picture hes written since The Conversation in 1974 and it feels like a glimmering relic from his New Hollywood heyday. Some may see it as splicing the artistic fretfulness of Fellini with the poised opulence of Almodvar, but in fact this is 100 per cent pure Coppola. Accept no substitutes.<br />Vincent Gallo lends his suitably spikey presence to the title character, Tetro, a hobbling, boho literary genius in exile. Holed up in Buenos Aires with doting partner Miranda (Maribel Verd), he works as the lighting operator for a saucy tinpot burlesque show while trying to escape the Freudian nightmare of his upbringing. A visitation from his baleful younger brother Benny (newcomer Alden Ehrenreich  solid, if hardly a revelation) forces Tetro to attend to his severely knotted family ties as well as make a decision about what to do with the unfinished book thats lurking on top of the wardrobe.<br />Tetro is a movie filled with splashes of brilliance rather than being a plain brilliant movie. Visually, its a joy to behold, with every monochrome frame (with the odd colour segment thrown in) arranged and lit with the eye of an old master. As a story, though, it doesnt deliver the goods. A neatly illusive build-up segues regretfully into a series of soap-opera-like twists that appear to be entirely at the service of Coppolas own grandiose philosophical intimations, which mainly regards the personal gains to be made from art and family. An imperfect gem, then, but a keeper for sure.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Despite vetoing its original title, A Couple of Dicks, the studio gave Clerks director Kevin Smith a free rein on this pitifully unfunny hommage to 80s action comedies. Sadly, his Brooklyn buddy cops are not so much mis matched as miscast: comedian Tracy Morgans (right) tiresome shtick as Bruce Williss long-time, loose-cannon partner is more suited to the cheeky sidekick character he should be playing, while Williss role as the grumpy stooge wastes his talent for snappy dialogue delivery. Not that theres any quick-fire humour to be had from Robb and Mark Cullens lacklustre script; or much in the way of gunfire either. The tedious plot concerns the theft by a memorabilia-obsessed Mexican drug dealer Poh Boy (Guillermo Diaz) of Williss rare, valuable baseball card, which the cop needs to sell to pay for his daughters wedding. To add insult to injury, Smith lured the composer of the Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack, Harold Faltermeyer, out of retirement to write the electronic score for this puerile slapstick crap.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Six years before a Hollywood screenwriters
corpse narrated Sunset Blvd, a dead-man-walking delivered the hard-boiled
voiceover in another Billy Wilder inquiry into moral rot in sunny California.
Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), a salesman for Pacific All-Risk Insurance,
staggers into the office late one night to record a memorandum regarding the
recent death of a policyholder: I killed Dietrichson for money, and a woman.
I didnt get the money, and I didnt get the woman.<br />Theres nothing but a towel and a staircase
between Neff and the woman when they first meet; Neff pays a house call on
Dietrichsons Spanish-revival pile in LA, where old dust levitates in the bands
of light through the Venetian blinds, and he encounters the oil executives
bored, platinum-blonde second wife, Phyllis (Barbara Stanwyck). Shed like to
know if she can secretly procure a life insurance policy for her spouse; Neff
knows shes conscripting him for her husband-disposal unit, and he knows that
claims manager Barton Keyes (Edward G Robinson) will smell a putrefying rat,
but theyve got power-surge chemistry, and thats a honey of an anklet shes
wearing<br />As poised and
languorous as a cat, Stanwycks definitive femme fatale could be one of the
savvy minxes of the actress delectable Pre-Code years  the jailhouse alpha
female in Ladies They Talk About, the secretary trampolining up the office
ranks one bed at a time in Baby Face  grown older and harder, her manicured
ruthlessness calcifying into brutal amorality. With diamond-hard repartee by
Wilder and Raymond Chandler (by way of James M Cains novel) and ghoulish
cinematography by the great John Seitz, this is the gold standard of 40s noir,
straight down the line.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Tati's first film in colour. Yes, his contrast of the glorious awfulness of the Arpels' automated Modernistic house with Hulot's disordered Bohemianism is simplistic. Yes, Hulot as champion of the individual is oddly de-personalised. And one might even conclude that Tati is a closet misanthrope. Such text-book reservations come and go as this extraordinary film meanders like the Arpels' concrete garden path. But while some episodes are protracted, many are unforgettably funny, wonderfully observed, and always technically brilliant. Insane gadgets slam and roar, high heels click like metronomes, and even a depressed dachshund in a tartan overcoat obligingly submits to Tati's meticulous direction.]]></review>

Degree of difficulty apart - and difficulty involved making an entire farmyard of real animals talk - the merits of <i>Babe </i>are those of Dick King-Smith's classic, <i>The Sheep-Pig</i>. Piglet Babe beats the slaughterhouse and is adopted by a sheepdog who coaches him in the art of rounding up sheep. Taciturn farmer Hoggett (Cromwell) wonderingly goes along with this apprenticeship, and is gratified when Babe wins the rosette at the trials. Babe's secret is politeness which gets better results than barking, and raises lots of laughs. Charming, eccentric and very amusing.]]></review>

The narrator's a critic, the cop a would-be necrophiliac, and the femme fatale a faceless corpse... or are they? Less investigative thriller than an investigation of that genre's conventions - voyeurism (looking at, and for, Laura), a search for solutions (not just whodunit but whodunwhat), and the race against time (clues and clocks, fantasies and flashbacks) - the plot is deliberately perfunctory, the people deliciously perverse, and the <i>mise-en-scne</i> radical.

      <review><![CDATA[A girl on the cusp of adolescence is inducted into a threatening fantasy world where she discovers her own power. Its a familiar, even archetypal story well suited to the dreamlike parallel reality of cinema: Alice, Wendy and Dorothy found their ways on screen and have been joined by the young heroines of Labyrinth, Spirited Away and Mirrormask, to name just a few. Pans Labyrinth is another version of the tale, but an unusual one in that it isnt suitable for children. Not only is it replete with violence visited on the body, but its lessons  in the inadequacy of fantasy as a countermeasure to repression  might have sensitive youngsters chucking in the towel.<br />As in The Devils Backbone and a prospective new project, 3993, del Toro (who is Mexican) arranges his supernatural drama against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War. The setting is 1944, so the conflict proper is over, but skirmishes continue between anti-fascist guerrillas and forces under the command of sadistic, narcissistic Captain Vidal (Sergi Lpez)  or father, as young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is instructed to address him when she arrives at his forest base with her pregnant, ailing mother (Ariadna Gil), Vidals new bride. The maid, Mercedes (Maribel Verd), is friendly and in some ways a mirror character for Ofelia, but the girl is basically alone  until a large cricket transforms into a fairy and leads her to a crumbling stone maze in the grounds, where an ageing faun greets her as a lost princess, pending her completion of certain tasks<br />Its no coincidence that the fairy appears after the double-killing that establishes this fable isnt kids stuff, or that the jeopardy of Ofelias challenges pales in comparison to real-world struggles. Reality increasingly dominates the story; in fact, the fauns realm can seem merely the stage for a series of set-pieces whose grotesque and detailed design impresses more than any sense of momentum or high stakes.<br />Yet as escapist fantasies go, this supernature is markedly muddy  both literally, as when Ofelia ventures into the belly of a great tree, and in the general creepiness that marks even those ostensibly sympathetic to her, like the faun, with its unnerving habit of appearing in her bedroom. The labyrinth has echoes of authentic atrocity: a pile of childrens shoes lies ominously near the banqueting table of a bald-bodied, blank-faced baby-eater. At least as evident, though, is del Toros own immersion in fantasy and horror cinema, with nods to Dont Look Now, Rosemarys Baby and The Shining among others (not to mention Goya and The Spirit of the Beehive). Its as a filmmaker, rather than storyteller, that del Toro is most successful here: a disjunction remains between the storys childlike form and its gruesome execution, but few directors are so adept at conveying both the uncanny in the real and the recognisable in the fantastic.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[As petty criminal Sailor (Cage) and his lover Lula (Dern) go on the run through a murderous Deep South, fleeing but meeting sleazy oddballs hired by Lula's mom (Ladd) to end their relationship, Lynch evokes a surreal, sinister world a mite too reminiscent of his earlier work: bloody murder, violent sexual passion, kooky kitsch, freaky characters immersed in private fantasies, digressive metaphors, symbols and cultish references, and bizarre humour to lighten the nightmare. This <i>dj vu</i> weakens the film; sometimes the weirdness seems so forced that Lynch appears merely to be giving fans what they expect. But it's churlish to focus on flaws when so much is exhilaratingly unsettling. Even more than a virtuoso shoot-out, two scenes - Stanton tortured by a gang of grotesques, a truly nasty car crash - exemplify Lynch's ability to disturb through carefully contrived atmosphere; while the performances lend a consistency of tone lacking in the narrative (but ever-present in Fred Elmes' fine camerawork). The film, finally, is funny, scary and brilliantly cinematic.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The most bizarre movie in both Vidor's and Cooper's filmographies, this adaptation of Ayn Rand's first novel mutes Ms Rand's neo-Nietzschean philosophy of 'Objectivism' but lays on the expressionist symbolism with a 'free enterprise' trowel. Cooper plays the up-and-coming architect with unorthodox ideas who dynamites a building that doesn't conform with his plans, marries wealthy heiress Neal, and winds up building the world's tallest tombstone as a memorial to a friend who committed suicide. As berserk as it sounds, although handsomely shot by Robert Burks and directed with enthusiasm.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Sweeping strings accompany the opening sequence of balletic whales cavorting in brilliant blue sea, changing abruptly to a cacophony as the bad guys with nets chug up in their tugs. Willy is trapped and his family swims mournfully away. Cut to an angelic street-kid, Jesse (Richter), caught graffiti-ing Willy's tank; the only way to escape 'baby jail' he discovers is to go to well-meaning but stiffo foster parents and clean up the tank under the tutelage of Haida Indian whale-trainer Randolph (Schellenberg). Willy, meanwhile, has turned ornery. Soon, however, Jesse's mouth organ is echoing Willy's whalesong and the message is spelt out: boy and whale get on because they're both looking for a family. This well-acted film has a straight-faced tone which is hard to resist.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[At times a little too hyperkinetic and punchy for its own good, this account of the spread of drug-fuelled crime into Rio's <i>favelas</i> from the '60s to the '80s is nevertheless an impressive affair. Centred on a kid keen to keep his nose clean and become a photographer, despite the live-fast-die-young tendencies of those around him, the film blends superb location photography, a pacy but nicely elastic editing style, an ingenious, imaginative approach to narrative, and expertly choreographed action to document the way petty crime and petty rivalries spiral out of control to plunge the neighborhood into murderous gang wars. And the performances, many from non-pros, are terrific.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Eight years after its Australian debut, <i>Stone</i> was wheeled onto the British circuits by distributors clearly chasing the audience that made the <i>Mad Max</i> cycle so successful. But any comparison with those films - or its true American ancestor <i>Wild Angels</i> - reveals that this is strictly a moped of a movie. To be fair, L plates are on display: it's a first feature for director Harbutt, who also produced, co-stars, and co-scripted. Stone himself (Shorter) is an undercover cop who infiltrates a gang of bikers known as The Undertakers (they bury their dead standing up 'so they won't have to take anything lying down'). His cover eloquently blown - 'This cat's a pig, man' - Stone ingratiates himself by riding a mean machine. Much footage of bikers abusing less than picturesque locals - cadging ciggies, stealing sauce-bottles, and so on - follows until suddenly it's all over. Like its hero's 'Levi originals', <i>Stone</i> badly needs the piss taken out of it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Why did the fans turn late-nite screenings of this cult favourite into an elaborate ritual of dressing-up, singing along, throwing rice and waving cigarette lighters? Well, for one thing, the material inspires affection, given its knowing pastiche of everything from Universal horrors to '50s grade-Z sci-fi, and a shamelessly hedonistic, fiercely independent sensibility that must have seemed a welcome relief from the mainstream bombast of other '70s musicals (not exactly <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i>, is it?). However, dare we suggest that the whole participation angle evolved to boost a movie that is something of an enthusiastic shambles, and collapses altogether in the final reel? Fresh-faced Sarandon and Bostwick are the all-American honeymooners who wind up in the tender care of Tim Curry's camper-than-thou Transylvanian transvestite, O'Brien's hunchback butler and sundry kinky cronies. A string of hummable songs gives it momentum, Gray's admirably straight-faced narrator holds it together, and a run on black lingerie takes care of almost everything else.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Comedy]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[Wittier, a lot more enjoyable and infinitely richer  than the year's major Oscar contenders, this is clearly a blood brother to Anderson's <i>Rushmore</i>. The Tenenbaums are New York high society gone to seed. Scandalous Royal (Hackman) separated from wife Etheline (Huston) two decades ago, and after that kept his distance as his once prodigious offspring slumped. Business whizz Chas (Stiller) has become a paranoid neurotic; Richie (Wilson) is a tennis star whose career was sacrificed to love; adopted daughter Margot (Paltrow) is a closed book of a playwright. Financially embarrassed and claiming a dying man's last rights, Royal returns to put his house in order. The milieu is reminiscent of Preston Sturges' screwball fancies from the early 1940s - albeit scored to '70s rock. Anderson's unusually pronounced literary influences include Salinger, Edith Wharton and the <i>New Yorker</i> magazine, and the film sometimes resembles a cartoon from that august publication's glory days: an elegantly composed caricature given the finishing touch with an immaculately turned one-liner. It exists in a bubble - Anderson's New York doesn't exist and never did - but the rarefied atmosphere is a bit of a blind; what sneaks up on you is how, in his deliciously roundabout way, Anderson wears irony on his sleeve to camouflage a deeper sincerity. At its heart, this is a comedy of unrequited love, melancholy and disappointment. One to savour.]]></review>

The ersatz Parisian atmosphere, circa 1910, is a wonder. Maurice Chevalier may have made the theme song familiar, but the voice cast boasts a fine array of ex-pats: spinster cat-lover Mme Bonfamille is Hermione Baddeley; the conniving butler - the cad who casts her cats into the countryside to inherit her wealth - is Roddy Maude-Roxby; her beloved cat Duchess the seductive Eva Gabor. As Scatman Crothers has it: 'Everybody's picking up the feline beat, 'cos everything else is ob-so-lete!' Purr-fect.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
The most peculiar entry, or perhaps just the laziest, in David Thomsons New Biographical Dictionary of Film is for Wes Anderson, and reads in full: Watch this space. What does that mean? That he might be something one day. Anderson partisans may safely argue that the 35-year-old is quite something already: an endearingly fussy craftsman of droll, melancholy comedies that dissect the vicissitudes of friendship and family ties, unfolding within hermetic Cornell-box worlds of vintage pop and meticulously nostalgic art design. Alas, Andersons fourth feature (the product of a hard winters shoot in Italy) may do little to correct Thomsons irresolution. Despite its typically painstaking attentions to elaborate set dressings and assignations of quirk, The Life Aquatic meanders and stalls in its journeys with ocean explorer Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), a down-at-heel Cousteau-manqu pursuing a filmed revenge mission against the jaguar shark who devoured his best friend.<br />Suffused with lush yet faded primary colours like a 30-year-old Kodak snap and spiced with Henry Selicks stop-motion animations and a starry (if often idle) cast of supporting players, The Life Aquatic is a beautifully appointed but airless dollhouse-by-the-sea, populated by wistful figurines in their matching little red caps and Team Zissou Adidas, and scored to Seu Jorges deckside acoustic renditions of Bowie songs in Portuguese. The movie pokes along in a manner at once listless and affable, like a series of semi-improvised outtakes that didnt quite gel. And yet the director magically conjures emotional dividends in the films invigorating last moments, which wordlessly celebrate an underrated and truly Andersonian virtue: solidarity.

      <review><![CDATA[The Dark Knight returns in Christopher Nolan's 're-imagining' of the comic book 
legend, and the result is one of the most stunning superhero films yet made, a 
Batman film quite unlike any that have gone before.<br />Where Tim Burton gave 
us gothic-bat and Joel Schumacher gave us camp-bat, Nolan concentrates on making 
his Caped Crusader real, so much so that were the superhero element removed, the 
substantial leftovers would make a gripping drama about guilt, loss, vengeance 
and redemption. <br />Taking their inspiration from the dark graphic novels on 
the 1990s (most notably 'Arkham Asylum' 
and 'Batman: Year One') Nolan and 
co-writer David Goyer have crafted a fantastic story bathed in wonder, horror, 
mystery and spectacle.<br />The first hour is all carefully constructed 
back-story, establishing young Bruce Wayne's fear of bats and his guilt at the 
death of his parents.<br />We then follow this troubled soul on into manhood, 
where an eventful trip to Bhutan helps Wayne come to terms with this fear and 
grief and paves the way for his transformation into the winged wonder.<br />At 
this point the script carefully and logically explains the introduction of the 
suit, the toys, the cave and the car, allowing us to genuinely believe in the 
birth of the bat and perfectly setting up the stunning action and drama of the 
second half.<br />In the lead role, Christian Bale excels as the 
psychologically damaged millionaire playboy, managing to be utterly charming, 
wholly disarming and unquestionably dangerous all at once.<br />His job is 
made easier by the note-perfect cast that Nolan has assembled around him 
however.<br />As the various shady characters that populate Gotham's 
underworld, Tom Wilkinson, Cillian Murphy, Rutger Hauer and especially Liam 
Neeson excel, while Gary Oldman imbues Jim Gordon (who hasn't made Commissioner 
yet) with a pathos and honesty that sets him apart from the previous caricatures 
of the role.<br />Morgan Freeman is also excellent as technological wizard 
Lucius Fox, and once you've seen Michael Caine's wonderful turn as Alfred, 
Wayne's loyal and trusted butler, youll wonder why any other actor was ever 
previously cast in the role.<br />But Batman isn't just about the characters, 
and the director clearly knows that, carefully constructing a believable world 
for the forces of good and evil to inhabit.<br />Not for Nolan the gothic 
wonderland of Burton's films, or the neon-lit hell of Schumacher's  his 
visually stunning Gotham City is a world unto itself, where crime is rife, 
corruption flourishes and bad things happen to good people on an all too regular 
basis. <br />And as the villains, including the demonic Scarecrow and the 
dastardly Ra's al Ghul, start to prosper, so proceedings become increasingly 
horrific, making 'Batman Begins' an 
unexpectedly intense and disturbing affair.<br />Nevertheless, in spite of 
these sporadic flashes of terror (and parents would be advised to cover their 
children's eyes whenever the Scarecrow's gas is in use) Nolan never dwells on 
the gruesome, and before long we're returned to the heart of the 
action.<br />It is here that 'Batman 
Begins' hits its only bum note however, the close-up, high-impact fight 
sequences proving hard to follow, so much so that at times you wish that the 
director would pull back a little so that you can see what the hell is going 
on.<br />But that's a minor quibble in what is an otherwise outstanding 
reinvention of one of the 20th century's most enduring legends.<br />A comic 
book adaptation that doesn't patronise or pander to the subject matter and isn't 
afraid to take itself seriously, 'Batman 
Begins' respects the source material, develops it in inspired and 
unexpected ways and elevates it to a seriously sophisticated cinematic 
level.<br />An unadulterated joy from start to finish, it's rumoured to be the 
first of a proposed trilogy from Nolan and Goyer, and if that turns out be true, 
the Dark Knight can't return soon enough.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hitman Julian Noble (Pierce Brosnan) has been killing people for too long; though expert and amoral enough to get hired for corporate jobs aplenty, hes now finding it harder to pull the trigger. Hes lonely, too, despite having sex (paid-for or otherwise) almost whenever he wants. So late one night, birthday-drunk in a ritzy Mexico City hotel, hes drawn into unlikely conversation with strait-laced Denver businessman Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), whose main worry is staying in work so that his beloved wife Bean (Hope Davis) doesnt leave him. At first Danny disbelieves Julians claims regarding his profession  until a live demonstration at the corrida reveals the thrill of living (and taking life) dangerously. In short, a few margaritas with Julian has turned Danny and Beans humdrum existence upside down<br />Despite a decidedly wayward accent, Brosnans irreverent charm makes this a welcome alternative to Bond nonsense, even if its insufficient to compensate for dreary Kinnear, the less than dazzling Davis, and the movies moral stance (if such hollow posturing merits that term); somehow the film contrives to be at once offensively callous about murder victims and ludicrously timid in its desperation to retain sympathy for the three leads. This have-your-cake-and-eat-it attitude extends to a bullfight, Julians preference for margaritas and cock, and virtually everything else. The films fast, has some neat lines (I look like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday morning after the navy left town), but its outrageousness is facile; as black comedy its not so much subversive as frustratingly evasive.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its that old story of boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, girl falls for another boy, girl has illicit sexual relationship with other boy, original boy finds out and goes berserk, girl is then forced to choose between her heart, head and groin. Thats Andreas Dresens poignant, lightly philosophical and beautifully performed Cloud 9 in a nutshell, though it should be noted that all the boys and girl are of pensionable age. And while the intricate sex lives of elderly, working-class German suburbanites may not get box-office bells ringing, theres as much moral intrigue, erotic tension and heart-wrenching passion here as in any cheap romance populated by lithe, hormonal teenagers.<br /><br />Ursula Werner plays Inge, a prudent, sixtysomething <i>hausfrau</i> living in a dreary flat with her train-fancying partner of 30 years, Werner (Horst Rehberg). The spark of their relationship has definitely expired, which is why Inge has been secretly bedding down with Karl, a sunnier local man ten years her senior. Though its Inges choices that are central to the film, the emotions of all three are dealt with in depth. Yet Inges journey from guilt-free bed-hopping to shattering existential meltdown does take precedence. This film about the resilience and adaptability of the human body will inevitably draw comparisons between this and Fassbinders harrowing Fear Eats the Soul. But where that film explored the social context of an amour fou, Cloud 9 tells of an enclosed tragedy, one in which human contact is scarce and older people are expected to shuffle gracefully, sensibly and sexlessly to the grave.]]></review>

Once on safe ground, Soraya act as our eyes and ears in Palestine, although youd have to be blind and deaf to the situation to find any of her observations fresh or surprising. <br />In a piece of symmetry more written than real, she forms a friendship with a Palestinian man (Bakri) whos as keen to leave Palestine as she is to stay. Most incredibly, the narrative gets bogged down in Sorayas desire to recover her familys meagre pre-1948 assets from the local bank  the inspiration for a ridiculous plot turn that sinks the film.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of the most successful and prolific independent artists in modern American film, playwright-turned-director Tyler Perry has spent the past decade persuading audiences that African-Americans can be just as smug, shallow and bourgeois as their white brethren. Why Did I Get Married Too? follows four troubled couples on a Bahamian getaway, where the men drink beer and talk about sex while their wives get massages and talk about love. Perrys directorial style is soapy and bland, his writing shallow and predictable. But theres still fun to be had: a scene where Janet Jackson trashes her apartment with a golf club heightens the melodramatic intensity, while a last-minute celebrity cameo raises a smile. And as recriminations give way to tearful bouts of learning, hugging and growing, it becomes clear why Oprah is such a huge Perry fan.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[What with his writing, TV presenting and movie acting, one might argue that Danny Dyer has  like Peter Ustinov before him  become the counter-cultural media polymath of the age. He restlessly churns out content, but when it comes to film his name is fast becoming a byword for the unutterably dreadful. And so to Pimp, a cack-handed and joyless trawl through the grotty dives of Soho following a chaotic week in the life of scallywag sex trafficker Woody (played by writer/director, Robert Cavanah). Offering a tired rehash of his stock wideboy persona, Dyer plays crimelord Stanley who employs Woody as muscle for his ongoing turfwar against local rivals the Chinks. With its excessive levels of casual racism, sexism and homophobia, the film feels like nothing more than a rejected Derek and Clive sketch thats been stripped of eloquence and irony and calibrated instead for cheap, leery laughs. The attempts, too, at a faux-documentary style are badly botched, partly because the cast is visibly trying too hard to act naturally but mainly because of a script thats little more than a contrived patchwork of clichs, spurious historical quotations and so much swearing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA['Theyre just one of those bands who have a deep reservoir of rocket sauce,' says Jack Black, attempting to account for the queer phenomenon of Canadian geek-prog-metal-pop sensations Rush, who are duly treated to the protracted hagiography treatment by veteran rock-doc directors Dunn and McFadyen. As robust, well-paced career surveys go, this at least manages to offer appeal beyond the bands hardened fanbase, which on this evidence includes much of the cognoscenti of US heavy rock who are all on hand to offer their sycophantic two cents. That the band spent much of the 1970s being ridiculed for their bloated concept albums (with lyrics quoting Ayn Rand) is now a key part of their enduring mythology, and the function of the film is not only to rescue them from the dark corners of cultdom but to make people realise that  now more than ever  playing your copy of 'Hemispheres' at neighbour-bothering levels is something to be proud of.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[So its come to this. From Indiana Jones to the maverick scientist in a glorified disease-of-the-week movie, Harrison Ford may well be easing towards career twilight. Luxury casting is primarily what differentiates this true-life drama from afternoon-TV filler, but, to be fair, the real-life Crowley family have a remarkable story to tell. <br />A sales exec for a pharmaceuticals giant, John Crowley (Brendan Fraser) is married with three kids, and would be living the all-American success story except that his two youngest suffer from a rare neuromuscular syndrome called Pompes disease, which gravely curtails their life expectancy. Refusing to sit and watch his kids die, he seeks out medical opinion in the hope of developing a treatment: in actuality, various people were involved, but the film reduces it to Fords surly individualist Dr Robert Stonehill, whose theoretical discoveries lead the field, but remain untested.<br />Scottish director Tom Vaughans approach extracts the obvious emotional impact from plucky but seemingly doomed kids and their frantic parents without ever overdoing it, and the same goes for the cast, who do the necessary but keep it relatively tasteful. Stolid competence reigns throughout, though as a chronicle of against-the-odds medical endeavour, the whole thing proves slightly superficial and dramatically rather less arresting than, say, Lorenzos Oil. <br />What does emerge, however, is a useful chronicle of the process of getting any medicine from lab to patient, a process powered by the profit motive, of course. So, the story pits a fathers desperation against the clinical objectivity of the corporate pharmaceuticals industry (Jared Harris is excellent as a stern-hearted suit), though, perhaps surprisingly, never quite bows to sentimental gush in its assessment of the close relationship between big money and progress. Moderately illuminating in parts, but the clichs of cinematic suffering tend to overwhelm it. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Just in case you miss the point that one's betters are scum, Radford's version of the James Fox book opens on the decadent rich drinking champers in a London underground shelter during an air-raid. They took the party to Kenya, where one adultery too many led to the shooting of Josslyn Hay, twenty-second Earl of Erroll. Since we are never in much doubt that murder is inevitable, know the murderer's identity, and have no sympathy for any of the Happy Valley set, all that's on offer are hopefully scandalous tableaux of rude goings-on. Diana (Scacchi) hooks rich old Sir Jock (Ackland), but falls for the rogering Earl (Dance). Sir Jock bumps him off, gets acquitted, but tops himself anyway. So much for the story. On the sociological side, there's wife-swapping, Trevor Howard peering through a peephole at Scacchi in the bath, lots of drugs and drink, transvestite parties, Sarah Miles smearing her vaginal secretions on the lips of her dead lover in the morgue, and roomy shorts. Irising out on a cocktail party in a cemetery, we say farewell or toodle-pip to the most stunningly boring crew this side of the Ralph Reader show.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The UK Film Council and BBC 2s celebration of British film continues with a big-screen showing of Michael Andersons 1955 WWII matine mainstay about the RAFs efforts to destroy three key Ruhr Valley dams using eccentric aircraft designer Barnes Walliss bizarre bouncing bombs. The first half of this stiff upper-lipper centres on Wallis initial frustration in the face of bureaucratic apathy and the eventual official go-ahead and final preparation stages, before the action is ramped up for the mission itself.</p><p>Seeing it again after so many decades, one cant help but notice the by-numbers structural simplicity of the film, the use of Queens English throughout, and how the word nigger (in this case the codeword for one of the dams) could be bandied about with such jaw-dropping nonchalance. Its a film built on the eureka moment: you can just imagine audiences back then cheering the screen at the sight of the first dam blowing, and being wholly impressed by the hilariously elementary special effects. But its Eric Coates rousing militaristic signature tune that, in hindsight, has left the most lasting impression.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Perhaps Kubrick's most perfectly realised film, simply because his cynical vision of the progress of technology and human stupidity is wedded with comedy, in this case Terry Southern's sparkling script in which the world comes to an end thanks to a mad US general's paranoia about women and commies. Sellers' three roles are something of an indulgent showcase, though as the tight-lipped RAF officer and the US president he gives excellent performances. Better, however, are Scott as the gung-ho military man frustrated by political soft-pedalling, and - especially - Hayden as the beleaguered lunatic who presses the button. Kubrick wanted to have the antics end up with a custard-pie finale, but thank heavens he didn't; the result is scary, hilarious, and nightmarishly beautiful, far more effective in its portrait of insanity and call for disarmament than any number of worthy anti-nuke documentaries.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Kurosawa quotes this, his seventh feature, an atmospheric <i>noir</i>-inflected low life melodrama, as the first in which he felt truly himself as director. Casting the moody 28-year-old Mifune, in the first of their 16 collaborations, as the violent gangster whom boozy doctor Shimura diagnoses as suffering from TB ('a hole in the heart,' says the sour 'angel', ruefully), entailed major rewrites as his part was gradually increased. The movie breathes the polluted air of post-war pessimism, dissipation and poetic fatalism, symbolised in the shots of the oily, malaria-ridden swamp of a Tokyo dockside, but it is dramatically qualified by Mifune's suggested redeemability and Shimura's stoical humanism, the quality he epitomised almost 20 years later in the marvellous <i>Redbeard</i>. Fascinating, highly enjoyable and filled with great scenes - not least the slippery battle to the death in a paint-filled corridor.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It might be more interesting to watch this Tarantino/Rodriguez film without knowing what's in store, in which case, skip this review and take your chances. But don't come running back to me if double-barrelled schizophrenic gun-crazy gut-shot evangelical sleaze, incendiary, popcorn-blowing macho mayhem, slinky, soul-searching zombie strippers, and vampiric cult-infested cinemania don't light your pipe. Tarantino and Clooney are the Gecko brothers, sick and ruthless killers, respectively. They commandeer the motor home of the Rev Fuller (Keitel) to evade the cops en route to a midnight rendezvous at the Titty Twister, hottest whorehouse in all Mexico. Along for the ride are Fuller's teen kids, and the Reverend himself, who has most definitely picked the wrong day to lose his faith. Written by Tarantino in 1990 on a commission from a special effects company, the film is aimed squarely at (male) horror movie fans who appreciate the nuances of impalement by pool cue, pencil and table leg. Rodriguez has a lot of fun dreaming up cool ways to kill people (he's making this his life's work), but he also gets something resembling a performance from Tarantino and transforms Clooney into a full-fledged movie star. Bikers, head-bangers and film geeks will rave to the grave.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Kurosawa's first venture for his own short-lived production company, a revenge tragedy (employee of big housing corporation marries the boss' daughter while simultaneously seeking the truth of his father's 'suicide') which attempts to indict the corruptions that go hand-in-hand with big business, ultimately hinting that even the government cannot be said to have clean hands. Freed from immediate box-office pressures, Kurosawa rather loaded the film on the side of social significance, while neglecting to capitalise on the <i>noir </i>aspects that underlie it. Even so, his use of the 'scope screen is masterly, suggesting right from the opening sequence - a wedding at which the cake is a replica of the company offices, and the crippled bride has obviously had a groom bought from among daddy's employees - a boardroom table across which manipulations gradually unfold. Exported in a 135-minute version.]]></review>

Competent, well acted and with some excellent aerial special effects, but flawed by mawkish sentimentality in orchestrating its nobility of self-sacrifice theme. Holden is the WWII pilot, now married and established in a civilian career, who resents being recalled to risk his life in a forgotten war; Rooney (sporting a non-regulation green silk topper) and Strauss are on hand to provide the other-ranks humour.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A twisted and often nasty black comedy. When naive suburbanite Broderick asks Carrey's over-eager Cable Guy to give him a few extra channels for free, he has no idea he's inviting the wired-up plugster into his life. Newly separated from his girlfriend, Broderick is sucked into his socially inept pal's deranged fantasy world, the result of a lonely boyhood spent watching TV. Carrey's whirlwind comic energy is too spontaneous and elusive to be contained by Lou Holtz Jr's initially unsettling script. Also, Stiller's erratic direction fails to establish a consistent tone, so that obvious, crowd pleasing set-pieces alternate with creepy, disturbing weirdness. Compare, for instance, Carrey's typically berserk karaoke rendition of Jefferson Airplane's 'Somebody to Love?' with the nightmarish sequence in a kitschy Arthurian theme restaurant, where he and Broderick quaff ale and gnaw chicken before fighting, virtually to the death, with swords, axes, maces and jousting lances. Nevertheless, because it dares to expose the dark side of Carrey's persona, and to take chances at this pivotal stage in his meteoric career, Stiller's film ranks as an honourable failure.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The hard-boiled private eye coolly strolls a few steps ahead of the audience. The slapstick detective gets everything wrong and then pratfalls first over the finish line anyway. Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is neither - instead he's a hard-boiled private eye who gets everything wrong. Jake snaps tabloid-ready photos of an adulterous love nest that's no such thing. He spies a distressed young woman through a window and mistakes her for a hostage. He finds bifocals in a pond and calls them Exhibit A of marital murder, only the glasses don't belong to the victim and the wife hasn't killed anyone. Yet when he confronts ostensible black widow Evelyn Mulwray (Dunaway) with the spectacular evidence, the cigarette between his teeth lends his voice an authoritative Bogie hiss. Throughout, Gittes sexes up mediocre snooping with blithe arrogance and sarcastic machismo. It's the actor's default mode, sure, but in 1974 it hadn't yet calcified into Schtickolson, and in 1974 a director (Polanski), a screenwriter (Towne) and a producer (Evans) could decide to beat a genre senseless and dump it in the wilds of Greek tragedy. 'You see, Mr <i>Gits</i>,' depravity incarnate Noah Cross (Huston) famously explains, 'most people never have to face the fact that, at the right time and the right place, they're capable of anything.' As is <i>Chinatown</i>. The last gunshot here is the sound of the gate slamming on the Paramount lot of Evans' halcyon reign, and as the camera rears back to catch Jake's expression, the dolly lists and shivers - an almost imperceptible sob of grief and recognition, but not a tear is shed.

      <review><![CDATA[The odd Sturges film out, a more or less serious biopic of WTG Morton, the Boston dentist who accidentally discovered the use of ether as an anaesthetic in 1846, receiving neither fame nor fortune as a reward for this great service to humanity. But Sturges couldn't be solemn for long, and though telling a basically tragic story (like the hero of <i>The Great McGinty</i>, Morton ruined himself through one 'great moment' of charitable impulse), he injects some delightful doses of slapstick and verbal fancy, while using members of his stock company in very unexpected ways. Recut by the studio and generally considered to be a failure, it's nevertheless an oddly moving film that sticks obstinately and agreeably in the mind.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Contract killer Martin Blank (John Cusack) finds himself going home to Grosse Pointe, Detroit, for his high school reunion weekend. His shrink (Arkin) thinks it might help with his spiritual crisis. So does his secretary (Joan Cusack). And besides, there's a job in town. More to the point, maybe Debi (Driver) is ready to forgive him, ten years after he stood her up on prom night. Coming on the heels of <i>Swingers</i> and <i>Palookaville</i>, this hip black comedy is another droll study in the neuroses of the modern American male. As his name suggests, Blank is a void - his life has no meaning - but he thinks he's smart enough to get back on track, to buck those twin truisms: you can't go home again, and there are no second acts in American lives. Cusack is an engaging, lively actor with a keen sense of irony, and those qualities are much in evidence here. Director Armitage doesn't quite get the edge he brought to <i>Miami Blues</i>, but for what is essentially a one-joke movie, this has an awful lot going for it; not least the persuasive notion that psychiatrists all over America are being terrorised by angst-ridden hitmen intent on liberating their inner selves.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Centred loosely on a New Jersey family of three grown-up sisters, their parents, partners and children, Solondz's brave and adventurous second feature takes misery, loneliness and cruelty as a given in contemporary life; everyone here is (justifiably or otherwise) unhappy with their lot - or should be, if they could only stop deluding themselves. Right from the painfully funny opening, it's a bible-black comedy of considerable assurance, but gradually the humour subsides to be replaced by a core of despairing human sympathy, most noticeably for the paedophile father whose heart-to-hearts with his teenage son come to form the emotional backbone of the movie. Very often, you're unsure whether you want to accompany Solondz on his journey into a modern purgatory, but you should take the trip; it's worth it, and something you'll never forget.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The movie of Nick Hornby's book has been transposed to Chicago, but with more fidelity than you might expect. Cusack, a wry and believably apathetic Rob, rakes over the ashes of dead relationships and casts a wary eye out for a mid-life crisis he's too lethargic to put himself through. Director Frears' big idea is to have Rob break off from scenes to recount dry monologues on sex and vinyl. He does this so often you wonder why he doesn't write a book and have done with it. Then you remember: the book's written, this is the movie. That's not a putdown, really. I enjoyed the film - twice! I related! Taylor, Gilbert, Gregson Wagner: chicks so cool they endow the uncredited Zeta-Jones with honorary coolness. Black's a dynamo, a bullshitter in a vinyl store. Dylan, The Beta Band, The Chemical Brothers - the soundtrack's packed, but you wish they'd let you hear more of it; you wish that Hornby wrote women as funny as his blokes; and you wish it meant more than a one-night stand.]]></review>

Musical remake of <i>The Philadelphia Story</i> which scores over the original only in its score. Crosby (especially) and Sinatra are miscast in the Cary Grant/James Stewart roles, and Grace Kelly only really catches the icy class of Tracy Lord, whereas Katharine Hepburn made her a complex comic creation. But despite many commentators' thumbs-down to one of Cole Porter's best late scores, the numbers are good, particularly the lesser-known ballads (like Bing's archetypal note-bending 'Samantha'). And there's not much gainsaying 'Well Did You Evah' (the only song not written for the movie, and it looks an intrusion) or 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?' (with the undervalued Celeste Holm). A slightly misbegotten musical, but with many pleasures and Louis Armstrong, growing into sweet avuncularity.]]></review>

The insolent sex talk of the original is here toned down, and the relaxed rumbustiousness of the safari love triangle is wholly in keeping with Ford's holidaying inclinations at the time. Half-hearted, half-baked, and at least half-watchable.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The third and most interesting of Nigel Kneale's <i>Quatermass</i> parables, scripted without interference by Kneale himself from his original TV series, so that his richly allusive web of occult, anthropological, religious and extraterrestrial speculation emerges intact as excavations at a London underground station turn up what appears to be an unexploded Nazi bomb, but proves to be a mysterious space craft. Hammer unfortunately delayed filming for several years, partly because of the sheer elaborateness of the subject matter, and partly because the plot did not lend itself to instant monster treatment. By the time the project came to be filmed, the company had moved from Bray and much of the atmosphere of their productions had been lost; but the brilliant pre-Von Daniken anthropological theme of Kneale's script still guarantees interest.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ray Harryhausen's first Dynamation effort in Arabian Nights territory. His knockout special effects include a cyclops, dragon, and duelling skeleton (forerunner of the battling skeletons sequence in<i> Jason and the Argonauts</i>), all expertly and realistically manipulated, employing techniques learned and developed from his mentor, the late, great Willis H <i>King Kong</i> O'Brien. Torin Thatcher's evil magician (a part he repeated for the less enthralling <i>Jack the Giant Killer</i>, also for Juran, three years later) more than compensates for Kerwin Mathews' rather wet Sinbad, while Bernard Herrmann's typically effective score tops off the whole adventure.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Showing, in a new print, at the centre of a season of must-see Japanese gems, Kurosawas depiction of the revelatory last days of an ageing Tokyo salaryman is one of the triumphs of humanist cinema. The superb Takashi Shimura is the lonely civil servant diagnosed with cancer: what begins with a study in gigantic pathos  in the style of Emil Janningss work for FW Murnau  richens and blossoms as a series of encounters open his eyes and heart. Kurosawas eclectic style is a delight: his striking, varied compositions reflecting the old mans journey from darkness to some kind of light right until the moving finale.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In a futuristic Old Detroit, the crime rates are soaring. Thirty-one cops have been wasted since Omni-Consumer Products took over responsibility for the police department; but, undaunted, Officer Murphy (Weller) and his cocky colleaguette Lewis (Allen) pursue a van-load of bank bandits into a derelict steel mill, where the sado-capitalists corner Murphy and use him for target practice. OCP's plans to construct Delta City can only go ahead if the designated area is safe enough for workers to go about their business unmolested. Their 'enforcement droid' ED 209, a galumphing giant cyborg, short-circuits at its unveiling, leaving the moribund Murphy, his insides wired into a computer-controlled titanium shell, to save the day. But RoboCop is not programmed to deal with corruption within the organisation. Verhoeven's blend of comic strip and snuff movie is vile, violent, and very funny. The pace is breakneck, and when the wit does run out, way-out weaponry and whole-scale destruction keep the appalled excitement burning.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Back from the future in which the machines rule comes a rippling robot (Schwarzenegger) who terminates opponents with extreme prejudice (like ripping their hearts out). His goal is to kill a woman (Hamilton) destined to bear the child who will become the great freedom fighter of the future. Fortunately she has a champion in the shape of another time traveller, Arnold's all-too-human opponent (Biehn). The gladiatorial arena is set, with vulnerable flesh and cunning versus a leviathan who totes around massive weapons like so many chic accessories and can rebuild his organs as they get shot away. The pacing and the action are terrific, revelling in the feral relentlessness which characterised <i>Assault on Precinct 13</i> and <i>Mad Max 2</i>; even the future visions of a wasted LA are well mounted. More than enough violence to make it a profoundly moral film; and Arnold's a whizz. CPea.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Buuel's last film, adapted from the Pierre Louys novel (about a woman who drives a man to distractions of frustrated desire) which also served as a basis for Sternberg's <i>The Devil Is a Woman</i>. Full of echoes from Buuel's earlier work, it might almost be seen as a summation of his preoccupation with the connection between sex and violence, first annotated in <i>L'Age d'or.</i> His great coup here is to have the object of the hero's lusts played by two different actresses, with the alternation of svelte coolness and steamy voluptuousness lending teasing credibility to the way in which his ardour is cruelly cooled and heated by turns. These sexual games are brilliantly and tantalisingly funny, but the film is meanwhile secretly pursuing another obscure object of desire: the terrorism which surfaces in various forms (moral, social, cultural, economic, psychological, and even political), ranging from the bomb outrages that accompany the hero in his sexual odyssey down to the financial pressures he exerts in order to have his way. And just as <i>L'Age d'or</i> ended with an equation between the sexual and revolutionary acts, so does <i>That Obscure Object of Desire,</i> though in a deliberately coded, mystificatory form.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Kurosawa's adaptation of <i>Macbeth</i> is reckoned by many, Peter Brook among them, to be one of the very few successful efforts at filming Shakespeare. Translating the familiar story to medieval Japan, with Macbeth as the samurai Washizu (Mifune), the adaptation deletes most of the minor characters, transforms the witches' scenes into a magical encounter with an old woman spinning in a forest glade, perches 'Cobweb Castle' high in the hilly moorland where the clouds roll by like ground-fog, and conceives a stunningly graphic fate for the usurper, clinging stubbornly to his promise of glory even as he is being turned into a human pin-cushion by volleys of arrows. It's visually ravishing, as you would expect, employing compositional tableaux from the Noh drama, high contrast photography, and extraordinary images of rain, galloping horses, the birds fleeing from the forest; all of which contribute to the expression of a doom-laden universe whose only way out for its tragic hero is auto-destruction.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Look at the date: 1938, the same year as Neville Chamberlains Munich agreement. This early-ish Hitchcock, showing as part of the Margaret Lockwood season at BFI Southbank, was made in the run-up to the last war and has debates over appeasement and engagement scribbled lightly all over it, while at the same time remaining funny, creepy (in a way already peculiar to Hitchcock) and always entertaining, both in the moment and in the realisation that youre enjoying a particularly witty and playful script.</p><p>We begin in a fictional, presumably Alpine, central European country where various parties, including Margaret Lockwoods bride-to-be, Iris, Naunton Wayne and Basil Radfords pair of cricket-fancying bounders, Caldicott and Charters, and May Whittys tweedy governess, Miss Froy, are gathered in a small hotel run by Emile Boreos Fawlty-esque manager and awaiting the next mornings train, delayed after an avalanche. When it leaves, Miss Froy disappears from Iris view and everybody proceeds to deny the old ladys existence, apart from Michael Redgraves caddish academic who joins Iris in a wilful search for the old dear in the face of brutal opposition from the trains varied cast of characters, from an Italian magician to an Austrian doctor. Whats happening in England? ask Caldicott and Charters. But its the cricket they care about, not politics or anything else beyond the crease. Another adulterous British couple refuse to get involved lest they reveal too much about their affair. The foreigners, meanwhile, mostly seem to be part of a horrible conspiracy. Very much of its time (in a good way), and very enjoyable.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Somewhere in cyberspace, Thonggrrrl14 is arranging a real world assignation with Lensman319. Later, they both try to play it cool while not quite disguising their anticipation, as conversation inevitably leads to an invitation back to his house. Shes 14 by the way, hes two decades her senior, with a penchant for photographing teenage models semi-dressed. Just when the idea of where this is going starts to get rather uncomfortable, a major plot reversal whisks the story in the opposite direction, equally squirm-worthy  especially for the men in the audience.<br />As scripted by playwright Brian Nelson, this virtual two-hander is an obvious provocation, setting the sexualisation of youth culture in collision with the sickness of paedophilia, and theres some pointed and passionate writing here. Unfortunately, it comes packaged in an increasingly lurid, credibility-free storyline, delivered with unstinting insensitivity by a first-time director determined to show off his ad-mans box of visual tics. In the circumstances, the actors are remarkable: Patrick Wilson offering courageous exposure of an addled soul, Ellen Page bravura beyond her years. A shame the grandstanding final reel fails them.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Walter Salles, whether working with Daniela Thomas (Foreign Land) or not (The Motorcycle Diaries), has shown himself to be one of the finest, most politically aware and technically accomplished talents in South American cinema. His latest, which casts a finely balanced eye over life in Brazils favelas through its study of the life of a lone mother and her four sons, offers a beguiling blend of urban poetry and extremely well-observed social realism.<br /><br />It begins with a disturbing howl emanating from the darkness of their poor apartment on the outskirts of So Paulo. This is no cry of despair but rather the labour yelps of the mother, Cleuza (Sandra Corveloni). The films excellent, dovetailed script and the liveliness of its performances provide an intimate, honest portrait of the four half-brothers: talented 18-year-old footballer Dario; messenger Dnis; religious pump attendant Dinho; and aspirant bus driver Reginaldo. The film speaks well of lived experience and difficult choices, stripped of many of the violent clichs, exaggerations and expressions of hopelessness in the face of poverty, corruption and crime depicted in some favela melodramas.<br /><br />Salles and Thomass movie contains some extraordinary moments and its fine editing injects a dynamic cross-cutting energy. But, it must be said, there are some stiff or incredible scenes that hark back to the sentimentality of old neo-realism, while its open-ended finale leaves the viewer a little let down and unsatisfied.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Last of the Samba Wine would be a fitting alternative title for this slight, OAP-heavy ensemble drama about the tantrums and tiaras, flirtations and fisticuffs that occur over one evening at a So Paulo dancehall. Little more than an excuse for director Las Bodanzky to let her camera linger meaningfully on the shuffling, spangled shoes of her elderly protagonists, this wannabe-steamy film never manages to generate any dramatic heat because it spreads itself far too thinly across its oversized and mundane cast. Ageing samba chanteuse Elza Soares is on hand to belt out a few numbers, and her thrilling stage presence and soulful vocal delivery make you wish this had been a concert film about her. But, alas, instead were forcefed reams of jealous fishwife prattling and lots of loaded reactions shots from all corners of the dancefloor. When events do flare up, theyre either totally improbable (a lithe twentysomething strumpet falling for a greasy, fat lothario because shes so enraptured by his moves? Really?) or just sickly sweet.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Elisabeth (Brenda Blethyn) is a nervy, bilingual widow and smallholder living on Guernsey, and Ousmane (Sotigui Kouyat), an ageing, solitary French-domiciled Muslim African and forester. Two people worlds and cultures apart, brought together in London in the immediate, tense aftermath of the July 7 2005 bomb attacks. As a frenetic Elisabeth criss-crosses the hospitals and police stations of Islington searching for her student daughter, her path constantly crosses that of Ousmane who is on a similar quest to find his long-estranged son. It soon transpires that their respective offspring were a couple: are they dead or alive, possible victims or even, unthinkably, perpetrators? <br />Theres awkwardness and truth in equal measure in the first British-based film from French-Algerian Rachid Bouchareb, director of Days of Glory. The film is as interested in the effects of catastrophic events on peoples behaviour and the possible fallout it might cause for multicultural relations as it is in the specific events of the 7/7 tragedy. <br />Theres a sense of representative caricature in the characters of London River, made more obvious by the primary contrasts and plot contrivances Bouchareb favours. That is mitigated, however, by the calm overall tone he adopts, the objectivity of his long-shot location work and the expanding emotional space he allows his two main protagonists. Elisabeths trajectory from ignorance to knowledge; from her (our?) initial xenophobia  This place is absolutely crawling with Muslims!  to greater understanding through the processes of intimate contact takes an age to lift off. But in the films latter stages, Blethyns heart-on-the-sleeve acting style finally combines with the marvellous Kouyats watchful intelligence and frail dignity to moving effect. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The comedian Chris Rock fronts this informative rummage through the $9 billion US black hair industry in a style much like his stand-up comedy: hilarious, insightful and charming enough to let him get away with the flammable stuff. What sets Rock on his journey is a question from his five-year-old daughter: Daddy, how come I dont have good hair? For all women, hair is tied up with image and self-esteem in ways an evolutionary psychologist could probably explain. Speaking to a cross-section of African Americans, Rock finds out that this relationship is even messier for them, with added cultural pressure to have straightened  ie white- or Asian-looking  hair.<br />A genial, probing interviewer, Rock extracts candid anecdotes from Maya Angelou, Ice T, the Reverend Al Sharpton and Salt-N-Pepa, and cheekily asks the actress Raven-Symon exactly where the human hair in her weave comes from. India, she answers, and off he goes to visit a Hindu temple where the hair from ritual head shavings is sold on and turned into hair weaves. Still, he gets his best lines closer to home in American barbershops and salons. In a Harlem barbers he asks one man which was more painful, being shot or getting his hair relaxed  the place is in stitches.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In the best surrealist tradition, Buuel claimed that his brilliant, disconcertingly funny joke - after an upper class dinner party, the guests find some mysterious compulsion making it impossible for them to leave the premises - has no rational explanation. True enough, but there are meanings aplenty in his powerful central image of decay as the vast, magnificently appointed bourgeois salon is gradually reduced to a sordid rubbish-heap where the once elegant guests squat and gnaw at bones. Significantly, the whole thing takes place under the sign of the church, but what still delights about the film is the way it refuses to be pigeonholed. Devastatingly funny, illuminated by unexpected shafts of generosity and tenderness, it remains one of Bunuel's very best.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
NW India, ages ago. Sent by his warlord boss to punish a village defaulting on tithes, warrior Lafcadia (Khan) finds himself unable to slay a young girl after noticing his son's pendant around her neck. But the tyrant won't tolerate deserters: when Lafcadia, laying aside his sword, tries to leave for his native village in the Himalayas, his former second-in-command, Biswas, captures and kills his son. Devastated, he continues his journey into the wilderness, meeting various loners as he goes, while Biswas follows in bloody pursuit. If some of the above sounds familiar, that's because the plot of Kapadia's fine feature debut echoes <i>The Outlaw Josey Wales</i> and several Mann and Boetticher Westerns; stylistically, however, Kurosawa and Leone are reference points. In other words, this is basically a Western transposed to India, but the brazenly mythic tone aligns it less closely with Hollywood models than with more reflexive storytelling traditions. With its stark narrative simplicity, its timeless setting and cipher characters, the epic mode may not produce psychological complexity, but it does score in terms of scale, sweep and sheer panache.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Based very loosely on a historical incident which took place in 1904, involving president Teddy Roosevelt in vote-catching reprisals for the kidnapping of an American citizen (here transformed into Candice Bergen and her two children) by a group of Arab 'bandits' in Morocco, Milius' film revives the desert epic with wit, style and a compelling brilliance in his handling of the Panavision format. Milius once more reveals that his overriding concern is with the formation of myth rather than realism, as he balances the fates of his two legendary figures - Brian Keith's Roosevelt and Sean Connery's kidnapper Raisuli - to dynamic effect. The result compares interestingly with the Paul Schrader-scripted <i>The Yakuza</i>, also much bound up with 'proving' an identity between two apparently alien codes. Towards the end, Milius does allow his film to become a distinctly nave fanfare on behalf of American interventionist policies, but then it is a film that thrives on a species of <i>navet. </i>VG.]]></review>

On the other hand, no film can be all bad which has a screen credit reading 'Fangs by Dr Ludwig von Krankheit'; and Polanski does pull out some gems, like the very Jewish monster menaced with a crucifix who cheerfully gloats, 'You got the wrong vampire, girl!' Other pluses include very attractive sets and Douglas Slocombe's camerawork, Krzysztof Komeda's bat-winged musical score, and the marvellous sequence of the great vampire ball, in which the guests rise from their graves to embark on a stately minuet that ends in front of a vast mirror reflecting only the three human interlopers.

      <review><![CDATA[Shot in 3-D - which resulted in some rather strained and awkward compositions - this nevertheless remains one of Hitchcock's very stagiest films. Milland is the has-been tennis star who decides to have his wife killed in order to lay his hands on her fortune; Kelly is the potential victim who cannot, at first, work out why a stranger should enter her house and try to murder her. It all moves along in a rather efficient if lifeless fashion, with only John Williams shining as a canny police detective, and only the murder scene itself breaking the tedium induced by Hitchcock's decision to shoot on a single apartment set.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Delightful if overrated comedy from Buuel, flitting about from frustrating situation to frustrating situation as six characters in search of a meal never manage actually to eat it. Are they prevented by their own fantasies? by their lack of purpose? by their discreet charm? Buuel never really lets us know, while managing to skip through some very funny scenes en route. But it does lack the savage bite and genuinely nightmarish feel of his earlier work (comparison with The Exterminating Angel shows up the later film's complacency), while the chic stylishness of the characters comes over as overbearing rather than satirically revealing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The movie's artistic credentials couldn't be more imposing (in addition to the various expatriate Surrealists/Dadaists who contributed episodes, there is music by John Cage and Darius Milhaud, among others), but that makes its manifest failure all the more striking. Richter has created a feeble pastiche of the contemporary <i>film noir</i> as the framing story, centring on a man with the power to generate dreams; other contributions are therefore integrated as dream sequences. The movie quickly degenerates into a series of party pieces: Duchamp rehashes his 'roto-reliefs' of 1927, Lger animates dolls, Calder animates his mobiles, and so on. Only Ernst, who recreates an image-sequence from his collage-novel <i>La Semaine de la Bont</i> in live action terms, emerges with much credit.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Scripted by Clement and Ian La Frenais, this vastly entertaining - if occasionally bewildering - comedy thriller stars Courtenay as the cowardly Otley, an innocent (though none too honest) Portobello Road layabout caught in a muddle of murder, mayhem and espionage. The plot never stops in its search for new ways to embarrass Otley: in one scene he seeks refuge in a crowd, only to find himself the only white man in a Black Power demonstration. More importantly, Otley's petty but human wheeling-and-dealing (lifting the odd art object for resale to the antique stalls) is consistently counterpoised to the slick inhumanity of his forever changing allies/friends, who only think of him as a tool to be used and then thrown away.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Machismo with schmaltz. Stallone plays some dumb trucker, into arm-wrestling, whose cab is a mobile gym. Twelve years ago - for some never-explained reason - he deserted his wife and kid, and now that his spouse is dying, he comes to collect his son from a military academy. An evil plutocratic grandfather doesn't like it; neither does the stuck-up cadet, but gradually his stand-offishness turns to love. Pop-promo tactics are resorted to only some of the time, and this enables the persistent humour and compassion of the script to shine through. Inevitably there is a bicep-bursting climax in Vegas, and even though he does wear clip-on ties, it is impossible not to root for the New Yorkie Bar man. What next, caber-tossing?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Everyone tries so hard at getting this adaptation of Hunter S Thompson's gonzo classic just right that one would love to like it more. Certainly, Gilliam pulls out the stops with the hallucinatory madness - the film does at least look good - and Depp and Del Toro, as the drug deranged heroes exploring the darkest excesses of the American Dream in 1971 Vegas, give their energetic all. The trouble is, they end up mugging like mad, and it's all too relentlessly weird, wacky and tacky: it takes an hour before the pace calms down sufficiently to let in a few laughs, and only Barkin, in a brief (and superior) scene towards the end anchors the manic antics in some sort of human reality. A film of brilliant moments, but sadly less coherent - and, on senses, rather less personal - than most of Gilliam's work.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of the sly, Spanish provocateurs greatest popular successes, Belle de Jour  revived in a new print as centrepiece of a two-month NFT Buuel retrospective  is a mischievously deadpan and classically cool 1967 adaptation of Joseph Kessels cheap fictionalised tale of a Parisian doctors wife who secretly volunteers for the two-till-five shift at an upmarket brothel. It opens with French cinemas prim, fair Miss Frigidaire, Catherine Deneuve, being roughly trussed and stripped by her husband, before the little whore is whipped and distainfully left for the carnal satisfaction of his two coachmen. As Buuel and his scriptwriter Jean-Claude Carrire make clear, this is a mere fantasy in the head of their masochistic heroine. Nevertheless, it was received as a confrontational liberationist shock at the time. If, for us jaded children and grandchildren of the 60s, 40 years of bombardment by explicit sexual imagery has made that impact unrecoverable, the undiminished power of the film resides more in the mesmeric audacity of Buuels method. The productive friction  be it between the salacious material and the chaste formality of how its observed; the ersatz elegance of the salon and the perverse etiquettes of the Yves Saint Laurent-clothed, cigarette-chewing prostitutes and their clients; or the hallucinatory melding of fantasy and reality  still generates heat like a nuclear reactor.]]></review>

Despite the Vermeer-like compositions, he has some trouble capturing the right tone for the 'realistic' scenes, but the sequences in the  enchanted castle - wonderfully designed by Christian Brard complete with fantastic living statuary, and dignified by a Beast at once ferocious, erotic and genuinely tragic - are pure magic. Ren Clment is credited as co-director, but had very little to do with the <i>mise en scne</i>.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Winner of the 1959 Palme dOr at Cannes and the Oscar for Best Foreign Film, this retelling of the Orpheus story in carnival-thronged Rio hasnt altogether escaped the ravages of time. Although Marcel Camus film sprang from contemporary currents in Brazil (based on a theatre piece by Vinicius de Moraes, and gaining immeasurably from its classic samba score by fresh talents Luiz Bonf and Antonio Carlos Jobim), its still hard to escape the suspicion that the French director is exploiting the abundant local colour for his own purposes. That said, his largely non-professional cast acquit themselves with an appealing sincerity as handsome trolleybus conductor Orfeu (Breno Mello) falls for visiting innocent Eurydice (Marpessa Dawn), despite the fact hes engaged to the brazen Mira (Lourdes de Oliveira). Romantic intrigue soon gives way to an altogether darker mood though, as Orfeu finds himself unable to protect his new love from the unwelcome attentions of a dark stranger, who makes his fatal strike while the carnivals at its height and his skeleton outfit blends right in.Its a film that improves as it goes along, the clunky comedy of the happy favelas eclipsed by an imaginative transposition of the Orphic legend, cleverly using locations such as the citys missing-persons bureau and a Macumba ceremony seemingly halfway between revivalist meeting and voodoo frenzy. Presumably, this ethnographic aspect impressed at the time, but nowadays its the incredibly rich whirl of colour and movement captured by Jean Bourgoins gorgeous cinematography and the timelessly appealing soundtrack (inspiration for a subsequent generation of jazzmen) that continue to cast a spell. A mixed bag then, but the highlights are memorable.]]></review>

Fortunately the story of an alternative future is realised with such visual imagination and sparky humour that it's only half way through that the plot's weaknesses become apparent. Like 1984, it looks forward from the '40s to a vast urban society ruled by an oppressive bureaucracy that has developed primitive valve computers. Pryce plays a worker in the all-powerful Ministry of Information, and the best moments arise when his flat's central heating system becomes a kind of spiritual battleground between guerrilla engineer De Niro and his state opposite number Hoskins. Here Gilliam fuses terror and comedy with real brilliance; elsewhere the plot's gaping holes reduce the film to a glittering novelty.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Led by Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (Malkovich), a dozen jailbirds hijack a transport plane. Only parolee Cameron Poe (Cage) - caught up in the middle - stands between the worst of the worst and their freedom. Scott Rosenberg's ingeniously tooled script recalls such vintage entertainments as <i>The Dirty Dozen</i> and <i>The Great Escape</i>. Dialogue is pared to bullet points, punctuation between spectacular set-pieces, but Rosenberg makes every word count. If it needs strong actors to flesh out the characterisation, so be it: Rhames, Buscemi, Trejo - faces you don't forget in a hurry. Sometimes skin deep is close enough. Commercials director West gives us the hard sell non-stop for 115 ear-splitting minutes. There are misjudgments. He gets off on male flesh rippling against slow motion fireballs, and has no time for women, but throws in a transvestite for cheap jibes. The climax looks like an afterthought, and in trying to top itself, the movie finally goes OTT. Very cool, but also very cold.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Bertoluccis beautiful, idea-laden and thrilling film noir, released in post-vnements 1970, opens with a Paris hotel sign flashing on a man with a fedora, a gun and a naked woman. But Bertoluccis late-30s-set adaptation of Albert Moravias novel examining Italys fascist past was no exercise in black-and-white nostalgia.<br /><br />The noir elements  the complex flash-back structure and the out-of-kilter Third Man-syle camera angles framing its anti-hero, volunteer assassin Jean-Louis Trintignant  are a mere frame, pencil drawings on which cinematographer Vittorio Storaro paints his Freudian washes of blue and red. <br />Even at the time of the The Conformist, with its poison-penned quotations of Godard, Bertolucci was already showing himself the greatest pleasure seeker of the children of Marx and Coca-Cola agit-prop school. Trintignants classically-educated Marcello Clerici  he quotes Emperor Hadrian and Platos Allegory of the Cave  is the epitome of the repressed bourgeois, so ashamed of his mad father and opium-addicted mother to be delighted, in shades of Sartres Daniel, to be married to a mediocre wife full of paltry ideas and prepared to commit murder to follow the flow of fascist political fashion. Until that is, he claps eyes on the beautiful, decadent wife (Dominique Sanda) of his old tutor and present target, Professor Quadri (Enzo Tarascio). <br />Its a dazzling film, dated only in its sense of passionate intellectual engagement, which seductively balances its seditious syllabus of politics, philosophy and sex with a serio-comic tone, exemplified by Gastone Moschins near pantomimic Blackshirt and Georges Delerues delightful score.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Maybe Losey simply lived too long with a project he had been trying to get off the ground ever since he first directed Laughton in Brecht's play in 1947, and which emerges here as a curiously academic exercise. For one thing, giving a likeable but lightweight performance, Topol is allowed to get away with presenting Galileo as a hero, which makes nonsense of Brecht's condemnation of him as a coward for his betrayal of science (the crucial carnival scene now becomes just a jolly romp). For another, Losey hedges uncertainly between theatre and cinema, so that Brecht's linking songs and captions are retained, but rendered in 'cinematic' ways that make them both clumsy and tautological. By far the most striking sequence is also the most purely theatrical (Galileo's daughter and disciples waiting anxiously to hear whether he has recanted, shot on a bare stage with stark, theatrical groupings and spotlights projecting a shadow-play of their emotions on the cyclorama behind). Elsewhere, smooth theatrical continuity tends to blunt the raw edges of Brecht's distancing effects.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
Bergman at his most brilliant as he explores the symbiotic relationship that evolves between an actress suffering a breakdown in which she refuses to speak, and the nurse in charge as she recuperates in a country cottage. To comment is to betray the film's extraordinary complexity, but basically it returns to two favourite Bergman themes: the difficulty of true communication between human beings, and the essentially egocentric nature of art. Here the actress (named Vogler after the charlatan/artist in <i>The Face</i>) dries up in the middle of a performance, thereafter refusing to exercise her art. We aren't told why, but from the context it's a fair guess that she withdraws from a feeling of inadequacy in face of the horrors of the modern world; and in her withdrawal, she watches with detached tolerance as humanity (the nurse chattering on about her troubled sex life) reveals its petty woes. Then comes the weird moment of communion in which the two women merge as one: charlatan or not, the artist can still be understood, and can therefore still understand. Not an easy film, but an infinitely rewarding one.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An adaptation of concert pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman's memoirs about his experiences in Nazi-occupied Warsaw, Polanski's cinematic return to the ravaged world of his childhood starts inauspiciously, lumbered with the clichs of Ronald Harwood's script. The actors (mostly from British TV) who play the musician's doomed family squabble to order about how to react to events. Once Szpilman is left behind, however, and forced to hide in empty apartments in the ever more unrecognisable city, his struggle simply to survive is rendered with increasing subtlety, and Brody's lead performance steadily comes into its own. Old-fashioned in both visual and narrative style and in its overall restraint, the film clearly benefits from the director's first-hand knowledge of the territory.]]></review>

The theme of the group of professionals coming together to defend a cause or undertake a useless task, mainly as an exercise for their narcissistic talents, was one that would be constantly reworked during the '60s. Numerous set pieces, like Coburn's knife fight, Vaughn's fly-catching and McQueen's jokes, stay lodged in the mind.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Less polished than <i>The Tomb of Ligeia</i>, but still the best and most ambitious of Corman's Poe cycle. Apart from a scruffy opening scene, it looks stunningly handsome, with Nicolas Roeg's camera providing alluring effects like the sudden switches from white to yellow, purple to black, as Jane Asher scurries through a sequence of rooms each designed in a different colour. It is also graced by an intelligent script (the admirable Charles Beaumont) which probes the concept of diabolism with considerable subtlety, even though the black magic scenes were removed in Britain by the censor. Where most films of this nature tend simply to pile on the blood, here there is a genuine chill of intellectual evil in the philosophical speculations of Price's 12th century Italian Prince Prospero, 'safely' immured in his castle while the plague rages outside, dreaming up fiendish ways of entertaining/tormenting his prisoner-guests.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Cocteau described this first feature as the playing with one finger of a theme that he orchestrated in <i>Orphe</i> twenty years later. That puts it fairly enough: the movie has an avant-garde roughness and unpredictability in its construction and use of symbols, but it's fundamentally a very characteristic, neo-Romantic study of the joys and agonies of being an artist. It's in two distinct parts. The first presents the artist (Rivero) trapped by his own work, eventually opting for the rebirth of a romantic martyrdom; the second plunges back into autobiography (reworking the snowball fight from <i>Les Enfants Terribles</i>), and resolves itself into a 'cosmic' riddle. The honesty and robustness of the images prevents the movie from lapsing into pretension or preciousness; it remains extremely interesting as a source of Cocteau's later work.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Now celebrated as the first explicitly feminist film, <i>Madame Beudet</i> is a rare and outstanding example of Dulac's pioneering work (hard to categorise, the director is best known as a theorist and a leading member of the avant-garde). It marked a major advance towards psychological development in film, with its symbolism and experimental use of camera, lighting, superimposition and slow motion techniques to evoke the shifting mental and emotional state of an unsmiling woman (Germaine Dermoz) crushed by an oppressive marriage and finding momentary liberation in fantasy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Made between <i>Seven Samurai</i> and <i>Throne of Blood</i>, this contemporary social problem movie is Kurosawa's least commercially successful work. Mifune is the ageing, patriarchal head of a Tokyo family who, terrified at the prospect of a nuclear war, decides to sell up the family business and emigrate to a farm in Brazil. With Mifune uncomfortable playing a character twice his real age, and the character himself rendered incoherent by a script which seems uncertain whether it's him or society which is insane, a volunteer court official (Shimura) - required to adjudicate in the ensuing family squabble - a little awkwardly assumes the role of moral centre. It's a problematic film, wearing its uncertainties on its sleeve; but whether shooting in long takes or cutting the footage from multiple camera shooting, Kurosawa remains the cinema's supremely humanist emotional manipulator. See it and worry.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Part-financed by American singer Georgette Leblanc, who also stars, this was designed as a sort of showcase for contemporary French arts. So, decorating a tolerably camp story about a heartless woman (Leblanc) who is poisoned by one disappointed lover (Hriat) and scientifically resuscitated into new humanity by another (Catelain), it boasts extravagant Cubist settings (by Fernand Lger, Robert Mallet-Stevens, Claude Autant-Lara and Alberto Cavalcanti), features costumes by Paul Poiret, incorporates a Jean Borlin ballet, makes coy reference to radio and TV, and was originally accompanied by a Darius Milhaud score. The result, resolutely chic, brought instant sneers about aesthetic dilettantism which L'Herbier was subsequently never quite able to shake off. But despite the wretched acting and daft script (by Pierre Mac Orlan), the last third of the film, in which L'Herbier's attempt to apply a different mood and rhythm to each setting begins to pay dividends, is often remarkable in the way it manipulates space as an autonomous element in the drama.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Jigalong was a depot on the longest fence in the world, a dusty, fly-blown place which was home to the half-caste children Molly Pilkington, her sister Gracie and their cousin Daisy - until white officers came, stole them away from their mothers and deposited them 1,200 miles away in an orphanage in Moore River. Here they were to be groomed for domestic service, brought to Christianity, and prepared for marriage to whites. It was the Chief Protector's zealous conviction that the aborigine must be bred out of them. He reckoned without the determination of a 14-year-old girl. A rare movie that justifies the kind of bombastic rhetoric you hear on trailers and ads, Noyce imbues a very simple true story from the 1930s with the force of anger and emotion. It's impossible not to be moved as the three young girls make their break for freedom and set off on foot for home, with only the fence to guide them. Well acted and evocatively scored by Peter Gabriel, the film's single strongest asset must be Christopher Doyle's photography, which renders the girls' odyssey a stark, elemental trek across a vast horizon.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its hard to argue with the fact that the central conceit of Kurosawas global breakthrough  presenting divergent perspectives on a single contentious incident  provides such a strikingly insightful way of looking at the world that the term Rashomon has entered the language. Far more people are au fait with this idea, however, than have seen the 1950 film, so this digital restoration as part of the BFIs Kurosawa retrospective is welcome. Thankfully, visionary 1920s short-story specialist Ryunosuke Akutagawas multi-layered tale of rape and murder in feudal Japan doesnt disappoint, and the switchback narrative, as befuddled parties shelter under the old Kyoto city gate to try and make sense of bandit Tajomarus attack on a travelling samurai and his wife, remains engrossing and provocative as conflicting testimonies emerge.<br /><br />Admirers of the subtleties of Ozu and Mizoguchi, however, might find Kurosawas upfront project of attempting to make sense of human nature (irredeemable or not?) a little too obviously didactic  and Toshiro Mifunes central performance veering on the hammy side of earthy. Those cavils aside, whats still staggering is the vigour, fluidity and sheer invention of Kurosawas direction. No one anywhere in 1950 made the camera engage with movement and location in the way Kurosawa does here, slicing through the forest, and bringing a kinetic impact to violent confrontations, which is evidently the foundation for modern action cinema. This level of mastery is timeless, and although the movie is overly deliberate at times, when it takes off, it really flies. An essential reissue.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
Of all Hitchcock's films, this is the one which most reveals the man. As usual it evolves from one brilliantly plain idea: Stewart, immobilised in his apartment by a broken leg and aided by his girlfriend (Grace Kelly at her most Vogue-coverish), takes to watching the inhabitants across the courtyard, first with binoculars, later with his camera. He thinks he witnesses a murder... There is suspense enough, of course, but the important thing is the way that it is filmed: the camera never strays from inside Stewart's apartment, and every shot is closely aligned with his point of view. And what this relentless monomaniac witnesses is everyone's dirty linen: suicide, broken dreams, and cheap death. Quite aside from the violation of intimacy, which is shocking enough, Hitchcock has nowhere else come so close to pure misanthropy, nor given us so disturbing a definition of what it is to watch the 'silent film' of other people's lives, whether across a courtyard or up on a screen. No wonder the sensual puritan in him punishes Stewart by breaking his other leg. CPea.]]></review>

What really distinguishes the film are the tremulous, nervy performances, although Rudolph's direction - while occasionally too arty - is imbued with an admirable generosity towards the characters. Also endowed with a fine blues score by (and performed by) Alberta Hunter, and crisp photography from Tak Fujimoto, it's well worth seeing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
The tall tales of the legendary 18th-century Baron Munchausen would seem perfect subject matter for Gilliam's fertile imagination; indeed, despite production problems, the film is an engaging and dottily fantastic spectacular. The Baron (Neville) and his superhuman colleagues are rather colourless creations, but the characters they encounter during their odyssey - mafioso-like King of the Moon (Williams), love-lorn Vulcan (Reed) - are vivid and funny. Still more bizarre is the look of the film: an island transformed into a monstrous fish, a balloon sewn from underwear sailing over a war-torn city, a ship rippling through a desert strewn with statuary. But this third part of Gilliam's trilogy, about 'the triumph of imagination over rationality' and lighter in tone than <i>Brazil</i>, hardly warrants serious analysis. More of its budget should have been spent on the script - there are jarring leaps in the narrative - but it's good, intelligent fun, and occasionally truly surprising.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA['Our sexual desire has to be seen as the product of centuries of repressive and emasculating Catholicism... it is always coloured by the sweet secret sense of sin,' mused Buuel in his autobiography <i>My Last Breath.</i> One might describe <i>L'Age d'Or</i> as 63 minutes of <i>coitus interruptus</i>, a scabrous essay on Eros and civilisation, wherein a couple is constantly prised apart from furious love-making by the police, high society and, above all, the Church. Financed by the Vicomte de Noailles, a dream patron who loyally pronounced the film exquisite and delicious, even as right-wing extremists were pelting it with ink and stink bombs, this is a jagged memento of that Golden Age before directors forgot the art of filming erotica (the celebrated toe-sucking is sexier by far than almost anything since), the revolutionary avant-garde lost its sense of humour, and surrealism itself fell prey to advertising-agency chic.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Inspired by a real-life incident, this captivating Israeli film is both a compelling story of self-determination and an astute evaluation of the current state of a divided territory. On the border of the West Bank, a Palestinian household has tended its lemon grove for generations, but when the Israeli Defence Minister (Doron Tavory) moves in just the other side of the perimeter, his guards decide that the trees constitute a security risk and must be chopped down. <br />Fortysomething widow Salma (Hiam Abbass, the wonderful Palestinian actress from Tom McCarthys The Visitor) wont give up on her familys heritage so easily. As new military watchtowers loom over her property, she makes the decision to engage an overworked local lawyer (Ali Suliman) to tackle the full might of the Israeli state in court.<br /><br />Israeli director Eran Rikliss film, co-written by Palestinian journalist Suha Arraf, encompasses wider issues beyond this admittedly engrossing legal mismatch. For one thing, it exposes the vulnerable position of a lone widow in a retrenched, conservative Arab community, yet it also allows for glimmers of compassion across the partisan rift, fascinatingly tracing a surprising complicity between Salma and the Defence Ministers increasingly sceptical spouse (Rona Lipaz-Michael). Mindful of its evidently symbolic import, yet generous to its characters on both sides, the story builds narrative momentum from its battling underdog through-line, yet theres no hint of oversimplification. Persuasive, lived-in performances inscribe the possibility of hope on an individual level, yet Riklis is also enough of a realist to work his way towards a powerfully sobering final image. Abbasss soulful resilience is the emotional clincher.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Whether you consider Doors singer Jim 
Morrison a valued addition to the rock pantheon or a vain, 
attention-seeking, pretentious ponce who wrote hippy-drippy poetry in 
his spare time, you cant deny the enigmatic anti-authoritarian Lizard 
King cut a charismatic swagger. He had a great voice too. Unlike so many
 other rockumentaries about dead stars, Tom 
DiCillos biography doesnt lumber itself with voxpops from band 
members and friends. Instead, the story is told via a montage of 
fascinating and rarely seen archive footage. Meanwhile Johnny Depp 
offers one of the most authoritative narratives in years, proving that, 
when hes past acting, he should consider a twilight career in 
audiobooks.<br />By the summer of 67, The Doors had become one of 
Americas most beloved and subversive acts. Yet, as this well-crafted 
film illustrates, the attention always focused on Morrison, his binges 
and his notorious on-stage outbursts involving drugged-out lunacy, 
vitriol and indecent exposure. Boy, they dont make em like that any 
more.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p><i>Read our interview with Gilliam here</i><br />There cant have been a movie-lover on the planet who didnt want  Doctor Parnassus to be great, a triumphant comeback for a troubled director after his leading man passed away during production. Terry Gilliams struggle to bring Heath Ledgers last performance to the screen was laudable: he rallied a crack crew of A-listers (including Johnny Depp and Jude Law) to essay enigmatic variations on their fallen comrade, all the while struggling with his own grief at the loss of a friend.But theres no escaping the fact that the completed film, though lovingly made, is something of a mess. Set in a stark contemporary London, its a patronising elegy for the death of the public imagination, as personified by Christopher Plummers Parnassus, a travelling teller of tall tales whose audience is progressively shrinking.<br />Ledger excels as snake-tongued amnesiac Tony Liar, who hops aboard the ramshackle Imaginarium and begins to charm punters with his raffish air of money-grubbing mischief. But his performance  the films trump card  is repeatedly elbowed out by a centuries-spanning duel between Parnassus and Tom Waitss cigar-chomping Satan, told in garish CG flashbacks.<br />Its telling that Parnassus, an unsubtle proxy for the director, never recognises his own culpability as his audiences interest dwindles: its modern mans refusal to open his mind, not the artists unwillingness to connect, that dooms the Imaginarium. Its unlikely Gilliams own, undeniably brilliant career will be revitalised by this rambling, undisciplined and indulgent piece of work.</p><p><i>Read our interview with Gilliam here</i> <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Unspeakably bad digimation sequel which comprises a total vacuum of charm, energy, surprise and coherence and only barely delivers on the promises of its title (only one chimp actually goes into space and Zartog's attempt at 'striking back' is utterly feeble). Everything about the film gives you the sense that its makers had one eye on the clock so they wouldnt miss happy hour: the barren, blocky backdrops look like theyve only been partially rendered; the body movements of the chimps seem to bear no physical relation to the space they inhabit; the faces (specifically the lip movements) are so poorly animated that it constantly looks like the sound is out of sync; single jokes are stretched to breaking point  one in which we realise that a crew of human technicians cant grasp the language of the evil alien Zartog is repeated four of five times; even the story feels like its been mangled together from a series of test shots and stand alone sketches. And for those with itchy trigger fingers when it comes to 3D, its barely even noticeable here.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Having cut his fangs on tween revenger Hard Candy and inventive bloodsucker 30 Days of Night, could director David Slade kick off a Harry Potter-like reinvigoration of the Twilight series? Well, sort of: Eclipse is a step up from the painfully anaemic New Moon, and its clearly the work of a filmmaker keen to put his own stamp on the series. But Slade is constrained at every turn by the sheer, crushing lifelessness of author Stephenie Meyers material.<br />Eclipse barely advances the story at all: were still stuck in the town of Forks, where moody heroine Bella (Kristen Stewart) is forced to choose between undead love-of-her-life Edward (Robert Pattinson) and musclebound werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner). There are lots of other characters  silly names are dropped with dizzying regularity  but none of them actually seem to do very much.<br />Slade directs with flair: his action sequences, though small in scale, have real drive, and a series of surprisingly grim Civil War flashbacks enable him to utilise a different visual palette from the usual drab greens and greys.<br /><br />But he cant disguise the massive flaws inherent in the screenplay: the slipshod plotting, whiny, self-serious tone and excruciating abstinence-first subplot. The biggest problem remains the characters: neither Slade nor Stewart are capable of turning manipulative whinger Bella into anything more than a joyless black hole sucking the life from every scene, while the only performer capable of giving her part any spark, Anna Kendrick, is completely sidelined this time around. Strictly for Twihards.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This pleasant, minor-register French romcom spins its yarn, develops its themes and fleshes out its characters with such surefootedness and ease that you would understand if someone such as Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson was lined up to star in a remake. <br />Actor Nicolas Cazal brings charm and presence to the role of Antoine, the gruff, rudderless son of a rural grocer who harbours coiled affections for his attractive neighbour, Claire (Clotilde Hesme). When his father is hospitalised, he decides to leave the city (with Claire in tow) and help out by taking over his role as roving vendor, chugging around the countryside in an old van and passing on supplies to the regions elderly and infirm. Its a small, well-rounded movie that youd be hard pressed to find fault with, achieving its modest goals with subtle aplomb while whipping up humour and empathy from Antoines rapport with his doddery clientele.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The problem with a film like The Brothers Bloom  a self-consciously labyrinthine tale of con-men and comeuppance  is that it practically demands to be second guessed, with the result that any half-intelligent audience member is going to spend their time trying to anticipate the next plot revelation rather than simply enjoying the experience. Its a shame, because the film has a solid pedigree: Adrien Brody and Mark Ruffalo are sparky and fun as the titular ripoff artists trawling the world in search of easy money, while Rachel Weisz brings much-needed pathos to her role as their hapless, wealthy mark. Director Rian Johnson delivers the same energy he brought to his debut, the equally flawed but fun Brick, with some terrific music choices and fantastic globetrotting location photography. But it never amounts to anything much: Johnson is so intent on wrongfooting his audience that he consistently undermines his characters, and the revelations, when they come, are rarely surprising or unexpected enough to warrant the investment.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Promising Ghanaian footballer Francis Boadi is not unlike thousands of other African kids dreaming that one day a scout will spot their talent and whisk them off to Europe. Baff Akotos 52-minute documentary about him isnt especially well made but it illustrates the seriousness with which African youngsters treat the sport and how football is arguably the only industry capable of launching someone from poverty to fame and fortune. However, as Boadi and his manager know only too well, the road to the top of international football entails an almost insurmountable number of hoops and hurdles. </p><p>Its unlikely this film would have been given a release had it not been for the World Cup: the editing is erratic, the sound is muddy, the visuals are shaky and its crying out for a voiceover. Interesting in parts but ultimately dull, even for football fans.</p>]]></review>

Steiger and Courtenay excepted, all the performances are very uncomfortable.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hollywood's one bona fide popular smash of summer 2003 has been this little number from Pixar studios - the CGI animators behind <i>Toy Story</i>, <i>A Bug's Life</i> and <i>Monsters, Inc.</i> As that list suggests, environment may be the key creative determinant for a Pixar film, and so it is with <i>Finding Nemo</i>, a sentimental fable that surely wouldn't stand up on dry land, but it plays like a dream in its marine milieu. Marlin (voiced by Brooks) is a queer fish, an over-protective parent and a neurotic, self-absorbed widower who's terrified of letting young Nemo out of sight. No sooner has small fry started school than he gets himself hooked and whisked off to a dentist's fishtank in Sydney. Will cowardly Marlin find the gumption to cross the Great Barrier Reef and rescue his son? And if he does, will this spineless vertebrate ever let Nemo grow up and be his own fish? This is overlong, a bit wet and quite probably sexist, but I was swept up in its dazzling stream of rainbow corals, amused by the stoner turtles going with the flow, sharks battling their own regressive instincts and DeGeneres' scatterbrained Dory. Even coasting, Pixar's a sure thing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Sounds horrible: a comedy about a big shaggy dog which wins the love of a suburban family by destroying their home. Things start out badly when baby Beethoven (a St Bernard so named for his musicality) piddles on a pet shop patron before the credits are finished. Mercifully, the excrement gags are soon exhausted and things take a turn for the better, thanks largely to the sublimely sour-faced antics of Charles Grodin as dad, a neurotic dog-hater who markets air-fresheners for a living. Elevated from the doldrums of <i>Digby</i>-esque sentimentality by a surprisingly bouncy script, the film is also redeemed by regular interludes of acerbic dialogue and a brace of fine supporting performances (notably David Duchovny as a slimy yuppie git who says 'Ciao, bello!' and criticises the cappuccino).]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Peter Jackson's zombiefest follow-up to <i>Bad Taste</i>, set in suburbia in the late '50s, is 'a slapstick comedy with blood and guts instead of custard pies'. When 25-year-old virgin Lionel (Balme) falls for the lovely Paquita (Pealver), he provokes his domineering mother's jealousy. Soon after, a toxic nip from a Sumatran rat-monkey at the local zoo transforms Lionel's mother - through several putrescent stages - into a hideous, pustulant monster with a craving for human flesh. The finale, in which Lionel reduces a horde of flesh-eaters to a mulch of blood, flesh and offal with the aid of a flymo, is probably the goriest scene ever.]]></review>

From there on, Blake Edwards flexes his Jacques Tati muscles, spinning an elaborate garland of gags around one rather drawn-out situation as Sellers - seconded by a drunken waiter and a baby elephant - innocently reduces the party by degrees to an apocalyptic shambles and his hosts to gibbering wrecks. Quite a few very funny moments, but one doesn't laugh so much as admire the ingenuity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Knowing in advance that Fassbinder considers the institution of marriage to be the most insidious trap that mankind has yet devised for itself doesn't prepare you for <i>The Marriage of Maria Braun</i>. It opens in 1943 as an air raid hits Maria and Hermann Braun's wedding ceremony, and closes with another explosion, highly ambiguous in effect and implication. In between, Hermann goes missing on the Russian front, serves years in jail, and emigrates to the States, while Maria sails through unruffled, acquiring wealth and position pending his return. It is at once Fassbinder's most conventional and elusive film: that final explosion keeps ricocheting long after it's over.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
The big box-office success of the British New Wave in the early '60s, no doubt because its hero's defiant watchword of 'Don't let the bastards grind you down' struck a responsive chord before everybody started never having had it so good. Much of the freshness survives in Finney's abrasive performance as the young Nottingham factory worker lashing blindly out at the bleak working class horizons to which he has been bred by parents 'dead from the neck up'. Trying to grab what life can offer with both hands without regard for consequences or for anybody else, he ends up with nothing but the final gesture of defiance of hurling a stone at the housing estate where he is about to settle down and live unhappily for ever after. But it all seems terribly glib now, at worst sailing close to parody, at best suffused with the faintly patronising sincerity of the Angry Young Man/New Left era.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Against the fractured density of <i>Mirror</i>, <i>Stalker</i> sets a form of absolute linear simplicity. The Stalker leads two men, the Writer and the Professor, across the Zone - a forbidden territory deep inside a police state - towards the Room, which can lay bare the devices and desires of your heart. However, let no one persuade you that this is sci-fi or common allegory. The ragged, shaven-headed men are familiar from Solzenitzyn, and the zone may be a sentient landscape of hallucinatory power, but its deadly litter of industrial detritus is all too recognisable. The wettest, grimmest trek ever seen on film leads to nihilistic impasse - huddled in dirt, the discovery of faith seems impossible; and without faith, life outside the Zone, impossible. But hang on in to the ending, where a plain declaration of love and a vision of pure magic at least point the way to redemption. As always, Tarkovsky conjures images like you've never seen before; and as a journey to the heart of darkness, it's a good deal more persuasive than Coppola's. Cpea.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Despite a gritty screenplay by Pete Dexter from Kim Wozencraft's factual book, Zanuck's debut feature fails to keep its dramatic sightlines clear. Perhaps it would take an ironist like the Kurt Vonnegut of <i>Mother Night</i> to give us some perspective on the two undercover narcotics cops (Patric and Leigh) who begin to use the stuff heavily as a cover, and blur into the sort of mess they're pledged to eradicate. Set in the unlovely '70s, there's no shortage of going downhill in loons. If the film doesn't cheat, it doesn't stir one to pity either, perhaps because neither lead is sympathetic - both cops pose and mumble - and their love affair on the physical level borders on rape. Leigh simply isn't police material, particularly for Texas. Eric Clapton's music and the presence of a villainous Gregg Allman will be flashcards to those who like that sort of thing. A downer.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
Despite a pacy, technically brilliant but otherwise slightly ordinary first half-hour or so, Scorseses Howard Hughes movie is his best since The Age of Innocence. The tycoon is presented  empathetically?  as an independent-minded American visionary: this celebration of rugged individualism ends conveniently in 1947 with the (single) successful flight of his titanic Hercules, nicknamed Spruce Goose, and a courageous, corrosively witty courtroom stand against corrupt Senator Brewster (Alan Alda, gloriously venal); it never feels the need to broach the more notorious lunacies of later years. Yes, Howies eccentric  arent all visionaries?  deaf and troubled, but as incarnated by Leo DiCaprio, hes also a cute, charismatic, all-round nice guy. Heck, his capitalistic excesses mustve been just another example of his special  genius, like his passion for flight and his chat-up routines. This is Hughes as populist hero, a twentieth-century pioneer. (A friend reckons its like Tucker, which it is, albeit rather darker.)<br />Actually, DiCaprios excellent, gaining depth and subtlety as Hughes ages. One may question the wisdom of having Cate Blanchett mimic Kate Hepburn  though its a very good impersonation, it means ones continually comparing it to the original, instead of simply accepting her as a character, as one does with Kate Beckinsales Ava Gardner  but the cast (which includes Alec Baldwin, John C Reilly and Ian Holm) generally perform beautifully, though mostly in minute roles. In terms of time, space and impact, its the leads film, and hes far better here than in Gangs of New York. <br />So is Scorsese, coming into his own when his hero cracks, steering the mise-en-scne into an expressionist register reminiscent of films by Michael Powell or Nick Ray. Theres some early Hawks, Sternberg and Sirk in there too, which suggests the richness of a visual/narrative style entirely in keeping with the subject. After all, Hughes wasnt just about money, planes and cleavages; he made movies too, which clearly makes him okay in Martys book.

      <review><![CDATA[Von Trier is back to the vaguely anti-American concerns and stark sub-Brechtian style of Dogville, with considerably diminished returns. Grace and her gangster father (Howard and Dafoe, replacing  none too successfully  Kidman and Caan) arrive at an Alabama plantation which, they find, still practices slavery decades after its abolition; backed up by the guns of her dads henchmen, the headstrong young woman frees the slaves, makes the late owners family their equals, and sets about encouraging them all to build a new democratic society; needless to say, things dont work out as planned Be it a reflection on racial inequality, a philosophical treatise on the nature of freedom, or an allegory about the Bush administrations nation-building policies, the film fails, partly because what it has to say is so muddled and inadequate, partly because  as cinema and as drama  it is so dull. The dialogue is dreary, the acting listless, and the gimmicky mise-en-minimaliste-scne simply irrelevant. If Von Trier decides to complete his American trilogy, the final episode will have to be a big improvement on this fiasco if were to stick with it to the end.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Christopher Nolan follows the sombre origin myth of Batman Begins with a less introspective, more frenetic sequel. Once again there are lots of ideas on the boil, this time mostly to do with community action and leadership, but an endless flow of bullets, bombs and bat business drowns out most debate. Right from the off, Nolan sidesteps the analysts couch and plunges us straight into battle.<br /><br />He starts with a disorienting bank robbery and from there barely allows us to breathe  or think, even  over the next two and a half hours as we swing from the US to Hong Kong and back to the streets of Gotham. Here, the crime rate is soaring, its always night, and any daylight leaves you squinting. Its always downtown too; the city is inescapable, a confusing mix of the pedestrian and the paranoid.<br />For this sequel, theres a whole lot of story going on, which reduced to basics involves the wildly unpredictable Joker (Heath Ledger) wreaking havoc on Gotham. This perverse clowns keyword is chaos  crime without sense  and theres more than a nod to the post-9/11 order. Some men just want to watch the world burn, chips in one onlooker. Later, when a good guy turns bad and half his face is burnt to reveal bone and sinew, its hard not to recall those images of charred bodies in Iraq.<br />Ledger makes a great, freaky Joker, with dirty, lank hair, a voice that soars and dives, and a tongue that slithers and salivates. Two scenes stick in the mind: him walking away from a doomed hospital in a nurses dress right before an explosion, and later hanging out of the window of a speeding car, tasting the air like a reptile, with the soundtrack falling silent in tribute, freezing this psychotic, iconic villain in time and allowing for a moment of sadness amid the noise. If he wins an Oscar, whod begrudge him that tribute?<br /><br />Meanwhile, Christian Bales stately if unmemorable Bruce Wayne/Batman reassumes relationships with Michael Caines affable man-servant Alfred, Morgan Freemans man-sage Lucius Fox and Gary Oldmans modest cop, Lieutenant Gordon (whose quietness is drowned out by the films bombastics). New to the scene are District Attorney Harvey Dent (a slick Aaron Eckhart), who Wayne wants to promote as a human alternative to his vigilantism (an interesting sideline on the need for humility and choice when picking a leader), and Maggie Gyllenhaal as a replacement for Katie Holmess Rachel Dawes, but she barely gets a look-in. <br />Its all very monumental, and the films more self-conscious moments, of which there are many, would provoke a giggle if you werent distracted by yet another explosion, chase or ratcheting up of a score that shrieks importance.<br /><br />The challenge that Nolan has set himself is to make a comic book film thats serious, entertaining and popular. Its a tall order, but an admirable one. The Dark Knight is a film thats fantastic on the action front, seeds its acrobatics in its own reality, and always feels relevant even when its ideas are drowned out by clatter. That said, every once in a while, youd like to be able to lean into the screen and tickle somebodys ribs.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Disneys first 3D animation, made under new head John Lasseter, is a likeable, dynamic and seductively characterised family entertainment. Directed by newcomers Byron Howard and Chris Williams, its a romantic tale of the sentimental education of the titular dog, which is graphically inspired by the larger American shepherd and modestly voiced by John Travolta. In Truman Show fashion, Bolt is the deluded super-hero star of a hit live-action childrens television show, replete with a snazzy lightning logo emblazoned on his flank. As Bolt is separated by accident from his person, the equally innocent child-star Penny (Miley Cyrus), and joined by an alley-cat (a sassy, touching Susie Essman) and couch-potato Hamster (a cherishable star-turn by animator Mark Walton), he learns to be a real dog.<br />One of the pleasures of Bolt is how, without taking itself too seriously, it combines adventure with ideas and how the thoughtful, sympathetic script has fun with the reality/fantasy divide in a way that makes perfect sense to small kids, while still providing engagement and amusement for older siblings and adults in tow. Visually, its clever and stimulating: there are some excellent eye-level 3D effects, a nice pastiche of bullet-time (part of a running theme throughout the film discussing the relationship of live-action to CGI) and  elatingly  a pair of beautiful helicopter shots. Borrowing a practice from Pixar, the main feature is prefaced by a short film, one of car-dealers son Lasseters own CGI spin-offs from Cars, the lovely, Japanese-accented Tokyo Mater, which charmingly combines petrol-head nostalgia with Speed Racer-esque kineticism.]]></review>

Christian (Peter Marshall) has discovered that his teen daughter did a porn shoot the night she died of an overdose. Its decided: hell find the men involved. He has a bag of tools and a pit of rage. It may sound like torture porn, yet this low-budget debut is a different beast, a revenge thriller in the Peckinpah spirit. The carnage is gratuitously elaborate, yet mostly the expression of a mans anger at his own failings. Marshall captures the resolve and self-doubt beneath a mundane exterior, pushing proceedings towards flawed humanity over violent spectacle. Its mean and upsetting, but though the cruelty may undermine the message of vengeance breeding vengeance, its never presented as slickly enjoyable or a facile solution.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Geek falls for goddess in this opposites-attract US comedy. Kirk (Jay Baruchel, pictured below) works in airport security and dreams of being a pilot. He also dreams of dating a girl like Molly (Alice Eve, pictured below), who conveniently leaves her mobile at the airport. Returning it to sender, Kirk is stunned to be invited out and struggles to believe that Molly could possibly be interested in him over a series of mishap-riddled dates. Predictably, said mishaps include crude, gross-out comedy gags aimed squarely at 12-year-old lads. Less predictably, this has a decent stab at exploring the psychology of physically mismatched relationships. After a series of hunks, Molly is experimenting with inner beauty, while Kirk is plagued by low self-esteem after being dumped by his controlling ex.<br />Both leads have charm  Londoner Eve (daughter of Trevor, who has a cameo) easily passes for a glamorous American while Baruchel mixes the beguiling delivery of a young Christian Slater with an awkward gait and a hangdog expression. Hes nowhere near plain enough, but those whove seen the similarly themed but visually unappealing I Love You Beth Cooper will treat that as a blessing.<br />Its funny in parts: Kirks brash, socially inept pal Stainer (TJ Miller) amuses and Mollys bitchy best friend Pattie (Krysten Ritter) is great, while far prettier than anyone gives her credit for. Other supporting characters  including Kirks idiotic family  fall flat and fail to ring true. Shes Out of My League is uneven and frequently juvenile. But, like its hero, it has hidden depths  its just a shame theyre not allowed to shine.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Jaume Balaguer and Paco Plazas adequate but disappointing sequel to their terrifying Spanish horror movie picks up the action just minutes after the final night vision shot of TV presenter Angela (Manuela Velasco) being dragged off into the darkness. A four-man SWAT team enters the quarantined building alongside public health official Dr Owen (Jonathan Mellor), blissfully unaware of the virus-induced mayhem and infected crazies that await them. The audience, however, knows exactly what to expect, so despite a few neat surprises, [Rec] 2 mainly expands on familiar images and ideas.<br /><br />The sequels major innovation is the replacement of the originals single TV camera with the teams multiple-camera set-up. Bloody-faced zombies lunge at the camera, POV shots often resemble those in first-person shooter video games, and screens-within-screens display feeds from other parts of the building. This technology is used cleverly but not very effectively, boosting the amount of information without ramping up the suspense. Theres also a lot of tying up loose ends, which is clever in a puzzle-solving way, but undermines the sense of an anarchic plunge into chaos. <br />More contentiously, the supernatural/ religious element introduced towards the end of the first film is expanded here, pushing the sequel into Exorcist-style territory. Most damagingly, about 40 minutes in, the focus abruptly shifts to three irritating teens who have slipped into the house through the drains. This flabby mid-section only serves to deflate the tension and pad out the modest running time. One could drive a fire engine through the many plot holes, as [Rec] 2 does little more than fan the dying embers of the original.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The latest comic book to get a Hollywood going-over, The Losers, is a growling, paranoid graphic novel about a renegade military unit transformed into a 12-certificate bro-out. And it isnt half bad: unmemorable but fast and flashy, and less bloated than the kind of action number that keeps John Travolta in Lear jets. Plugging into the zeitgeist for films about dark forces pulling strings in government, it opens with the unit  still kosher  carrying out covert black ops. Theyre in Bolivia to do the CIAs (presumably illegal) bidding, taking out a drugs baron.<br /> Only when they arrive, the baron is using children as mules. Their handler, Max  the puppet master  orders them to strike regardless. Refusing, they come under attack from their own side, and presumed dead, disappear off into hiding promising payback. All the usual soldierly suspects are here: motormouth geek, family man, taciturn shooter, the really hard one  played perfectly decently by Chris Evans, Columbus Short, Oscar Jaenada and Idris Elba, with Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the colonel. Theres even a hot chick, Zo Saldana, who handles weapons like a trooper, sometimes in her knickers.<br />The Losers never stretches any of these stereotypes or hazards anything that might confound its audience. When the plot turns  as it inevitably must  to Max amassing a nuclear arsenal, were told he purchased them from the multinational-maker-of-everything. Funny, but its a reminder theres nothing new going on here. All of which might leave fans of the comic hankering for its foul-mouthed fatalism  when the prospect of going after the CIA gave one soldier the squirrelly shits. Here, its more like dude, wheres my AK?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A modest British romp gets a Hollywood makeover a mere two years later: whats the story there? Well, solid situation-comedy scenarios are obviously at a premium, so Craig Deans fairly traditional farce gets an LA redo, with Chris Rock and Martin Lawrence replacing Matthew Macfadyen and Rupert Graves as warring siblings enduring their fathers chaotic funeral. Hence, the humour takes an uptight social situation and unleashes serial indignities upon it  from mislabelled acid tablets, naked people, splattering bowel movements and even a mystery guest in the compact form of Peter Dinklage (the only actor in both versions). Some of this is crude, much of it predictable, but it is a crowd-pleaser, since director Neil LaButes performers willingly play it that bit broader, while an expanded budget brings a somewhat less poky feel. Although it still only just gets away with sundry homophobic and size-ist gags, theres a tad more zing than the original, though if you caught that already, be warned: this is a scene-for-scene retread.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Harvey Weinstein released cut versions of foreign films in America in the 90s; he called it art. Brett Ratner (Rush Hour series, X Men: The Last Stand) terms his Bollywood delve a remix. Confused? You will be on seeing this half an hour shorter version of the Hindi language is no barrier to love original. Ratners edited reboot is rather pointless given the fact that the slightly longer version is an accessible, engaging if unmemorable watch. Minor scenes which flesh out the characters and relationships and the unobstrusive songs on the soundtrack get the chop. Some cheesy English dialogue, a coy semi-nude encounter and noirish-type music are the replacement. The result is uncomplicated soft-core corn reflective of Ratners MTV style. Notable, but only for its novelty value. ]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In an immaculate record of his one-man show, the self-appointed superstud levels his sights against anyone who isn't black, male or Murphy. Women come in for more than their fair share of the offensive, as castrating bitches whose duty is to fuck husbands and cook burgers for hungry sons; the predatory infidelities of men, however, would seem excusable through Nature, Destiny, or simply because it's Okay with Eddie. Lisping gays, <i>Rocky</i>-obsessed Italians, whites in general, and Murphy's rivals are also subject to the foul-mouthed brew of complaint and contempt. It's impossible to deny the virtuosity of his non-stop delivery, but the relentless macho onslaught sadly lacks the saving grace of Richard Pryor's self-irony. Even if Murphy doesn't mean what he says (and he probably does), laughs are forestalled by the feeling that it's all too mechanically manipulative.]]></review>

The twist here is getting Navy SEALS <i>into</i> the rock to take the bastards <i>out. </i>Step forward as team-leaders reluctant heroes Cage, a Beatles-lovin' FBI boffin with chemical-weapons badges, and ex-SAS officer Sean Connery, the only man to escape from Alcatraz, and presently serving 30-odd years for obtaining US government secrets. Director Michael Bay (with only <i>Bad Boys</i> to his name) propels this brew of combat war-movie, <i>Die Hard</i>-style actioner and <i>Indiana Jones</i> adventure on enough octane to leave objections to the clichd dialogue and implausible of the plot in the slipstream. Fake countdown and knowing reactionary tone, but the best SF car chase to date.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This family comedy sees an eccentric nanny magically appearing to heal the naughty, troubled kids of a handsome widower. Unlike Mary Poppins, however, Nanny McPhee is ugly; grotesque even. But while barely recognisable, writer-star Emma Thompson gradually sheds the exaggerated prosthetics (hairy warts, bulbous nose, etc.) each time the children learn a valuable lesson. Quite why, nobody explains: the film barely acknowledges its supernatural themes.<br />That McPhee appears to use magic to control the kids is secondary to the more involving story of the potential romance between their father Mr Brown (Colin Firth) and the maid (Kelly Macdonald), their union impeded by Great Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury), who insists Brown marry a suitable bride. While contrived, this storyline introduces the films most humorous character: showy money-grabbing widow Mrs Quickly (Celia Imrie). But that Nanny McPhee herself is so unengaging undermines the films impact, making it pleasing but ultimately unsatisfying.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Science Fiction]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[Most of Werner Herzogs lead characters could plausibly tell you where I come from is the wild blue yonder, but this one (played by Brad Dourif) means it literally. As on-screen narrator of this science fiction fantasy, Dourif offers a rueful, embittered and often very funny account of his species journey, a century or so back, from their dying planet in the Andromeda system to Earth, where their grand plans for the establishment of a new civilisation foundered. To his outrage, vented against a backdrop of dust roads and ruined trailer parks, humans began to make their own way to the stars, even aiming for the frozen wonders of his abandoned home planet<br />Wild-eyed, straggly-haired and taking it all very personally, Dourifs turn recalls the to-camera addresses of Timothy Treadwell, posthumous star of Herzogs Grizzly Man. As in that film, the director makes substantial use here of found footage, illustrating the fantastical narrative with recontextualised archive material, some cheekily subverted but much of it  notably extended takes of space-station astronauts and antarctic scuba divers in their weirdly beautiful weightless environments  exploited for its sublime qualities, accentuated by a soundtrack of chanting and cello. A scientific context is offered by interviews with researchers expounding modes of intergalactic travel, but the real pleasures are in the organic beauty of deep spaces and the ambiguous position of the humans suspended in them.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Thrillers,  Romance]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[<p>The acting trio of Kristin Scott Thomas, Sergi Lpez and Yvan Attal add weight and interest to this French drama, which could easily have been a much more mundane study of the conflict between practicality and passion in love and marriage. As it is, Leaving plays it pretty straight and is rarely a very subtle affair, although director Catherine Corsini succeeds well in planting a seed of discomfort about the limits of romance and freedom that blossoms into full-blown cynicism by the end.</p><p><br />Scott Thomas plays English-born, French-speaking Suzanne, a well-off housewife training to return to work as a reflexologist in Nmes in southern France, where she lives in a stylish modern house with her husband Samuel (Attal) and two teenage kids. Samuel is an unlikeable presence, a successful businessman with many political and commercial links in the area, who casually jokes about his wifes economic powerlessness. Its that power, or lack of it, that becomes the films main concern when Suzanne gets closer and closer to Ivan (Lpez), a labourer they hire to help with renovations in their home and with whom she falls in love over the hacksaw and power drill.<br />Whats interesting about Leaving is that Suzannes affair is immediately presented as an anti-climax  at least when the first few climaxes are out of the way  even after she takes the bold step of leaving her husband and kids. Corsini gives Suzanne physical and emotional liberation with one hand, but slaps her back into reality with the other as she describes how Samuel blocks her bank account and exploits his local standing to make life equally difficult for the man whos cuckolded him. There are hints, too, that Ivan isnt so enraptured with Suzanne when shes not the monied, carefree person he first meets, which further douses the flames of the films amour fou.<br />Corsinis film sidesteps a simple tale of stricture and liberation and rails against the more conservative, less progressive strictures of marriage, accusing Suzanne and Ivan of creating a partnership which is unhealthy and unequal. Samuel is nothing less than the villain of the piece, and is fairly two-dimensional. But Suzanne isnt merely a victim: we also view her as naive and too willing to play the dutiful housewife to be able easily to step away from that role and play the independent free spirit.<br />I wonder whether the casting of a Spanish actor as Ivan and an English actress as Suzanne is coincidental? Clearly bad marriages are not national affairs, but the otherness of this pair shines a light on just how French Samuel is, with his peacock role in the home and the small-town, male-centred, quasi-Masonic way in which he operates within his community. Theres definitely a hint, via the casting, that Corsini is having a dig at some peculiarly French rituals and routines of marriage.<br />Scott Thomas is the main reason to see the film: she inhabits the strange contradictions and volatile changes of her character, even if shes given a couple of key scenes, such as one at a service station when she runs out of petrol and money, that dont ring true. The ending suggests a lack of ideas, but the journey is surprising enough for that not to matter.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It is, of course, a slice of pop genius, but it would be wrong to imagine that Serge Gainsbourgs accomplishments began and ended with 1968s chart-topping, multi-orgasmic Je TAime Moi Non Plus. Alt-rock aficionados revere the out-there flamboyance of his 1971 album LHistoire de Melody Nelson, yet, for the most part, Monsieur SG is a cult oddity this side of the Channel, while enjoying national treasure status on the other. For most British viewers, then, this lively biopic will be an education  and thankfully an entertainment as well. That said, given that generously hootered, gravel-voiced Gainsbourg managed to bed the likes of Juliette Greco, Brigitte Bardot and Jane Birkin, it would be tough to make a dull film about him.<br />Indeed, the fact that some key moments in Gainsbourgs career  the album with Jean-Luc Godard muse Anna Karina, the Lemon Incest single recorded with daughter Charlotte and his propositioning of Whitney Houston on a French TV chat show  all fail to make the final cut indicates no lack of juicy material. Instead the challenge for first-time writer-director Joann Sfar, known for his popular comic The Rabbis Cat, was to get under the skin of his subject, rather than detail every scandalous misadventure.<br />To a certain extent, Sfar succeeds, leaving us in no doubt of the lasting impression made on young Lucien Ginsburg by being forced to wear a yellow star in wartime Paris, where Nazi propaganda covered the streets with anti-Semitic grotesquerie. The films most daring move is to have one of these caricatures step down off the wall and become a life-size marionette which follows Gainsbourg around. However, instead of eating away at his confidence, La Gueule (The Mug) becomes a Tyler Durden-esque alter-ego prompting showbiz-aspirant Serge to further deeds of daring naughtiness. Yes, my boy, you shall shag Salvador Dals girlfriend on the artists sofa!<br />With chic animated interludes adding to the appeal, its clear theres an element of visual brio not found in every musical biopic, as this self-styled Vie Hroque happily encompasses sundry winning female performances (Anna Mouglalis as a slinky Ms Greco, Laetitia Casta as a voluptuous Bardot, the late Lucy Gordon as a gamine Miss Birkin) while happily spotlighting lookalike Eric Elmosninos convincingly addled incarnation of the title role.<br />A shame, then, that the film has already played its strongest cards by the end of the 60s, resulting in an all-too-familiar slide into ravaged self-caricature in its sketchy account of Gainsbourgs final decades. Its as if Sfar has run out of things to say, but while the movies on a roll, its zesty, engaging and frisky.]]></review>

thats essentially what we have hereafter a laughably amateurish intro
set in the 1920s, when the dice and cards are unearthed (in Turkey).
The friends that assemble on a modern-day Maine island to try it out
are uniformly obnoxious, and only the twin babysitters from Robert
Rodriguezs <i>Planet Terror</i> are recognizable. Soon enough, out
come the black, full-eye contact lenses and rental costumes. The
hi-def-video production looks made by people who havent seen <i>The Room</i>.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Undeterred by the lacklustre Shrek the Third, the series returns for a fourth film  and this time, its gone sci-fi. Shrek ends up in a parallel universe after tiring of the monotony of both fatherhood and local celebrity. In his current life, no one is scared of him, and busloads of tourists peer at the swamp home he shares with wife Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and their cute green babies. So Shrek goes awol and bumps into a wandering little guy called Rumpelstiltstkin.<br />As fairy-tale fans will know, Rumpelstiltskin specialises in tricksy contracts. So when Shrek drunkenly signs an agreement to be a real ogre for a day in return for just one day of his life, he doesnt realise the catch. Suddenly, Shrek is thrown into a world in which ogres are hated, but Rumpel rules the kingdom, hosting all-day raves with black-clad witches and routinely scamming the quivering inhabitants of a depleted Far Far Away.<br />All very Back to the Future II, and its a fun twist that allows for a fresh perspective on familiar characters. Fiona is now a warrior princess, Donkey is a slave to the witches, and Puss? Well, lets just say hes been living the good life. The plots initially involving  and if its too complex for toddlers, it compensates with humour, visual invention and a 3D wow factor. This cant match the originals laugh count, though, and the story wears thin. Still, with warmth and charm, Shrek Forever After is an entertaining conclusion to the franchise  one that parents should happily endure. But lets hope thats all, folks.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Re-teaming Jack Lemmon, scriptwriter Iz Diamond and director Billy Wilder the year after Some Like it Hot, this multi-Oscar-winning comedy is sharper in tone as it traces the compromises of a New York insurance drone who uses his brownstone apartment as promotional capital by pimping it out, as it were, for his married bosses illicit affairs. <br />This quintessential New York movie  with its exquisite design by Alexander Trauner and shimmering black-and-white photography  presented something of a breakthrough in its presentation of the sex-war in the age of the organisation man, with its sour and cynical view of the immoralism, self-deception, loneliness and cruelty involved in romantic liaisons. <br />Directed by Wilder with a professional fluidity, attention to detail and emotional reticence that belie its inherent darkness and melodramatic core, its lifted considerably by the performances: the psychosomatic ticks and tropes of Lemmon as the poor nebbish balanced by the pathos of Shirley MacLaine as the abused lift girl. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Scatological grue, nudity, swearing, drug-taking and the chance to watch two grown men wrestle a midget Despite the Farrelly accoutrements, Frank Ozs first film in three years since his clunking remake of The Stepford Wives plays it safe to remain a very British comedy  contained, modestly amusing and guaranteed not to offend your mother. Parking his drawing-room farce at a country-house funeral, Dean Craigs schematic screenplay invites an eccentric group of family and friends  all good breeding and bad language  and duly cranks them, with increasing mania, through a series of overlapping disaster set-ups. The son (Matthew Macfadyen) is a wannabe writer sweating his eulogy in the shadow of his hotshot novelist brother (Rupert Graves). The mourning widow (Jane Asher) is primed to crack at any moment. The cousins (Daisy Donovan) attempts to make her disapproving father (Peter Egan) warm to fianc (Alan Tudyk) arent helped with he accidentally pops a hallucinogenic party pill.</p><p>You get the picture: complications, confusion, desperation and embarrassment, all spiked with a twist of blackmail. Right at home with energetic slapstick (see Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and What About Bob?), Oz can roll out this sort of frantic, stagey comedy in his sleep  and so he does. But, thanks to a streak of dark mirth, the result is predictable but rarely dull. Showboating roles go to the Americans, with Tudyk gurning heroically throughout the entire film and Peter Dinklage pulling an effortless cameo as the obligatory mystery guest with a dark secret.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Although its pervasive religious imagery suggests that it is reaching for an epic sweep that constantly eludes its grasp, Training Day director Antoine Fuquas latest cop movie features some impressively acted scenes. The melodramatic screenplay by first-time writer Michael Martin interweaves three parallel stories, painting an intimate portrait of three contrasting cops, whose individual fates eventually converge in one project building late one night. <br />The long shadow of The Wire falls across the scenes set inside the East Brooklyn projects, where undercover cop Clarence Butler (Don Cheadle) is suffering an identity crisis while passing himself off as streetwise ex-con Tango, right-hand man to drug kingpin Casanova Caz Phillips (Wesley Snipes). Self-loathing narcotics cop Sal (Ethan Hawke) is wrestling with his Catholic conscience, considering stealing drug-bust money to make a down payment on the dream house hes promised his careworn pregnant wife, Angela (Lili Taylor), and their kids. After 22 time-serving years on the street, alcoholic beat cop Eddie Dugan (Richard Gere) is one week away from retirement, but has been forced to babysit a wide-eyed rookie in one of the citys most dangerous districts.<br />Made for a modest $17 million, Fuquas gritty character study offers a surprisingly intimate portrait of the three doomed cops who have sacrificed much to serve and protect the citizens of the crime-ridden projects and received precious little money or respect in return. Nevertheless, a well-directed cast, which also includes Will Patton and Ellen Barkin  as well as Hassan Iniko Johnson and Michael K Williams, who played Wee-Bay and Omar in The Wire  can only breathe so much new life into the hackneyed story elements.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Out of the shadows of Mamma Mia! creeps this hysterically silly, sun-soaked yarn of love lost and found in Italy with a story that feels like its been scribbled on the side of a jar of Ragu and an approach to filming Italy thats been nicked from an old Cornetto ad. Sophie (Amanda Seyfried; yes, this wants to be Mamma Mia! without songs) is a lowly fact-checker at The New Yorker who takes a pre-wedding trip to Verona with her restaurateur boyfriend Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal, smiling and waving his hands about like a nutter). But, once in Europe, Gael is off snouting for truffles and Sophie is left to discover a cadre of writers who ritually reply to notes left at the citys shrine to Shakespeares Juliet. Soon, Sophie is penning one such note herself to Claire (Vanessa Redgrave, distinguished amid the nonsense), an elderly Brit whose letter to an Italian sweetheart has been sitting behind a brick for decades. And what do you know? Claire turns up to search the Italian countryside with Sophie for her long-lost Lorenzo  along with her grumpy hunk of a grandson, Charlie (Christopher Egan, actually Australian, which explains why he acts like a surfboard).<br />Is there any point wondering why some of these actors ignored the script and agreed to spend several weeks working in the glorious Italian countryside? But thank heavens for small mercies: someone must have realised in the edit that they might have a kitsch classic on their hands as theres at least a knowing sense of camp alongside the dire performances and corny plotting.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[By virtue of its subject matter, and of the prodigious effort that has gone into its production, <i>Gandhi</i> has to be considered one of the major British films of the year. Its subject is an Indian spiritual leader almost unknown to today's Western youth, who not only preached a more sophisticated and forceful version of the pacifist ethic than ever flowered in the '60s, but succeeded in using it to help liberate his country and change its political history. Of course the film raises more questions than it comes near to answering, but its faults rather pale beside the epic nature of its theme, and Kingsley's performance in the central role is outstanding.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In which we learn, once more, that you can take utter tosh, douse it in classical music and  voil!  youve got classy tosh masquerading as something meaningful. At the famous Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, office cleaner Andrei (Aleksei Guskov) picks up a fax from the Chtelet Theatre in Paris: the LA Phil has cancelled, can the Bolshoi step in? Leaving aside the likelihood that agents would be handling these details, or indeed the sheer implausibility of such arrangements being handled solely by fax, its a tempting opportunity for Andrei, a once-brilliant conductor whose career was halted during the Brezhnev era for hiring Jewish musicians. So, a daring plan emerges as he rounds up his old orchestral pals and heads off to Paris posing as the Bolshoi band.<br />To be fair, much of this is played as bumbling comedy, but while laughter at the expense of Soviet apparatchiks, snooty French arts administrators and boozy Russian ensembles on tour is fair enough, the broad treatment of Andreis Romany fixer and his light-fingered cohorts proves more uncomfortable. As the high-jinks begin to drag, director Radu Mihaileanu gamely shovels on old-fashioned melodrama, since the conductors also driven by the redemptive prospect of salving painful family wounds. Thankfully, Mlanie Laurents persuasive contribution as a glam violin soloist comes as a welcome break from Guskovs one-note Russian melancholy, while the crisply shot climactic performance of Tchaikovskys Violin Concerto musters enough dash to mask previous failings of credibility, taste and coherence. Resounding applause notwithstanding, theres still much here thats simply off-key.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
Jeffrey (MacLachlan) is the contemporary knight in slightly tarnished armour, a shy and adolescent inhabitant of Lumberton, USA. After discovering a severed ear in an overgrown backlot, he embarks upon an investigation that leads him into a hellish netherworld, where he observes - and comes to participate in - a terrifying sado-masochistic relationship between damsel-in-distress Dorothy (Rossellini) and mad mobster Frank Booth (Hopper). Grafting on to this story his own idiosyncratic preoccupations, Lynch creates a visually stunning, convincingly coherent portrait of a nightmarish substratum to conventional, respectable society. The seamless blending of beauty and horror is remarkable - although many will be profoundly disturbed by Lynch's vision of male-female relationships, centred as it is on Dorothy's psychopathic hunger for violence - the terror very real, and the sheer wealth of imagination virtually unequalled in recent cinema.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The third Astaire-Rogers movie (not counting <i>Flying Down to Rio</i>) and one of the best, with a superlative Irving Berlin score (it includes 'No Strings', 'Isn't This a Lovely Day?', 'Top Hat, White Tie and Tails' and 'Cheek to Cheek'), and equally superlative Hermes Pan routines which spark a distinct sexual electricity between the pair. Oddly enough, the film is almost slavishly patterned on <i>The Gay Divorcee</i>, with the scene again shifting from London to a resort (Venice in this case), the plot again turning on mistaken identity, and the comedy again reliant on Horton, Blore and Rhodes. The reason you don't really notice this - with <i>Top Hat</i> readily springing to mind as the archetypal Fred'n'Ginger movie - is the booster given by Van Nest Polglase's stunning white Art Deco designs, which were to set the tone for the series.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Terry Jones scripted this fairy tale fantasy in which pubescent Connelly must negotiate the myriad dangers of a mazy goblin city and cross the Bog of Eternal Stench to reclaim her baby brother from the talons of Goblin King Bowie. If the narrative's an enthusiastic assemblage of elements from the likes of Maurice Sendak and Frank L Baum, Henson's Creature Shop were on hand to provide the necessary, and rather impressive supporting cast of assorted gnomes and pixies. Still, although the film's initial energy and engaging finale are rather muffled by a mid-section that spends too much time idling in neutral, you can at least wonder at David Bowie's saddest ever haircut (no mean achievement) and bask in the pleasurable sight of an ill-tempered gnome scornfully squishing sweet little fairy creatures underfoot.]]></review>

Together with snooty sidekick Archimedes the owl, Merlin educates the boy in some of the basic facts of life. With his magic wand, he can change both himself and his pupil into anything he wishes, which results in one of the best episodes: a duel between Merlin and the evil witch Madam Mim, where they both try to gain the upper hand by transforming themselves into some of the nastiest creatures possible. It was produced by Walt himself, with tuneful music supplied by the Sherman brothers.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This extremely assured directorial debut from Sofia Coppola finds an unexpected perspective on what should by rights be difficult subject matter - teenage suicide. Adapting Jeffrey Eugenides' best-seller, Francis Coppola's daughter tells the story of the Lisbon sisters - five delicious blondes who set teenage hormones raging in Grosse Point, Michigan, some 20-odd years ago. On her second suicide attempt, Cecilia impales herself on the railings outside the house. In the ensuing months, the remaining (older) sisters cast a troubling shadow over the neighbourhood, especially for the boys at school. Kept on a tight leash by their religious parents (Turner and Woods, both cast against type and underplaying effectively), the girls come to represent the intangible mysteries and sorrows of all women. As a rule of thumb, one should approach any movie constructed around a metaphor with caution. Nevertheless, Coppola casts quite a spell. She has a deft sense of composition and a great ear for music (particularly an original ambient score by Air). The tone of wistful regret and longing doesn't preclude a good deal of gentle humour. It's a restrained, subtly suggestive piece which disintegrates if you try to get a fix on it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[All you Concerned of Actons can put down those Biros and half-cocked sawn-offs right now: yes, two stars for one of the Greatest Films of All Time may seem a little derisive, but what a time to reissue this bleak and emotionally manipulative (sorry, poignant) vision of humanity crushed under the jackboot of destitution and economic downturn! Celebrating its sixtieth, De Sicas neo-realist lodestone may have retained its vitality over the decades, but whatever sense of anger it whipped up in the disgruntled masses of postwar Rome feels lost to the excessively syrupy score and doe-eyed kid sidekick. Sure, the stark location shooting and a yearning central performance from Lamberto Maggiorani  a regular stiff who needs to get his stolen bike back  are beautifully measured, but the laissez-faire approach to metaphor jettisons detail in favour of broader commentary. Why not seek out a DVD of something like The Treasure of the Sierra Madre  also 60 this year  to really stoke those feelings of withering disenfranchisement?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Soul-stirring celebration or crass cultural exploitation? Truth is, The Blues Brothers is a bit of both, lending exposure to rhythm and blues legends  who might otherwise have faded into silence while at the same time treating black culture as a colourful pantomime backdrop for the antics of two white comedians. That Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi adore this music is not in question  its lovingly chosen and brilliantly performed  but the film sometimes feels like a work of cultural tourism, particularly in scenes set in a gospel church and a Chicago street market. These lively musical sequences also sit awkwardly with director John Landiss bizarre predilection for wholesale destruction: sure, smashing up cop cars can be fun, but Landis takes things to a tiresome extreme. Still, the film retains a huge nostalgic kick, thanks in large part to Aykroyd and Belushis easy rapport, a smattering of daft, shaggy humour  and some truly iconic musical sequences.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A dazzling <i>film noir</i> out of the same paranoiac mould as <i>Klute</i>. It begins with classic murder as a girl's body is stuffed into a trash-can one stormy night. When the killer is tentatively identified as a fat-cat oil tycoon, stern retribution against the powers who never pay for their sins is demanded by Cutter (Heard), a horribly mutilated Vietnam veteran who hounds the tycoon to his doom, guilty or not. But the quixotic Cutter is gradually transformed into an Ahab pursuing his Moby Dick, and the hallucinatory quality of the film comes from its view of California as a paradise turned into a hunting-ground for the leviathans of speculation. As three minnows threshing desperately to avoid being engulfed, Cutter, his drunken wife (Eichhorn), and his beach-bum best friend (Bridges) are caught in a nightmarish personal triangle of extraordinary, constantly shifting complexity, rippling with secrecies and ambivalent emotions that escape easy definition. Amazing performances from Heard, Bridges and Eichhorn in one of the key films of the decade.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
Taking elements of both the Western and the British horror film, Peckinpah's masterstroke was to shoot <i>Straw Dogs</i> absolutely straight, without the reassuring signposts of either type of film. Hoffman's American mathematician settles with his wife in the village where she grew up, encountering first hostility, then violence from the remote, backward (inbred?) Cornish community. 'Civilised' man's confrontation with irrational violence is handled with impeccable logic. Indeed, looking back, it's hard to see what the charges of gratuitous violence were all about. More intriguing and questionable is Peckinpah's total annihilation of Hoffman's marriage. The violence that befalls it can be interpreted partly as an externalisation of the couple's latent incompatibility (stressed again and again). But the ensuing mixture of fantasy wish fulfilment and pure terror seems more informed by a general misogyny than specific doubts about that particular relationship.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Punky 17-year-old Randy Dean (Hollomon) is having a desultory affair with a married woman, lives with her aunt in a 'regular lesbo household', and daydreams to the strains of Zeppelin and Hendrix. Evie Roy (Parker) is a glamorous, well-to-do African-American who lives with her mum, prefers Mozart and Walt Whitman, and is getting tired of her insensitive, immature boyfriend. Though they're both in their senior year at the same high school they don't meet until Evie's car starts giving her trouble and she calls in at the garage where Randy works. Still, it's an encounter that will change their lives. This feature debut offers a perky look at the trials of first love as experienced by two very different girls from two very different backgrounds. If there's nothing hugely original about the story, there's a lot of charm here, thanks largely to the easy naturalism of the performances. This is such a conventional telling of a modern-day fairy story that its (vaguely) subversive content should offend virtually no one. There's tenderness, humour, lyricism and a heartfelt plea for universal tolerance; and if the farcical finale seems obvious and contrived, it's hard to resist a movie so gentle that its most shocking transgression is the unwitting wasting of a bottle of Chteau Latour.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Franju's superbly elegant and enjoyable tribute to the adventure fanatasies of Louis Feuillade sees the eponymous righter-of-wrongs (Pollack) abduct a wicked banker in order to prevent villainess Diana (Berg, glorious in black cat suit) laying her hands on a fortune the banker's daughter (Scob) is due to inherit. Cue for a magical clash between good and evil, with the director revelling in poetic symbolism (the opening masked ball finds our hero, with forbidding bird mask, creating a dove out of thin air), black-and-white photography that thrills with its evocation of a lost, more innocent era, and surreal set pieces.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A wonderfully upfront narrative rendered in garish primary colours, this discursive update of <i>The Blue Angel</i> poses Lola (Sukowa) and the blue-eyed trembling-pillar-of-rectitude building commissioner who helplessly falls for her (Mueller- Stahl) as barometers of the moral bankruptcy at the heart of Germany's post-war 'economic miracle'. Lola (owned, like most of the city, by Mario Adorf's bluffly sleazy building profiteer) threads sinuously through the civic corruption of reconstruction, accruing sufficient manipulative credit to buy a slice of the status quo, seductively scuttling several shades of idealism with the oldest of come-on currencies. Business as usual. The prostitution metaphors come undiluted from early Godard, the poster-art visuals from the magnificent melodramas of Sirk and Minnelli; the provocations are all Fassbinder's own.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In one of the most gorgeous images in Volver, white blossoms into crimson as a sheet of kitchen towel saturates with blood. Housework here is murder and a womans work is never done  not after killing, not even after dying. Almodvar has long been interested in the varied terrain of womens troubles (as the films funniest line ambiguously describes them), and his sixteenth feature returns to many of the concerns of his fourth, 1984s What Have I Done To Deserve This?, offering another fable of long-suffering drudgery overcome by domestic homicide and the whiff of quotidian magic (and bodily odours). Its one of several returns to which the title  meaning coming back  refers, along with the road from Madrid to ancestral La Mancha, the irruption of the past into the present and Almodvars professional reunion with Carmen Maura for the first time since Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (1987).The story is at once hysterical and mundane, founded in abuse, rape, murder and corpse disposal yet ultimately about none of these so much as the endurance of those involved. Penlope Cruz steps into the pivotal role taken by Maura in What Have I Done: her Raimunda is a working wife and mum holding down several jobs to support her adolescent daughter Paula (Yohana Cobo). She also makes regular trips back to her home village with her sister Sole (Lola Dueas) to tend their mothers grave and visit their aged aunt (regular Almodvar biddie Chus Lampreave). But when Raimundas husband suddenly dies and Sole starts receiving visitations from their mum (Maura), both have to learn to live with death and the practical as well as emotional challenges it brings.Looking back, Almodvars career is extraordinarily cohesive, a decade-spanning conversation of images and emotions rendered through ever more sophisticated technique, especially in narrative terms: as always, he makes room here for jealousy and self-reinvention, shoes and hospitals, patterns and mirrors, embedded clips of classic films and pastiches of trash TV, but juxtaposes and frames them with more delicacy and grace than ever  its some achievement that the film is both funnier and more moving on repeated viewing, when its pervasive dramatic ironies emerge. Where the directors earliest works alternated tragedy and farce, Volver masterfully interpolates them: the absurd and the affecting rub along with marvellous, deceptive ease, recalling The Trouble with Harry one minute, Babettes Feast the next. Vintage Magnani and Loren, meanwhile, are explicitly evoked in Cruzs bravura performance.The construction of glamour (another perennial Almodvar trope) lies at the root of the original sins blighting this family  sins played out in the mad desert garden of their home village. Almodvar is a native of La Mancha himself and his characters return to the social womb has provoked various and complex emotions in his films. The village here is superstitious and somewhat alien  a funeral scene yields eerie, segregated scenes of silent, staring men and a hive of black-clad women awash in the buzz of prayer and clicking of fans  riven by a tearing wind that supposedly fuels insanity as well as ravenous fires. (The frequent shots of modern windmills bring to mind the regions most famous and delusional scion, Don Quixote.)That the location proves to be restorative as well as traumatic is down to the air of sympathetic sisterhood embodied in the superb ensemble acting (Blanca Portillo is terrific as the sisters childhood friend). More even than All About My Mother, this is a world of absentee men and multi-tasking women unfettered by conventional expectations  including those of the genre narrative Volver initially seems to offer. Time and again the expected development is described rather than shown, or finessed away entirely. The result is to bind us more closely to the characters than the plot in a testament to Almodvars ideal  perhaps idealised  vision of female solidarity. If that kitchen towel shot turned housework into a fight for life, the gorgeous closing credit sequence makes the mundane miraculous, as patterns from the characters everyday clothes bloom into screen-filling beauty.]]></review>

Larrys first experience is being pursued by a the skeletal remains of a T-Rex, and at this point the film looks like it could be quite a hoot. But it all goes pear-shaped as soon as an Easter Island statue cracks an insipid joke and the Neanderthals start grunting. According to former security officers Dick Van Dyke and Mickey Rooney, an ancient Egyptian tablet is to blame. So, with the help of Robin Williams waxwork Teddy Roosevelt, Owen Wilsons miniaturised cowboy and his nemesis, Steve Coogans inch-high Octavius, Larry sets out to restore calm The special effects for this Jumanji-esque fantasy must have cost a bomb. A shame, then, that the result is such an aimless and riotous mess.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This feature-length documentary about iconic artworld grand dame Louise Bourgeois was filmed over 14 years (between 1993-2007), but its an investment that has paid off by producing an unexpectedly lyrical and poetic portrait of the now 98-year-old, feisty, French-American artist, acclaimed for her psychologically-charged sculptures that include room-like cells and giant spiders. What comes across is an artist who epitomises the genuine article  for whom neither life nor art could exist without the other and whose creativity has nothing to do with a desire for fame and everything to do with a need to express powerful emotions and ideas in a way that is both personal and universal. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Director Iain Softley  who more than earned his spurs with his sterling 1997 adaptation of Henry Jamess The Wings of the Dove  relishes the task of bringing German author Cornelia Funkes quaint adventure novel to the screen, drawing a clutch of charismatic and amusingly hammy performances from his predominantly British cast while gently espousing the pleasures of reading. <br />Like last years guilty pleasure Enchanted, Inkheart plays on the fantastical possibilities of an overlap between fiction and reality, homing in on actor Brendan Fraser, who yet again essays another of his affable khaki academics. He plays a Silvertongue  no, not a stalwart on the regional blue comedy circuit  someone with the ability to bring the written word to life when he reads out aloud. Problems arise when he inadvertently unleashes the megalomaniacal Capricorn (Andy Serkis as an amalgam of Gollum and a camp Bond villain) into the world while simultaneously incarcerating his wife into the pages of the titular novel. <br />Setting off on a Euro-jaunt with his daughter Meggie (Eliza Bennett) in order to locate a rare volume of Inkheart and undo his myriad supernatural wrongs, he gathers a retinue of variously concerned/ angered conscripts (Helen Mirren, Jim Broadbent and Paul Bettany  all enjoyable), whose characters represent the facets of the fiction world, from the collector to the author to the endearing fictional side-player whos eventually doomed to death. Its a familiar tale, but one told with gusto, wit and visual flare; of particular note is the dilapidated Germanic fortress where Capricorn and his cronies reside, which looks like it was plucked straight from the warped minds of a Gilliam or a del Toro.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Come to Hoxton! Frequent its many crowded, piss-stained sinkholes! Enjoy live entertainment from the hottest purveyors of whimsical folktronic sludge! Sleep in an authentic loft-space art-squat and have sex with pretty polyamorous pop-kids! Feel the achingly disinterested urban ennui leaking from every crack in the filthy, rain-soaked pavement! Because despite being young, staggeringly attractive and economically carefree in the worlds greatest city, the characters in Unmade Beds are still, yknow, searching for, like, meaning and stuff. <br />Spanish squatter Axl (Fernando Tielve) is looking for his English dad. Fey French drifter Vera (Dborah Francois) is hunting for love. And surrounding them are a cavalcade of miscellaneous Eurotrash hipsters, alternately drinking themselves blind, shagging themselves senseless or reflecting on the wondrous misery that is their lives. Theres real promise in Unmade Beds: the photography is luminous, the direction loose but involving, the acting superb. But ultimately its a joyless, indulgent film about joyless, indulgent people, trying way too hard to be cool and consistently missing the point.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A drug town with a tourist problem, jokes one of Jez Lewiss interviewees about Hebden Bridge, the picturesque West Yorkshire town where Lewis grew up and an alarming number of friends and acquaintances have killed themselves or dedicated their lives to drink and drugs. Lewis is a producer who worked with Nick Broomfield on Ghosts, and his first film as a director is a personal work  painful for him; distressing for us  for which the 42 year old, prompted by the overdose of a friend, revisits Hebden over a year and films pals new and old as they go about their lives. We spend time with Cass, an alcoholic and one of Lewiss oldest friends; Silly, an ex-soldier and also an alcoholic; and Liam, a scaffolder and heroin user who lives with his mum and lost a younger brother to drink a few months earlier. <br />Nobody seems to care when Lewis films them drinking their days away. If there were quibbles over his presence, Lewis omits them, just as he wisely leaves out any scenes of hard drug use. This is the sort of sympathetic yet not entirely forgiving film only a friend could make: Lewis wants answers but cares too much about his subjects to denigrate them with platitudes. The tragedy of Lewiss sensitive and sensible film is that most of its subjects are as aware as us of the rut in which they are stuck. Most dont deny that they could be next to die. Some even seem to will it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Plan A was for Bruno (Vignau) to get his ex-girlfriend back by asking. That didnt work, so its on to plan B: hell make her new boyfriend, Pablo (Ferraro), fall in love with him. The gender divide is clearly narrower in this Argentinian neighbourhood than it generally is in London  young men have female friends, and homosexuality is the object of curiosity rather than scorn  but this still feels like a pretty silly premise, and the charming friendship that develops between the two men is marred by its idiotic beginnings as well as by the films funereal pace. The acting, however, is superb: in long takes, Vignau overcomes our dislike of his double dealing while Ferraro displays a sweet vulnerability that could make anyone, male or female, want to kiss him better.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Writer/director Nicole Holofceners sharp talky comedies can seem neither fish nor fowl: too Woody Allen for chick flick, too earthy for arthouse. Its true of her latest, Please Give, which has Catherine Keener as retro furniture dealer Kate, who sells mid-twentieth-century classics out of her Manhattan shop. We buy it from the children of dead people, says her husband (Oliver Platt) sarcastically. Theyve also just bought the flat next door from neighbour Andra (Ann Morgan Guilbert), a cantankerous nonagenarian, with the proviso that she stays put until she dies. Rebecca Hall plays Andras grandaughter, a mammogram technician, and the film opens with a bouncy montage of boobs being slapped down on her X-ray machine.<br />Kate is a character recognisable from Holofceners previous films (Lovely &amp; Amazing, Friends with Money): shes wracked with the frustrations only money and a New Yorker subscription can buy. She feels like a vulture circling Andra waiting for her to die and shes guilty about the extortionate mark-ups in her shop. So she dishes out $20 notes to homeless men and in some ruthlessly hilarious scenes takes up volunteering  a group of kids with Downs syndrome playing basketball reduce her to a pathetic flood of tears.<br />With smug neediness on this scale, Holofceners biggest ally against nauseating self-pity is Keener, her screen alter ego  shes appeared in all four of her films. Keener does messy contradictions like no other actress; she is also, of course, the 50 year old every woman wants to grow up to be. Holofceners writing is unnervingly observant. When it looks like Kates husband is chasing after Andras other grandaughter (Amanda Peet), another writer would play him as a sleaze or her as a man-eater. Here its more banal, a shoddy affair of convenience; realistic, just like those X-rayed boobs.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A glossy, Hitchcock-by-numbers thriller, with Douglas as a happily married New York attorney whose clandestine weekend of passion with business associate Close provokes the wrath of a woman scorned when he tries to give her the brush-off. Angered by his insensitive chauvinism, Close becomes increasingly unhinged, progressing from insistent phone calls to acid attacks on Douglas' car, and finally to physical attacks on his family. Lyne employs the same flashy imagery as in <i>Nine 2 Weeks</i>, but his overheated visual style seems curiously inappropriate to James Dearden's tepid script. The film finally comes to the boil in the brilliantly staged, crowd-pleasing finale - a nail-biting showdown between a knife-wielding Close, a frightened wife and an enraged Douglas. A predictable dog's dinner of Pavlovian thriller clichs, this will appeal strongly to those who think women should be kept on a short lead.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Medical school student Nelson Wright (Sutherland) is so obsessed with research into the near-death experience that he recruits four friends, and they take turns at stopping their hearts until the monitors reading their vital signs indicate nothing but flat lines. Once revived by other members of the team, armed with their new-found knowledge they set about rectifying past misdeeds. Schumacher's aggressive direction sweeps across weird panoramas and dives headlong into terrifying memories. We're in mystical territory here, hence the flamboyant visuals; but that's no excuse for Peter Filardi's affected script, which culminates in Bacon railing against the heavens, fists and feet flying. There's also a sorry lack of restraint from production designer Eugenio Zanetti, whose other-worldly atmosphere reaches its apotheosis in Sutherland's all-white apartment, which contains only one piece of furniture (a bed, of course).]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Wes Craven draws on a shared pop cultural heritage in horror flicks to fashion this bloody brand of post-modern comedy. 'So you like scary movies? Name the killer in <i>Friday the 13th</i>?' demands the anonymous caller of Barrymore's lone teen in the prologue. 'Hang up again and I'll gut you like a fish!' The killer describes his apparently irrational vendetta against the high school population of Woodsboro as a game, and in this he's surely speaking for screenwriter Kevin Williamson and director Craven, who kill off the clichs and all the wrong characters with panache. At times, it's too clever, but it's sure scary, with the jokes notching up the general level of hysteria. As a bonus, Craven throws in half a dozen of Hollywood's brightest hopefuls: Campbell in the central role of the teenager haunted by the murder of her mother; Arquette as a naive local deputy; Cox as a TV star; McGowan as the doomed best friend; and Ulrich as the evocatively named Billy Loomis. Intelligence, wit and sophistication - at last, a horror movie to shout about!]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA['I'm a minor character in my own story,' complains Tony Wilson, music impresario, club owner, and living legend within the Granada TV region. The film-makers pack in so much, from the Sex Pistols in 1976 to the birth of the rave scene at the Hacienda club in the late 1980s, it's difficult to know where to start - but Wilson is the common link. He was in the right place at the right time, and, crucially, he had the good sense to know it. Snugly personified here by Coogan, Wilson comes off as a pragmatic dreamer, an idealistic opportunist with an eye for the genius of anarchy and accident. All of which makes him a lively, unreliable guide to the tangled roots of Madchester. The merry casting, too, throws up a dozen memorable vignettes (best of all, Sean Harris, intense and haunting as Joy Division's Ian Curtis). Encouraging improvisation and shooting on DV, Winterbottom has come up with a raucous and unruly mob of a movie, which pulls this way and that with drunken abandon, stepping on toes left and right, stumbling more than once, probably pissing all over the floor with the facts, but always having a high old time.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Banned in Ireland until this decade  as if in honour of James Joyces similarly treated source novel  blacklisted director Joseph Stricks 1967 adaptation presents a pretty picture of garrulous and gabby 1960s Dublin. That said, the sacred poetry of the 1904-set novel is much muted. As a director, Strick, this month the subject of a Barbican retrospective, veered from the sober to the fanciful, and in this film his care and fidelity tend to shroud the action in a cloak of sepulchral reverence as he charts the wanderings of Jewish ad man Leopold Bloom. Nevertheless, theres much to appeal in this miniature odyssey, notably the superb black-and-white location work of Get Carter lensman Wolfgang Suschitzky and the seductive turns of a range of Irish, American and British players, headed by Milo OSheas innocent drifter and Barbara Jeffords adulterous armful, Molly.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[While Mesrine: Death Instinct chronicled the ascendancy of Vincent Cassels cocksure French crim, Jacques Mesrine, this second chapter ditches the mechanics of his life story in favour of a ruminative, often unsympathetic inspection of his contradictory character traits (as reflected in an ever-changing wardrobe of disguises). The early stages hint at a Heat-like battle of wits between Mesrine and tireless police commissioner Broussard (Oliver Gourmet), but a last-minute escape from justice puts the spotlight back on Cassel. The film continues as a wandering  account of how Mesrines various antics and encounters shaped him as a person. Unlike its more lively predecessor, this is more interested in dissecting the criminal mindset and proposes the theory that the acts of a felon prevent him or her from being able to maintain logical personal and political ideals.

      <review><![CDATA[Bergman won his first Oscar for this cruel but unsensational medieval allegory, a tale of superstition, religious faith, rape and revenge set in a 14th century Sweden where the populace is vacillating between Christianity and paganism. On her way to church, the 15-year-old virgin daughter (Pettersson) of peasant parents (von Sydow and Valberg) is raped by two goatherds. Later, in a bizarre twist of fate, the culprits ask for food and shelter at the house of the dead girl's parents. Discovering the truth when the goatherds offer to sell them their dead daughter's bloodstained clothes, the parents exact a brutal revenge. The formal simplicity and overt symbolism (light and dark, fire and water) undercut the potentially sensationalist elements of the material, Sven Nykvist's luminous black-and-white photography conspiring with the austerity of Bergman's imagery to create an extraordinary metaphysical charge.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The original <i>Time Out</i> review of Sergio Leones conceited and long-winded eulogy to the passing of Americas frontier days claimed that Peckinpahs Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid was its only rival when it came to the title of best western ever. How times have changed. Once Upon a Time now looks like an over-cooked mess of style, metaphor and reference, while Pat strides ahead, every bit the poetic modern masterpiece. Charles Bronson is the squinty cipher pitted against a countercast Henry Fonda in a tale of bloody revenge that takes numerous detours into areas of property law and corporate malaise, only to conclude with the displacement of man (the humble cowpoke) by his distant, cold-hearted brethren, the businessman. In technical terms, scenes such as the operatic opening shoot-out are hard to fault,but this is a film that rewards the eyes and ears without properly considering the heart and head.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of the finest movies of the '90s, as unforgettable as it is improbable. And it is improbable - in fact it sounds more like a gag than a putative masterpiece: Morris takes a lion tamer, a robot inventor, a topiarist and an expert on the mole rat, cutting between these self-confessed obsessives (and clips from old B serials) with a juggler's flamboyant skill. The carnivalesque score and Robert Richardson's characteristically eye-popping cinematography make it all the more disorienting. Entertaining as it is, you have to wonder how Morris can possibly draw it all together. When he does, it's on the most profound philosophical level, as the film engages with questions of what it is that distinguishes human consciousness from animal and artificial (and vegetable) varieties. Dazzling.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Shorn of its rusticity, simplicity, the involvement of the original story's author, and, for much of the film, Cromwell's anchoring Farmer Hoggett, <i>Babe 2</i> has lost its innocence and much of its appeal. Instead of sheepdog trials, there is massive set design; a zoo-full of CGI and animatronically enhanced vignettes; a familiar, if expensively mounted, series of chases; mayhem; imperilment; and a needless clown act by Rooney. Disappointment sets in early, when Farmer Hoggett is disabled fixing the well. To save the farm, Mrs Hoggett and the pig accept a paid appearance at a distant 'Fayre', only to be drug-busted at Metropolis airport and forced to take refuge in the animal-filled Flealands hotel. Younger audiences will no doubt enjoy many of the varied, often cutesy, animal turns. But what about the pathetic orangutan, Thelonius, dressed like Max in <i>Sunset Blvd.</i>? The threatening atmosphere, furthermore, recalls the circus sequence in <i>Pinocchio</i>. There's too much emphasis on sickness and cruelty, while the underlined anthropomorphism borders on freakshow excess.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The French neo-realist 'movement' began and ended with this film, whose innovations were developed neither in Clment's nor the national cinema. A semi-documentary study of World War II resistance among Breton railwaymen, using non-professional actors and natural locations, it's compromised by the director's periodic recourse to affirmative, audience-rousing set pieces, but achieves overall a sobriety that is oddly modern, even 'Bressonian' in tone.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ophls' second French film following his return from the USA was adapted from three stories by Maupassant. <i>Le Masque</i> describes how an old man wears a mask of youth at a dance hall to extend his youthful memories. <i>La Maison Tellier</i>, the longest episode, deals with a day's outing for the ladies from a brothel, and a brief romance. In <i>Le Modle</i>, the model in question jumps from a window for love of an artist, who then marries her. Although Ophls had to drop a fourth story intended to contrast pleasure and death, these three on old age, purity and marriage are shot with a supreme elegance and sympathy, and the central tale in particular luxuriates in the Normandy countryside. The whole is summed up by the concluding line, that 'happiness is no lark'.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The movie that confirmed Kurosawa's greatest strength, his innovative handling of genre. It's set amid the civil wars of 16th century Japan, and concerns samurai Mifune escorting a princess and two oafish peasants through enemy territory. Kurosawa's treatment is part traditional (the plotting, the concept, the use of Noh theatre music), part eclectic (there are reminiscences of John Ford Westerns), and part truly idiosyncratic (the Shakespearean contracts between clowns and heroes). It was clearly only a small step from this to the delights of <i>Yojimbo </i>and <i>Sanjuro</i>.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Van Sant's impressive third feature has enough ideas to fill three movies, a plenitude that threatens to blow the film apart (but never does). It's a road movie filmed mainly from the point of view of gay hustler Mike (Phoenix, superb), a narcoleptic who falls unconscious without warning at moments of stress. As Mike tours the Pacific Northwest doing 'dates', he meets up with mayor's son Scott (Reeves), and together they set off in search of Mike's mother. The disconcerting realities of the situation are punctuated by sequences of surreal, dreamlike beauty, 'documentary'-style inserts, and playful variations on Shakespeare, with Scott still playing Prince Hal to the Falstaffian Bob (Richert), a thief and ex-hustler, in the knowledge that he will soon be 'King'. Stunning to look at - the dawn and dusk landscapes are sublime - and seductively scored, the film's uniqueness lies in its remarkable emotional open-heartedness.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Shane O'Sullivan shot this first feature on DigiBeta for 20,000. Then he persuaded Barco, one of a handful of companies manufacturing digital projectors, that he could showcase their equipment if they'd lend him a projector and hire London's ABC Piccadilly for a week. Regrettably, his ingenuity didn't stretch to arranging a press preview, so we can't comment on the system, only how the film looks on VHS tape. It's like a soap opera with a fetish for fluorescent filters - a bohemian fable, set in and around Brick Lane, in the hipster manner of <i>Stranger Than Paradise</i> or <i>Mystery Train</i>. Lili (Hanayo), a free spirit in pigtails and mini skirts, has fled an arranged HK marriage to be with 'Bobby'. She bumps into Go (Shigetomo), a young Japanese detective living in a spare warehouse flat in E1. He lets her sleep on the couch and they go their separate ways, then he gets his first case - to find a runaway Chinese girl. O'Sullivan has made a thoroughly 'London' film, yet there isn't an Anglo-Saxon in the cast. It's well scored and marked by nice touches, but it's unevenly acted and too flimsy to generate anything approaching suspense.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[London,1593. Will Shakespeare (Fiennes) has lost his muse, and the prospects for his latest commission, 'Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter,' look troubled. Enter Viola Lesseps (Paltrow), who auditions for the still unwritten play and captures both the lead role and its author. John Madden's remarkably busy film - which took seven Oscars - is a far shout from the drawing-room period drama of old. It combines an interest in British regal heritage and a swift, populist, plainspoken perspective free of traditional deference. Again, too, it's at least as informed by present-day British theatre and TV as by classical literature, as a cast ranging from Dame Judi to two members of <i>The Fast Show</i> indicates. The film sports its superficiality with good humour, and the cast deserve much of the credit: Fiennes is at last truly convincing; Paltrow and Ben Affleck (as the company's star player) hold their own; and the rest of the ensemble gel seamlessly. Finally, though, it's Tom Stoppard's witty, intelligent script which proves so satisfying, effortlessly combining and recasting period comedy, creative biopic, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> adaptation, and his own brand of clever pun and play.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Is there a film clip more often shown than the title number of this most astoundingly popular musical? The rest of the movie is great too. It shouldn't be. There never was a masterpiece created from such a mishmash of elements: Arthur Freed's favourites among his own songs from back in the '20s and '30s, along with a new number, 'Make 'Em Laugh', which is a straight rip-off from Cole Porter's 'Be A Clown'; the barely blooded Debbie Reynolds pitched into the deep end with tyrannical perfectionist Kelly; choreography very nearly improvised because of pressures of time; and Kelly filming his greatest number with a heavy cold. Somehow it all comes together. The 'Broadway Melody' ballet is Kelly's least pretentious, Jean Hagen and Donald O'Connor are very funny, and the Comden/Green script is a loving-care job. If you've never seen it and don't, you're bonkers.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A film which smacks of <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> in both mood and effects, even down to a tank chase which drags Jones' well-worn heels along the desert floor. Saving us from a sense of complete dj vu is the introduction of Connery, Medievalist professor and Indiana's father. His screen image provides the perfect fatherly foil to the larger-than-life hero. Pursuing a life-long obsession with the Holy Grail brings the prof into the grip of dastardly Nazis, who of course are after the same thing. It's Indiana Jones to the rescue of his father, the Grail, nay democracy itself. Wisely dispersing with attempts to recapture the central romance of <i>Raiders</i>, the emotional core is served this time by the sparring relationship between Indiana and his dad. Jeffrey Boam's script dabbles with themes of neglect and reconciliation, but there's nothing ponderous about the duo's near death scrapes and light-hearted tussels over the same blonde Frulein.]]></review>

The bronze Titan is an arthritic disappointment, but most of the other inventions are pleasingly imaginative, not least the army of waspishly pugnacious, sword-wielding skeletons which pop out of the ground when the Hydra's teeth are sown. Great fun, as these things go, with a Bernard Herrmann score to boot.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A musical both ludicrously overpraised (especially  in Hollywood) and underrated. The script is admittedly lax, while the Gershwin numbers defer to too many  contradictory performing styles (Levant and Guetary) and can be patronisingly twee (Kelly with the children in 'I Got Rhythm'). But there are ecstatic moments, like Kelly's jazz eruption into the ballet as Toulouse-Lautrec's Chocolat, his pas-de-deux with Caron on the river-bank, his solo to 'S Wonderful'. And finally of course there is the climactic American in Paris ballet, which places dancers against backdrops pastiched from the paintings of Dufy, Renoir, Utrillo, Rousseau, Van Gogh, Manet and Toulouse-Lautrec. There are those who describe this as vulgar or pretentious, forgetting that the story is about Kelly as a frustrated artist. The sequence, besides being colourful, invigorating, ambitious, is also entirely appropriate to Minnelli's interest in his characters' emotions. To criticise this merging of form with content, of style with meaning - especially in a film-maker whose principal desire seems to have been to excite the senses - seems unwarranted.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Discretion is the better part of valour, they say. And you couldnt imagine a more discreet tribute to the heroes of the wartime French Resistance than this terrific late-60s thriller by the ex-Maquis member Melville, the director best known for his gangster masterpieces like The Samourai. Tracing the self-sacrificial exploits from October 1942 to February 1943 of a small group of field operatives  the acerbic Lino Venturas ex-engineer, Simone Signorets iron-nerved Mathilde among them  Melvilles film adopts a formal essentialism to outline the codes and manners of impassive-looking warriors over whom the Damocles sword of discovery, torture and death is ever hovering. <br />Of the themes with which the director deals so superbly  disguised emotion, organisation, trust, quiet courage, betrayal and grief  the most important is that of loyalty (and its price). The film boasts a startling visual quality, too  the suspenseful twilight escapades are shot with a beautifully muted, steely-grey colour palette by cinematographer Pierre Lhomme  and it is laced with moments of dry, sardonic wit that serve only to emphasise its devastating emotional core even more. Superb.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Depending on how you look at it, Figgis' fascinating film is the story of an alcoholic movie producer on the verge of a nervous breakdown; or it's about a two-timing lesbian starlet who gets her first big break; or it's a critical day in the life of a fledgling film production company; or it's a portrait of spurned wives, lovers and actresses on the LA scene. Four movies in one, <i>Timecode</i> splits the screen on a horizontal and a vertical axis to showcase simultaneously four unbroken shots, each 93 minutes long. The initial dizzying sensory overload doesn't last. An ingenious sound mix and the familiar faces of Skarsgrd, Hayek, Tripplehorn, Sands, Hunter and Burrows invite you to conspire order from the chaos. Characters from the top left screen bump into their neighbours from bottom right, while at two o'clock they're bitching about those assholes screwing them at eight. Like a riff on Altman's <i>Short Cuts</i> and <i>The Player</i>, it adds up to a properly jaundiced satire of Hollywood on the rocks. The movie is a stunt, a conceptual in-joke; or it's a portent of cinema to come; or it's a brilliant but hollow technical exercise; or it's a dynamic if erratic ensemble improv. Make of it what you will, it's certainly something to see.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In 1996, a virus kills five billion people. 'This already happened,' James Cole (Willis) explains to Dr Railly (Stowe) in 1990. He knows because he's been there. Six years and a matter of minutes after he vanishes from a padded cell, Cole is back in his psychiatrist's life. He must trace the contagion, but he needs Railly's help to track down former patient Goines (Pitt), whose environmental action group, the Army of the 12 Monkeys, may be behind the disaster. With its shifts in tone and style signposted by Pitt's buggy loony-toon and Willis's movingly bewildered introvert, Terry Gilliam's apocalyptic fantasy is even weirder than it sounds. Less a <i>Terminator</i>-type action pic than a spectacularly disorienting <i>inaction</i> movie, with Cole as a helpless Cassandra hooked on an image from his own past, hoping against hope that he may in fact be crazy...the film's a terrible mess, but a terribly beautiful, tender mess. The screenplay by Janet and David Peoples (<i>Blade Runner</i>, <i>Unforgiven</i>) takes off from Chris Marker's 1962 short, <i>La Jete</i>, but soon spirals into more pressing millennial obsessions (insanity, chaos and ecological catastrophe), before a vertiginous Hitchcockian make-over in the last reel. Gilliam gives the material a lunatic poetry of his own, but remains impervious to the requirements of narrative pacing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hill's remake of Kurosawa's samurai classic <i>Yojimbo</i> places the story in the Prohibition era, with Italian and Irish bootleggers clashing over Mexican liquor supplies in Jericho, Texas. 'John Smith' (Willis) takes one look at the dead horse in the middle of Main Street and gets the full measure of this godforsaken ghost town. Before long both factions are vying for his services as hired gun, and Smith cynically plays one off against the other until, steeped in blood and sickened by what he's seen, he sets about wiping out every last man. The plot will be familiar not only from <i>Yojimbo</i> but from Leone's <i>A Fistful of Dollars</i>. Hill's Tex-Mex version suggests he hasn't got the Western out of his system yet, and this highly stylised film looks like an uncomfortable exercise in cross-breeding, as if a handful of mobsters had wandered on to the wrong studio backlot. Hill goes all out for spiritual fable, with Smith bringing down the walls of Jericho, shooting for his own bloody Calvary. The conceit might have played better in a Western. As a thriller, the film tries to camouflage its lack of suspense with profligate and repetitive gunplay and a deafening barrage of noise (Ry Cooder's score is a plus, however). There's too much voice-over, and not enough for arch-nemesis Walken to do. but at least Willis has the hard-boiled hero down. An honourable failure.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Based on the true story of two Resistance heroes, Berri's typically meticulous WWII drama concerns the efforts of Lucie Aubrac to liberate her husband Raymond from Gestapo incarceration. While Bouquet and Auteuil are dependably solid, they never really achieve the chemistry that might have made this into a more moving love story; the real problem, however, lies in the leaden pacing, and Berri's superficial, somewhat repetitive screenplay, which offers no particularly revealing insights, let alone dramatic excitement. Not exactly bad, the film is rather dull, and serves mainly as a reminder of how grippingly Melville's <i>L'Arme des Ombres</i> treated similar material.]]></review>

The awful testimonies of rape and domestic violence and the defendants general lack of denial and remorse make bitterly clear that women and children are little more than disposable merchandise in this village. Yet in the scorching determination of prosecutor Vera Ngassa, as well as the stunning resilience of the adult plaintiffs who want better lives for their daughters, the film locates genuine hope for the future.]]></review>

Brad Anderson (<i>Session 9</i>) has always been strong with chilly atmosphericsespecially this time, employing the eerie vistas along the legendary line that stretches from Beijing to Moscow through thousands of miles of wilderness to great, exotic effect. Inside those cars, though, its another matter entirely.

      <review><![CDATA[Globe-hopping British documentarian Kim Longinotto is often pegged as a feminist filmmaker since the subjects of her astute and observant movies (Divorce Iranian Style, Sisters in Law) tend to be women. Yet these strong-willed and feisty females are rarely her sole focus, as theyre often lines of enquiry that let her consider questions about trends, attitudes and injustices across all of society. Rough Aunties fits that bill precisely, the title referring to the all-female membership of an aid organisation called Bobbi Bear based in Durban, South Africa. Their dismal yet vital workload includes coming to the rescue of poor children who have suffered abuse  a symptom, the director suggests, of the gaping wealth chasm.<br />Longinottos camera offers an unflinching gaze, a machine of record that she wields with a palpable sense of empathy and despair. The events she films are mostly appalling: abandoned babies with scars of repeated rape; girls suffering from sexual abuse within the home; theres even a point at which a relative of one of the team is shot and killed in front of his children. Shes interested in language too, and how gender influences communication. Sure, its a tough, unappealing topic, and Longinotto does let the philanthropic spirit of these women get the better of her in some gooey final scenes. But their resilience is infectious and this caustic document of their daily grind (and boy, is it a grind) makes for cinema that is at once reflective, poignant, unsettling and dismaying.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hollywood loves to hate itself. From Sunset Boulevard to Swimming with Sharks, films which expose the dark heart beneath the glitzy exterior  and paint their moviemaking protagonists as living, breathing, conflicted human beings  will always win favour with a Tinseltown elite desperate to see their lives reflected on screen. Somewhere inside Shrink, theres an intelligent exploration of how the unreality of the movies affects those who make and view them, as filtered through the foggy perceptions of self-medicating psychiatrist-to-the-stars Kevin Spacey and the various filmmakers, fuck-ups and family members he associates with (including Saffron Burrows, Robert Loggia and a wisely uncredited Robin Williams). But any fleeting moments of wit or insight  and there are a few  are drowned out by the monumental self-importance and grinding, humourless predictability of the picture. It doesnt help that the characters are petty and unlikeable, the score tediously heavy-handed and the supposedly uplifting climactic scenes laughably saccharine and unconvincing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Just as director Rachid Boucharebs Algerian ancestry inspired him to tell in his 2007 film Days of Glory of the Maghrebian contribution to the effort to recover France from the Nazis in 1944, so, presumably, French filmmaker Robert Gudiguians own background inspired this latest, equally revisionist wartime drama which offers a thrilling and informative new angle on the war in France.<br />Gudiguian is best known for modern-day, Marseilles-set films such as Marius and Jeanette and My Father is an Engineer, but he is half Armenian and was latterly involved with the French communists, and this second of his historical films, after 2005s The Last Mitterrand, turns out to be just as personal as his more local ones, despite the grand period canvas on which it unfolds.<br />It focuses on the guerilla efforts of the Manouchian group  a unit of Paris-based communists and immigrants who helped the armed struggle against Nazi occupation. Heading this unit with some initial reluctance was the Armenian poet Missak Manouchian (Simon Abkarian) who directed a band of Jews, Hungarians, Poles and others to sabotage Nazi rule. What this film describes is the radicalisation of Manouchian and his comrades and the execution of their mission  a fatal mission, as we know from the 22 names heard over the opening credits to the refrain of Mort pour la France.<br />The title is a double nod  firstly, to the nickname given to Manouchian and his colleagues after they were executed in 1944 and, secondly, to Jean-Pierre Melvilles 1969 masterpiece Army of Shadows, a film which dramatised with cold brilliance the rituals of the French resistance. But while Melville suggested that all of France was resisting or supportive of the resistance, Gudiguian adopts a more nuanced stance. By dramatising the efforts of the Francs-Tireurs, the leftist resistance, he dispels the myth of a unified, Gaullist resistance  an assumption that was first and most powerfully exploded in cinema by Marcel Ophls in his 1969 doc The Sorrow and the Pity.<br />Dramatically, though, Gudiguian doesnt live up to Melville, who condensed the spirit of the resistance to a tense drama of few personalities. Gudiguian, meanwhile, calls on a rambling ensemble to serve the many points he has to make about wartime France and why people did  and did not  join the resistance, from stressing Manouchians memories of war in Armenia and the motivations of French Jew Marcel (Robinson Stvenin) after his father is deported, to the idealistic communism of young Hungarian Thomas (Gregoire Leprince-Ringuet) and the self-serving collaboration with the French police of young Jew, Monique (Lola Naymark). <br />The breadth of Gudiguians story is sometimes at the expense of dramatic momentum, but nobody could accuse him of over-simplification. His film is always fascinating and is a crucial, stirring addition to the cinema about wartime France.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Drugs. Cops. Gang warfare. It could be New York, London, or even Baltimore (as devotees of The Wire know only too well). However Ajami is a neighbourhood in Jaffa, a bustling and ancient Israeli port officially conjoined with Tel-Aviv. Given that its one of the places where Jews and Arabs live side by side, it also presents a microcosm of the divisions affecting the region. And, needless to say, that scenario makes the law enforcement situation a lot more complicated, since the largely Jewish police force are seen as occupiers by the Arab population theyre supposed to be protecting.<br />That arresting combination of the familiar and unfamiliar is a constant in this ensemble drama from the cross-cultural writing and directing team of Jewish Yaron Shani and Israeli-resident Palestinian Scandar Copti. The story, for instance, hits whats become almost a movie default mode, tracking sundry criss-crossing fortunes in a compact cityscape, yet on this occasion its the perfect form to map out the tensions bringing very different individuals to collision point.<br />At one extreme, theres the Palestinian son desperate to buy his way out of a bloody family feud with another Arab clan, and turning to risky drug-dealing as a result. At the other, theres an Israeli cop facing a daily round of friction and resentment at work, and whose life has been on hold ever since his soldier sibling went missing  possibly murdered by a Palestinian terror group. Between these two poles, meet a partying Palestinian sous-chef whose Jewish girlfriend causes tension with his Arab mate, and a restaurant owner whos a Christian Arab but takes a precarious, paternalistic interest in the lives of his Arab workers (some legal, some not).<br /><br />Everything begins and ends in gunfire, but between times theres a steady build-up in anxiety and understanding, since its only by realising the limited options available in these characters circumstances that we can put ourselves in their position and begin to feel for them. <br />Unlike, say, Waltz with Bashir and Lebanon, theres no sense of redemptive Jewish liberal guilt, nor a micron of false optimism. Its one big political and personal cluster-fuck, but its only through comprehending the component parts of this dire scenario that anyone can move forward. Authenticitys not in doubt, since the actors are non-professionals playing roles close to their own lives, and what we see is multi-camera first-take spontaneity sprung from months of workshops rather than a screenplay.<br />Perhaps the occasionally elaborate structure feels like its over-gilding the lily when the basic power of the events is plain enough. Otherwise, though, this is vividly challenging, utterly inclusive and heartfelt cinema. Its not only gripping to watch, but itll open your eyes to the intractable human conundrums behind the blood-stained headlines.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Set in the plague year of 1348, Christopher Smiths best film to date is a tale of fundamentalist Christianity, fearful superstition and atavistic paganism. Based on a fluid, intelligent screenplay by Dario Poloni, it marks Smith out as Britains most talented, least appreciated genre filmmaker. Striking visuals, confident storytelling, authentically grubby settings and an unsettling moral relativism combine to make his fourth feature emotionally involving, action-packed and thought-provoking.<br /><br />After persuading his secret lover, Averill (Kimberley Nixon), to flee their plague-ravaged town, doubting novice monk Osmund (Eddie Redmayne) joins the bishops devout military envoy, Ulric (Sean Bean), and his ragtag band of mercenaries on an expedition to a remote village. This village has mysteriously been spared the pestilence and is rumoured to be a hotbed of pagan beliefs and necromancy. Dragging behind them a huge wooden torture device, Ulric and his men are guided by Osmund through the woods and marshes, encountering bandits and witch-burning locals en route. The village, however, appears to be a benign gynocracy presided over by healer Langiva (Carice van Houten) and her avuncular acolyte, Hob (Tim McInnerny).<br /> Beneath this placid surface, however, is a roiling pit of religious duplicity and moral decay. <br />Horror fans will note a structural similarity to The Wicker Man, but the real creative touchstone here is Herzogs Aguirre, Wrath of God. The ruthless Ulric represents the official church, yet his zealotry prompts the Abbot (David Warner) to remark: That man is more dangerous than the pestilence itself. For all her showy paganism, is Langiva a heretical necromancer or merely a charlatan witch? Her bizarre birds-nest hairdo (and van Houtens wavering accent) does not inspire confidence, yet the lovestruck Osmund is tempted to abandon his faith. This is bracing, often brutal stuff, set in a world where, as Ulric says, God has slipped over the horizon.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This promising but frustrating debut feature from Spanish commercials director Gabe Ibez opens with a jarring, disorientating car crash before easing into a more ambient psychological thriller that is, in effect, a sub-Polanski study of a woman torn apart by grief. While on a ferry to the island of Hierro, Maria (Elena Anaya) falls asleep; when she wakes up, her five-year-old son, Diego (Kaiet Rodrguez), is missing. Six months later, Maria returns to the island to identify the body of a young boy, but its not Diego. Convinced her son was kidnapped, Maria slides into a somnolent state, slipping between sanity-testing lucidity and an obsessive, hallucinatory madness. <br />The multi-layered script by Javier Gulln (El Rey de la Montaa) powerfully evokes Marias fractured state of mind, but both the insistent score by Zacaras M de la Riva and Ibezs highly stylised direction are overwrought. The films uneven tone, alternating between dream-like atmospherics and melodramatic suspense, distracts us from Anayas intense, moving performance with fidgety details, arbitrary close-ups of insects and a CG flock of birds that creates a flap about nothing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Fifty years on, you could say that Hitchcocks sleek, wry, paranoid thriller caught the zeitgeist perfectly: Cold War shadiness, secret agents of power, urbane modernism, the ant-like bustle of city life, and a hint of dread behind the sharp suits of affluence. Cary Grants Roger Thornhill, the films sharply dressed ad exec who is sucked into a vortex of mistaken identity, certainly wouldnt be out of place in Mad Men. But theres nothing dated about this perfect storm of talent, from Hitchcock and Grant to writer Ernest Lehman (Sweet Smell of Success), co-stars James Mason and Eva Marie Saint, composer Bernard Herrmann and even designer Saul Bass, whose opening-credits sequence still manages to send a shiver down the spine.<br />Hitchcock breezes through a tongue-in-cheek, nightmarish plot with a lightness of touch thats equalled by a charming performance from Grant (below), who copes effortlessly with the scripts dash between claustrophobia and intrigue on one hand and romance and comedy on the other. The story is a pass-the-parcel of escalating threats, all of them interior fears turned inside-out: doubting mothers, untrustworthy lovers, vague government handlers, corrupt cops. Within minutes of the films opening, shady strangers in a hotel lobby mistake Thornhill for a George Caplin and from there we sprint from country house to the United Nations, from the ticket hall of Grand Central Station to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. Thornhills ignorance of his fate and complete lack of control offer Hitchcock a brilliant blank canvas on which to experiment with a story that would sound ludicrous on paper, yet it feels like anythings possible in Lehmans playful script. Im an advertising man, not a red herring, says Thornhill. He couldnt be more mistaken.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A British comedy that's classy and commercial - and, most important, very, very funny. Admittedly, as it charts the social, sexual and romantic fortunes of thirty-something Charles (Grant), a self-confessed serial monogamist, and the friends, old flames and potential lovers (notably MacDowell's rather enigmatic American beauty), who are his fellow guests at one wedding after another, the film's focus on well-heeled jovial oafs and its conventional attitude to modern relationships hardly make for 'radical romantic comedy'. But that's quibbling. Newell's direction switches smoothly between affecting intimacy and sequences of rowdy chaos; perhaps the film's trump card, however, is its emotional honesty, particularly in the poignant and sobering funeral scene. Genuine feel-good entertainment.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
One of the finest mainstream <i>noir</i>-thrillers ever made. As Bogart's Marlowe gets involved with the Sternwood family's many problems (drugs, blackmail, nymphomania and murder), Hawks never allows the plot to get in the way of his real interest: the growing love, based on remarkably explicit sexual attraction, between Bogie and Bacall, and the way that emotion causes both of them to modify their initial positions regarding the criminal goings-on. In fact, the story is virtually incomprehensible at points, but who cares when the sultry mood, the incredibly witty and memorable script, and the performances are so impeccable?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Just as assured as <i>The Apple</i>, and considerably more ambitious, 20-year-old Makhmalbaf's second feature - co-written and edited by her father Mohsen - is an enigmatic, metaphorical fable set in Iranian Kurdistan, hard by the Iraqi border. Two teachers break away from their nomadic group in search of pupils; one joins up with kids smuggling contraband across the mountains, the other with a bunch of elderly exiles trying to return to their homeland. Neither group is interested in education, especially as they're too busy watching out for unseen border patrols. There are astonishing images here, and some extraordinarily tense, suggestive set-pieces, particularly in the bleak final half-hour; but the occasionally repetitive narrative, the often oblique script, and the overall austerity make it less immediately accessible than its predecessor. Memorably poetic film-making, all the same.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Now here's a plot to make a Marxist-Leninist weep: posh girl meets posh bloke, then realises his posh pal is nicer. The end. And yet this ultra-hyped adaptation of the ultra-successful Helen Fielding novel sends you out with a smile on your face. For a simple reason: where <i>Four Weddings </i>and <i>Notting Hill</i> ask you to feel sympathy for a privileged git who radiates self-love, Bridget Jones (Zellweger) really does seem a hopeless case. Why? Because she's overweight and stays that way - for all Bridget's New Year resolutions, there's no 'ugly duckling blossoms into swan' scenario here. She's also witty, and has a quivery way with her chunky nose and mouth that makes watching her feel refreshingly non-voyeuristic. Like a prodigious toddler, Bridget wears a permanent expression of concentration and it rubs off on us. That Grant is for once supposed to be shallow is another plus. As for Firth, how he manages to make Mr Darcy (aka Mr Right) non-ludicrous is a mystery. In a romantic comedy that runs suspiciously like clockwork, Darcy's embarrassment, like Bridget's body, feels blissfully warm to the touch.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[David Leans black-and-white masterpiece may be a whirlwind tour of Dickens novel, but what a well-performed, economic and atmospheric tour it is, and one that manages in two hours to capture much of the chronological and emotional sweep of a 525-page novel. Leans superb opening recreation of the ominous Kent marshes, with young Pip (Anthony Wager) hurrying past a series of gallows-posts, sets the scene for this young childs brush with fate and accidental elevation to a young London gentleman (played then by John Mills, already too old at 38). The characters have the same immediate power as on the page: Bernard Miles is gentle, damaged and good as Joe Gargery; Finlay Currie is terrifying and vulnerable as Magwitch; Martita Hunts imperial Miss Havisham has nasty charm; and Jean Simmons young Estella is dangerously alluring. A 32-year-old Alec Guinness (from whose stage-production the film emerged) is excellent as Pips oh-so-decent companion, Herbert Pocket. And Pips awkward scenes with Joe Gargery relate as powerfully now to themes of class, home, aspiration and snobbery as in 1946 and the mid nineteenth century. See it!]]></review>

A group of picnickers wandering in a summery wood change into evening-dress, emerge into the grounds of a stately mansion, and are rescued from a band of roving thugs by their host, who ushers them to a magnificent banquet laid out under the stars. Then a man is reported to have left the party; the urbanity vanishes; tracker dogs can be heard howling in the distance. The allegory is obvious, of course, with the avuncular dictator mouthing platitudes, his brutish minions straining at the leash, and the guests submitting like patient sheep to the pointless show of the party. But once one has grasped the message and admired the glittering camerawork, that's about it (although the dialogue may well have carried more hidden charges for Czech audiences).]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Three apparently ill-matched souls find a measure of understanding in this telegraphed drama. Charleen (Tremarco) is on the run from her home in the Midlands, where her dad has been abusing her handicapped sister; Declan (Sinclair Blyth) has left a conventional upbringing behind to find himself on the road as an eco-warrior. After a fracas with the police at his latest protest site, Declan and Charleen take refuge in a camper van by the roadside, and find themselves in the company of Vera (Hancock), who's on her way to the Ring of Brodgar in Orkney for a sentimental reunion of sorts before advancing illness gets the better of her. So the scene is set for a study in cross-generational misunderstanding and coming together. Young folk learn a little about life, old girl gets to realise they're not such a bad lot, and so forth. Thankfully, Hancock's performance is a wonder of restraint, which more or less keeps the film going while we wonder why the sexual abuse subplot feels so superficial, why Declan is relatively undeveloped, and what the film-makers thought they would gain by delivering exactly what we expect from beginning to end.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Once you've seen Ludwig Bemelmans' idiosyncratic drawing of the twelve little girls in two straight lines dissolve into little actors, you've seen it all. We're at a school for young ladies in Paris in the '50s. Hatty Jones as the fearless heroine is likeable, while McDormand is, as ever, absolutely in her role. Her Miss Clavel presents physical comedy instead of the rather neurotic tilt of the original; her panics are very watchable as she tries to keep tabs on her brood. Hawthorne could have phoned in his Lord Covington, who decides to sell the school, so little does he have to do. The various ambassadors who arrive as potential buyers are put off by pranks, none memorable. Another plot, presumably born of desperation, involves the kidnapping of the Spanish ambassador's son, who registers a faintly leering presence astride a motor scooter.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[While widely regarded as an example of Mackendrick's decline after the masterpiece that was <i>Sweet Smell of Success</i>, this is certainly not the mere 'family fodder' that disappointed Leslie Halliwell. Indeed, like <i>A High Wind in Jamaica</i> and <i>Mandy</i>, it is another of the director's dark, somewhat sour studies in child psychology: as the young McClelland, suddenly orphaned during an air-raid on Port Said, makes his long and lonely journey down through Africa in search of his aunt in Durban, he encounters all kinds of danger and criminality with barely a blink of an eye. If the pace is oddly flaccid in places and the photography sometimes verges on travelogue territory, there is no denying the vitality of the performances, Robinson being particularly affecting as the diamond mining outlaw who takes Sammy temporarily under his wing. Indeed, as in <i>High Wind</i>, it is the adults, rather than Sammy, who finally suffer the most, and the film stands alongside <i>The Man in the White Suit</i>, <i>Whisky Galore!</i> and <i>The Ladykillers</i> as a sceptical overturning of conventional ideas about innocence and experience.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA['We have to change our way of living.' So says Ingrid Bergman in the Rossellini film Pierre (Auteuil) and Anne (Huppert) go to see shortly before she feels moved to tell him she's fallen in love with another man. And Ingrid's right: Pierre and Anne may have been comfortable together for years - they're well-off, they have a smart apartment, a two-year-old son, supportive friends - but while Anne's admission seems at first barely to impinge on Pierre's consciousness, pretty soon he's suffering wild swings of emotion. Could they stay together? Will she leave? Should he throw her out? Whatever, the entire edifice of the relationship they've built up over the years looks set to crumble. Plotwise, that's about it in this study of a disintegrating partnership, but no matter: the film (a subtle, intelligent adaptation of Dan Franck's perceptive but rather indulgent novel) is about the minute shifts in power that occur as Anne tries to make up her mind about her future and Pierre attempts to keep up with or even forestall her changing behaviour. Happily, Vincent is beautifully served by the performers, with Huppert and Auteuil equally superb as the couple striving, against all odds, to emerge intact from a nightmare scenario.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Often looking rather like a filmed acting workshop, von Trier's first movie made according to the back-to-basics 'Dogma 95' manifesto centres on the emotional and social dynamics of a group of people who, for various reasons, go around pretending to be mentally and/or physically handicapped. What little plot there is charts the tensions that lead some of them to consider leaving the cult, but the film's real interest lies in its exploration of different kinds of 'performance', and in its often very funny satirical look at the way 'normal' society treats 'abnormal' people. Emotionally and intellectually, the movie never quite delivers on its promise, and the frequent views of the boom, the shadow of the camera crew and so forth are irritating distractions (manifesto or not, this is <i>not</i> 'pure' cinema), but it is consistently intriguing, involving, and finally quite unlike anything else.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Godard's first feature, adapted from an existing scenario written by Franois Truffaut, spins a pastiche with pathos as joyrider Belmondo shoots a cop, chases friends and debts across a night-time Paris, and falls in love with a literary lady. Seberg quotes books and ideas and names; Belmondo measures his profile against Bogart's, pawns a stolen car, and talks his girlfriend into a cash loan 'just till midday'. The camera lavishes black-and-white love on Paris, strolling up the Champs-Elyses, edging across caf terraces, sweeping over the rooftop skyline, Mozart mixing with cool jazz riffs in the night air. The ultimate night-time <i>film noir noir noir</i>... until Belmondo pulls his own eyelids shut when he dies. More than any other, this was the film which epitomised the iconoclasm of the early <i>Nouvelle Vague</i>, not least in its insolent use of the jump-cut.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Jay Ward's 1960s animated TV series is fondly remembered for its pun-filled humour. This, however, is a misguided animation/live-action crossbreed. Escaping cartoonland for the real world, Fearless Leader (De Niro) and accomplice Natasha Fatale (Russo) launch a secretly located TV station to bombard the populace with programmes of such hypnotic inanity that everyone feels compelled to vote Fearless president. Via some fantastic plot mechanism (and some average computer generated images), their arch rivals - squirrel Rocky and dim-witted moose pal Bullwinkle - are enlisted to help FBI agent Karen Sympathy (Perabo) track them down. Yes, we know the film's poking fun at Hollywood and TV, but the gags are mostly insipid, and when they do hit the mark, they're pitched too high for youngsters.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The most populous sprawl on earth proves a vivid barometer for the state of 21st-century civilisation in this feverish Mexico City triptych. Gonzlez Irritu's Rottweiler of a movie slams street-level toughs up against glamorous, high society celebrity, then picks over the carnage. In the first story, lovelorn Octavio (Garca) turns to dogfighting to scrape enough money together to steal away his brother's wife. In the second, a magazine editor leaves his family for beautiful model Valeria (Toledo), just as an accident lands her in a wheelchair. The aftermath - involving an urban legend about a dog trapped under the floorboards - turns their lives inside out. The final story centres on an ex-Communist revolutionary (Echevarra) who prefers the companionship of mutts to people. Steeped in disgust, he accepts a contract to murder a businessman, but even as he confronts the worst, he somehow summons a shred of dignity and hope. Recalling <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> and <i>Pulp Fiction</i> - but edgier than both - this is a hell of a first film. For all its bonecrunching savagery, it's also a fundamentally moral work. The love of animals is one redeeming grace note, even as Gonzlez Irritu makes it clear that the love of mankind is a far greater challenge.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Although made in the Lake District with a mainly dubbed cast, Arthur Kennedy as a very American English policeman, and a plot indebted to <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>, this works against all the odds. Through intelligent handling of locations, England becomes a very bleak place indeed, full of sinister quietness. Hero and heroine, thrown together by chance, find themselves pursued by both police and an army of cannibalistic living dead through this increasingly nightmarish landscape. It's a film of unrelieved blackness, from the seedy photographer who snaps his junkie wife cowering in the bath to homicidal babies, from mongol child at a petrol station to Kennedy's brutal sergeant. It's all the more absurdly fatalistic for refusing to draw political, moral or social conclusions.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Despite the cringingly unfunny jive-talk opener, Sonys first computer-animation turns out to be a bit of a hoot, replete with some fabulous characterisations and a couple of decent songs. Boog the domesticated grizzly (voice of Martin Lawrence) leads such a cosseted lifestyle that he wouldnt even entertain the idea of living in the wild. Until he meets stressed-out elk-type creature Elliot (Ashton Kutcher), who persuades the big fella to accompany him back into the woods. Boog lives to regret the decision, however, when a) He cant find a decent spot to defecate and b) Billy Connollys band of squirrels start pummelling him with nuts. Will the approaching open season galvanise the bear into helping the forest creatures fight off the annual gathering of huntsmen or will he forego their plight and mosey on back to his cosy suburban existence? Conventional animals vs humans storyline notwithstanding, I have to say that the humour here (some of it Pythonesque) is mostly spot on and, at times, mischievously dark. Just be prepared to swallow the implausibility of various species all getting along in perfect harmony. This is Hollywood after all.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Theres something of Joe Orton about The History Boys, the play by Alan Bennett which makes the transfer from stage to screen with its original director, National Theatres Nicholas Hytner, in tow, and both cast and script intact, give or take the odd character, new scene and cinematic flourish here and there. In plays like What the Butler Saw and Loot, Orton embraced the palatable trappings of farce  swinging doors and dropping trousers  to mask an otherwise strong vein of anti-establishment and, for its time, daring thought. Bennett, who penned Prick Up Your Ears about Orton in 1987, plays a similar, if not quite so crafty, game with The History Boys, which offers a sly mix of broad comedy, tender wordplay and heartfelt subversion. Its a two-headed film which one could easily enjoy solely as a protest for more imagination in the classroom, while ignoring completely its radical and central plea for sexual and emotional liberation. Such is Bennetts particular knack: to present spiky gifts in pleasant-looking packages.<br />Its 1983 at a grammar school in Sheffield, but really it could be anywhere in England at any time in the past few decades, despite the splattering of Smiths and New Order on the soundtrack, as eight boys prepare to take the entrance exam that could propel them to Oxford and Cambridge to study history. They certainly dont behave like most sixth-formers. Posner (Samuel Barnett), a spotty and vulnerable boy, openly touts his affection for Dakin (Dominic Cooper), the confident class hunk, who, despite his fumblings with the headmasters assistant (Georgia Taylor), has a bit of thing  perhaps reciprocated  for their young teaching temp, Irwin (Stephen Campbell Moore). Lording over them is their passionate and dedicated general studies teacher, Hector (Richard Griffiths), who sneers at the very thought of the kind of thrusting exam-training that Irwin propounds and runs unorthodox classes during which the boys act out brothel-scenes in French or re-enact moments from Now, Voyager and Brief Encounter (both films which Bennett, in his memoirs, recalls from childhood, a distinct sign of how personal this film is to him). <br />Hectors passion comes at a price: each evening, he likes to give a different boy a lift home on his motorbike and then cop a feel mid-journey, much to the amusement of his eyeball-rolling students. Most of them oblige, but, crucially, they also tell him where to shove it at the moment when hand meets thigh. The boys are in control. They play Hectors game in return for his unique teaching. Theyre aware, too, that he is weak (a secret sorrow, Bennett calls it) and needs support; in one very moving scene, he breaks down in tears before them. <br />Its an actors film. Griffiths gives a heartbreaking performance of charisma and weakness reminiscent of his Monty in Withnail and I. The boys make a fine ensemble, and Moore balances cockiness and unease. The plays rock is Frances de la Tours Mrs Lintott, neither eccentric like Hector nor careerist like Irwin. (A grope is a grope, she declares. It is not the annunciation.) Shes a straightforward teacher, old-fashioned, dedicated, sensible, dull even. Shes unwavering, whereas the men around her are as solid as sandcastles; more dynamic maybe, but ready to crumble at any second. Even the army-like, little British headmaster (Clive Merrison, with a performance straight out of Dads Army) is a grades-grabbing fraud, all straight-back and no substance: I was a geographer. I went to Hull, he says, barely concealing his own shame with a mask of bravado.<br />Bennett has written elsewhere that he looks back on his own schooldays and remembers nothing of the exuberance of The History Boys. No larger-than-life teachers. No schoolboy love affairs. He remembers his own sexuality as hovering somewhere between the latent and non-existent. Yet he admits the play  and so the film  is rooted in his own experience. The behaviour he applies to the pupils must be seen partly as wish-fulfilment  a heightened, superbly and comically written drama within the real and recognisable confines of a drab school. Most audiences will find it (maybe surprisingly given the Brit-com marketing campaign) to be a very gay film, and we should view the boys comfort at same-sex attraction and lack of homophobia as hopeful thinking on Bennetts part, a dramatic rejection of repression and longing, and a celebration of emotional honesty as central to intellectual blossoming. (In one scene, Irwin and Dakin literally hide in the closet from their prosaic, straight-as-a-die headmaster.)<br />The transfer from stage to film isnt entirely trouble-free. Theres a conflict, if only slight, between the films more intimate scenes, such as the tender exchange between Hector and Posner as they discuss war poetry, which are shot in close-up, and those ensemble scenes which retain theatrical blocking and sit oddly with the realism of the films location work. A few musical montages jar too, not least one which resembles an A-ha music video reshot on an Oxford quad. Its not the most cinematic of adaptations, but that barely matters when the performances and the writing  with quotable lines aplenty  are both so smart.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Thomas McCarthys belated follow up to his low-key 2003 indie gem The Station Agent takes as its inspiration the lives of illegal immigrants in America, creating a stark, pointedly political character drama.<br />The initial setup reminds us of McCarthys earlier film: another lonely misanthrope  in this case Richard Jenkinss disheartened economics professor Walter Vale  is forced into contact with other human beings, and finds himself opening up in the process. Here the intruders are immigrant couple Tarek and Zainab, who have been illegally squatting in Walters New York apartment, and with whom he begins a tentative, wary friendship. But when Tarek is arrested by Homeland Security officers and banged up in a grim, urban repatriation facility, Walter is forced to make a choice: abandon Tarek to his fate, or step up and get involved. The arrival on the scene of Tareks beautiful, widowed mother only adds another layer of emotional complexity to Walters already tangled situation.<br />The character work in The Visitor is admittedly lovely: there are moments of conflict, tenderness and intimate self-discovery that hint at real depths in the figures on screen. But McCarthys political story is far less convincing. Implausibly warm and logically fuzzy, his treatment of his immigrant protagonists smacks of crude political correctness. These figures are essentially perfect: polite, fun-loving and affectionate, model citizens pitted against a faceless, repressive state. While elements of this may ring true, it feels distinctly underwhelming as drama, drowning McCarthys subtle, searching dialogue and incisive, humanist character development in a morass of right thinking, left-leaning platitudes. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[After the Spy Kids trilogy, more family frolics from Robert Rodriguez as writer, director, producer and editor. This time, a rainbow-hued wishing stone appears the answer to bullied schoolboy Tobys problems, but, as ever, its a case of being careful what you wish for. Before long, junior has to contend with rampaging crocodiles, a giant nasal bogey, thimble-sized aliens, his pal sprouting telephone ears and so forth. <br />The chaos comes so thick and fast that Rodriguez slices the action into a series of shorts as Toby (Jimmy Bennett) tries to get his head round events. Like so much else, this might have seemed a good idea at the time, but it holds up the flow, and makes a half-baked story even scrappier. You cant fault the films exuberance, but its draggy in spots, with the grown-up cast (rotund James Spaders sinister gadget magnate, William H Macys nervy bio-scientist) outshone by Jolie Vaniers little terror  nattily monikered Helvetica Black.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This doc from Taking Liberties director Chris Atkins received ample coverage recently when it was revealed that the filmmaker had placed false stories about celebrities in the tabloids. The films subject is fame: our desire for it and our medias willingness to feed that desire, even if that means repeating lies or executing sloppy journalism, a particular danger in an age of dwindling resources. That last point was covered more deeply in the book Flat Earth News by Nick Davies, who appears in the film to give it some weight, but Atkins is keener to bring comedy to the subject with a series of stunts that make for amusing if hardly revelatory watching. We have to endure a fictional narrator for a framing device that doesnt entirely work, but its a fun ride through a dark place.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Imagine if you salvaged a grubby VHS tape off the roadside only to discover it contained outtakes from an amateur Jackass knock-off. Thats what the new movie from scurrilous trash-art guru Harmony Korine feels like. Its an interminable montage of bin-based horseplay, appliance smashing, high-pitched yowling and affected bad taste thats fully aware of its own wilful derangement. Plus, its all carried out by four actors (including Korine and his wife, Rachel) wearing prosthetic OAP masks and gaudy dimestore threads. With its free-associative style and scuzzy VHS aesthetic, the film suggests Korine is trying to recapture the scintillating Southern-gothic poetry of Gummo, his sublime 1998 debut, while casting off the glossy production-value shackles of his lacklustre 2007 film Mister Lonely  but he only succeeds in bastardising the style of the former while achieving the low quality of the latter. Of course, there will be a core nucleus of hardened Korinites who will happily cheer along with every pelvic thrust, but for everyone else, this is a puerile and bafflingly hollow work.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Described as the biggest unsustainable development on the planet, Canadas vast Tar Sands region offers rich pickings for anyone greedy enough to get their hands dirty at the expense of the environment. According to this latest doc on the horrific side-effects of oil production, it takes four barrels of water from the Athabasca River to produce one barrel of crude. Ninety per cent of this processed, toxic water is then pumped into vast lakes, some of which leaks into the nearby river. Small wonder the community of Fort Chipewyan, where cancer rates are strangely high, is up in arms. <br />Despite covering similar ground as Dirty Oil, this third instalment in the Co-ops Tar Sands trilogy proves more illustrative and less scholarly. But, tragically, you sense campaigners are banging their heads against a wall: a few faint bells of disquiet are no match for the cacophony of a trillion cash-tills. Perhaps the Gulf of Mexico disaster will do more for the cause than a film ever could?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Jonathan Lynn is the director of such high-concept/low-quality comedies as Nuns on the Run and Clue (aka the Cluedo movie), and anyone who has seen those will know what to expect from Wild Target, an extremely ropey remake of Pierre Salvadoris jocular, 1993 French hit Cible Emouvante. Bill Nighy plays hermetic, near silent and sexually confused assassin Victor Maynard who  via a series of unlikely events  must turn protector to brassy kleptomaniac Emily Blunt and pot-bonging naif Rupert Grint. The actors do the best with what theyre given  its just a shame theyve been given so little. The script is free of either zingers or insight, the inertia of the story is constantly stalled by deviation (including a superfluous homoerotic vignette which appears to be a cheap excuse to show Grint in the nud) and entire characters  including the baddie of the piece, Rupert Everett  are left to fade into the background. Nothing feels like its been properly thought through, highlighted by the fact that Nighys super assassin goes about his business by merely opening fire on a crowded market place (using a silencer, of course!).]]></review>

Although the two films are similar  both are built on marital strife, knockabout violence and shouting  Bounty Hunter at least had the comic charisma of Jennifer Aniston to paper over the cracks. With Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher in the leads, charm is not an option.<br />Its a shame, because theres a half-decent premise to Killers. Kutcher plays Spencer, a CIA hitman who turns in his gun when he falls for Heigls meek daddys girl. So it comes as a surprise to her when, three years into their marriage, it turns out all their suburban neighbours are also hired killers, paid to keep Spencer in line. Director Robert Luketics grasp of action is almost as ham-fisted as his understanding of character, and Kutcher and Heigl are unable to bring any warmth to what is at heart a bitter, cynical script. Just awful.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Though now completed with 20 minutes Forman had to trim from the original 1984 release, this cut is substantially the same movie. So how does the multiple Oscar-winning adaptation of Peter Shaffer's play stand up? In some respects, this ideas-driven drama, unfolding at a leisurely pace and guided by the thrust and counter-thrust of literate dialogue, is a relic from a more enlightened age. A lavish costume piece where classical music is the star and the subject is God-given genius as a catalyst for joy, jealousy and misunderstanding. Sheer craftsmanship is the film's key strength. The framing device in which institutionalised former Viennese court composer Salieri (Abraham) confesses to the 'murder' of Mozart (Hulce) elegantly shapes a potted biography of the prodigiously gifted Wolfgang Amadeus, all the while deftly inscribing the torment of a man whose musicianly estimation of the scandalously under-appreciated Mozart made his own success resoundingly empty. With its painterly camerawork, Prague locations and glorious soundtrack, the overall effect is hugely impressive, yet the film somehow fails to excite any rush of emotion.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Tackling Harper Lee's novel, Stanley Kramer would have hit us over the head with a hammer, so perhaps we can be grateful that Mulligan merely suffocates with righteousness. The film sits somewhere between the bogus virtue of Kramer's <i>The Defiant Ones</i> and the poetry of Laughton's <i>Night of the Hunter</i>, combining racial intolerance with the nightmares of childhood, born out of Kennedy's stand on civil rights and Martin Luther King's marching. In Alabama in the early '30s, Peck is a Lincoln-like lawyer who defends a black (Peters) against a charge of rape, while loony-tune Duvall scares the shit out of Peck's kids. It looks like a storybook of the Old South, with dappled sunlight and woodwormy porches, and Peck is everyone's favourite uncle. But screenwriter Horton Foote does less well by Harper Lee's novel than Lillian Hellman did by Foote's <i>The Chase </i>for Arthur Penn. That movie really was a pressure-cooker; this one is always just off the boil.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In the pleasingly rambling garden of a country house north of Paris, lecturer Frdric (Charles Berling), New York-based designer Adrienne (Juliette Binoche) and Jrmie (Jrmie Renier), who toils profitably for a French sportswear company in Beijing, are gathered with partners and kids for a lunch to celebrate the seventy-fifth birthday of their widowed mother Hlne (Edith Scob). Shes the proudly independent and protective keeper of the flame  and the valuable collected belongings  of her late uncle, a well-known artist, so when, months later, Hlne herself dies, the three siblings come together once more to decide what to do with the house, its coveted contents, and Hlnes faithful housekeeper Eloise<br />Assayass most fully satisfying film for some while, this is a warm, wise drama about the tensions and mysteries of family life. With a seemingly loose but meticulously assembled narrative in the style of his earlier ensemble piece Late August, Early September, it chronicles the interactions between the various characters with psychological subtlety and precision, even as it explores the changing roles played by art, property, work and blood-ties in an increasingly globalised world. <br />While never ignoring the grief death causes, Assayas refuses to sentimentalise; <br />its a film of deft, delicate nuances, particularly alert to the fact that everyone has not only his/her reasons but also, inevitably, secrets that will be borne to the grave. Perhaps the characters are finally a little too uniformly decent, but it would be churlish to bemoan the generosity of spirit in a film so beautifully performed, intelligently written and fluently directed. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Like Ricky Gervais before him, Russell Brand is in his Hollywood honeymoon period: the man can just turn up, be himself and the camera will love him. The question of what happens if  like Ricky  it turns out he can only play one increasingly tiresome role is irrelevant: for now, we can all just rejoice in the fact that one of Londons most divisive, idiosyncratic oddballs has scaled the heights of Tinseltown superstardom  reserving, of course, the right to point and jeer at him on the way back down.<br />A British audiences enjoyment of Get Him to the Greek will depend entirely on their Brand tolerance: those already sick of his incessant self-love and florid Victorian dandyisms should steer clear. Although Jonah Hill as the long-suffering record exec tasked with delivering Russells rock legend to the titular LA theatre may be the putative frontman, this is Brands movie all the way: hes the one snorting the drugs, throwing the tantrums and getting the lions share of the laughs.<br />And the laughs are big: coupling the preening Britrock clichs of Spinal Tap with the edgy darkness of yuppie nightmare movies like Scorseses After Hours, the film has a manic, propulsive intensity that culminates in a series of excessive and hilarious comic setpieces. That it also has a big soft heart will come as no surprise to followers of the modern American man-com, though Get Him to the Greek delivers a surprisingly raw, thoughtful and gender-sensitive take on the obligatory aw-shucks ending. For now, Russells rep seems secure.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Digitally restored by the BFI to mark the fiftieth anniversary of Hammer Horror, this creepy period yarn has retained much of its bite. A tripartite narrative focuses on the death of amateur vampire hunter Jonathan Harker (John Van Eyssen) and the subsequent ripples of terror that engulf the family of his girlfriend and one Doctor Van Helsing (Peter Cushing). Fun anachronisms abound, from the optimistic belief that the Berkshire countryside plus an overzealous smoke-machine equal rural Transylvania, to Van Helsings worrying assurance that the best way to recover from a blood transfusion is to consume plenty of tea, coffee or even betterwine. One shouldnt be brutal about a film of such noble intent, but as horror it doesnt have the honest-to-goodness scares that modern audiences expect. Still, Christopher Lees Dracula is a menacing and complex presence who never lets his fangs and cape dominate. Theres also the canny use of vampirism as an allegory for drug abuse and sexually transmitted disease: is this the camp forerunner to Abel Ferraras The Addiction?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Rocha's first major film introduced most of the methods, themes and even characters that were developed five years later in his <i>Antonio das Mortes</i>. Set in the drought-plagued Brazilian Sertao in 1940, it explores the climate of superstition, physical and spiritual terrorism and fear that gripped the country: the central characters, Manuel and Rosa, move credulously from allegiance to allegiance until they finally learn that the land belongs not to god or the devil, but to the people themselves. The film's success here doubtless reflects the 'exoticism' of its style, somewhere between folk ballad and contemporary myth, since the references to Brazilian history and culture are pervasive and fairly opaque to the uninitiated. But Rocha's project is fundamentally political, and completely unambiguous: he faces up to the contradictions of his country in an effort to understand, to crush mystiques, and to improve.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Kurosawa was pressured by his producers into directing this sequel to <i>Yojimbo</i>, and rose to the occasion by making his funniest and least overtly didactic film. The plot has Sanjuro (Mifune) running lazy rings around nine would-be samurai and two genteel ladies while cleaning up a spot of corruption in local government. Kurosawa plays most of it for laughs by expertly parodying the conventions of Japanese period action movies, but the tone switches to a magnificent vehemence in the heart-stopping finale.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Miyazaki's first digitally animated feature (the highest-grossing Japanese film ever) initially seems like a <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i> fantasy, but rapidly picks up a resonance, weight and complexity that make it all but Shakespearean. Chihiro, a sullen and resentful 10-year-old, is moving house with her parents when they stumble into the world of the Japanese gods - where the greedy parents are soon turned into pigs. Chihiro bluffs her way into a job in the resort spa run by the sorceress Yubaba, but at the cost of her human name and identity; she becomes Sen. With her links to her own past slipping away, she finds an ally in Yubaba's factotum Haku, a mysteriously powerful boy who also has a lost identity behind him. Never remotely didactic, the film is ultimately a self-fulfilment drama that touches on religious, ethical, ecological and psychological issues. (There's also an undercurrent of satire: Miyazaki admits that Yubaba's bath-house is a parody of his own Studio Ghibli.) No other word for it: a masterpiece.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
Dean's finest film, hardly surprisingly in that Ray was one of the great '50s directors. The story, much imitated since, might sound like nothing much - unsettled adolescent from good home can't keep himself out of trouble, and gets involved with bad sorts until tragedy takes over - but what makes the film so powerful is both the sympathy it extends towards all the characters (including the seemingly callous parents) and the precise expressionism of Ray's direction. His use of light, space and motion is continually at the service of the characters' emotions, while the trio that Dean, Wood and Mineo form as a refuge from society is explicitly depicted as an 'alternative family'. Still the best of the youth movies.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A monumental hospital soap opera which looks exactly as though Kurosawa had taken a long look at <i>Ben Casey</i> and <i>Dr Kildare</i>, and decided that anything they could do he could do better. One has to reckon, however, with the fact that the Japanese Dr Gillespie, alias Red Beard, is played by Toshiro Mifune, and that Kurosawa really can do things better than most. While Red Beard busily demonstrates to his reluctant young intern that caring for the poor is more rewarding than a society practice, the film bowls along magnificently in a weird mixture of genuine emotion, absurdity and poetic fantasy. Perhaps only Kurosawa could have brought off the scene in which Red Beard, thwarted in one of his good works, erupts into a samurai frenzy, knocks out some 20 men, breaks arms and legs like matchsticks, and ends with a gravely shamefaced mutter: 'I think I've gone too far'.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Far from being just another vehicle for Mifune, this belongs in that select group of <i>films noirs</i> which are also comedies. It's not as uproarious as its sequel <i>Sanjuro</i>, but the story of a mercenary samurai selling his services to two rival factions in a small town, and then sitting back to watch the enemies destroy each other, certainly marks a departure from the predominantly sentimental moralising of earlier Kurosawa movies. Ultra-pragmatic, unheroic Sanjuro is the centre-piece: his laziness matches the sleepiness of the town, his quirky mannerisms echo the town's gallery of grotesques, and his spasms of violence reflect the society's fundamental cruelty. If the plot sounds familiar, it's probably because Leone stole it for <i>A Fistful of Dollars</i>.]]></review>

One of the most lightweight (and not even particularly deceptively so) of Hitchcock's comedy-thrillers; a retreat from the implications of <i>Rear Window</i> into the realm of private jokes and sunny innuendo, with a Cte d'Azur romance that hinges on Kelly's testing of retired high-line thief Grant, to find whether 'The Cat' has indeed been neutered or is still able to prowl the Riviera rooftops. Even determined analysts Rohmer and Chabrol had to take comfort in celebrating Hitch's 'flowers of rhetoric': the famous image of the cigarette stubbed out in an egg, and the cheeky clich of cross-cutting foreplay and fireworks.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A characteristically pessimistic account of human aspiration from Kubrick, this tripartite sci-fi look at civilisation's progress from prehistoric times (the apes learning to kill) to a visionary future (astronauts on a mission to Jupiter encountering superior life and rebirth in some sort of embryonic divine form) is beautiful, infuriatingly slow, and pretty half-baked. Quite how the general theme fits in with the central drama of the astronauts' battle with the arrogant computer HAL, who tries to take over their mission, is unclear; while the final farrago of light-show psychedelia is simply so much pap. Nevertheless, for all the essential coldness of Kubrick's vision, it demands attention as superior sci-fi, simply because it's more concerned with ideas than with Boy's Own-style pyrotechnics.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
Alan Sillitoe's fiction fuelled the excellent <i>Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</i>, but this one started life as a short story and grew flabbier for the screen. Courtenay's Borstal boy is crabbed and corroded by class hatred, and his only moment of satisfaction comes when he throws a cross-country race against a local public school to spite the upper class Governor (Redgrave). Chariots of Bile. Even in this softened-up version, <i>Time</i> found the hero 'prolier-than-thou'. Most of the period hallmarks of the British New Wave are paraded here. The disaffected hero treats us to Hoggartian interior monologues and climbs the nearest hill so that we can see the hopeless urban sprawl - Nottingham, in this case - laid out like his future. He gets the obligatory lyrical day off, a bracing trip to Skegness. Courting couples snog beside the barbed wire, and there's no shortage of editing between lads being flogged and choirs singing 'Jerusalem'. The general thrust is that Britain provides no sustenance for the working class soul, and consumerism spearheaded by telly comes in for some stick. It all seems a long time ago.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Jazz saxophonist Fred (Pullman) is haunted by anxiety about the fidelity of his wife Renee (Arquette) and the mysterious arrival of video recordings shot inside their house. Fred sees himself, on one tape, next to his wife's battered body, and is arrested for murder. Overnight, Fred vanishes, to be replaced by garage mechanic Pete (Getty), who hasn't a clue how he ended up in jail. To make matters more mystifying, Pete presently becomes involved with Alice (Arquette again), mistress of his gangster pal Mr Eddy (Loggia), leading him into a nightmarish intrigue which only gradually begins to connect, obscurely, with Fred. The plotting, with its inexplicably metamorphosed protagonist and its various doubles, makes one suspect Lynch may be having us on. It's ironic, then, that narrative is the most intriguing thing about the film, leading us either to dismiss it as pretentious rubbish or to try to make sense of it on a metaphorical level. Fortunately, Lynch's mastery of mood through sound, space, decor and lighting means that we're more or less engrossed throughout, even though some of the sillier moments - not to mention the uncharacteristically clumsy use of music - try one's patience.]]></review>

The Brooklyn congresswoman exhibited few illusions of winning, but adhered to Martin Luther Kings advice: that the most radical act black Americans could undertake during the civil rights movement would be to assert the full level of [their] citizenship. Lynchs fast-paced documentary casts yet another withering glance at Americas deathless winner-takes-all system, which marginalises all but the most moneyed and establishment-endorsed candidates.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This latest campaigning documentary on the illiberal activities of Silvio Berlusconi  twice Italian prime minister and controller of his countrys second most powerful conglomerate, Fininvest  condemns the media mogul for the greatest crime of all: the little guy cant take a joke. Comedian, impersonator and self-proclaimed buffoon Guzzanti  Italys answer to Rory Bremner (who features here, doing his Tony Blair number)  had her satire show, RAIot, swiftly taken off the air by her RAI (Italys BBC) bosses. A landmark ruling suggested satire could be libellous; her superiors got cold feet and ditched her programme for being unfunny. <br />Guzzantis lively documentary traces her enquiry into this act of censorship. In her own country, she interviews TV execs, academics, betrayers from the previous centre-left coalition (who, she claims, paved the way for Berlusconis unprecedented corporate control), eminent journalists sacked by Signor B and fellow satirists (including Dario Fo); further afield (notably in France) she talks to other defenestrated hacks, politicos and media types. The result is an entertaining and pertinent, if egocentric, diatribe with some funny sketch material.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The African nation of Liberia had long suffered from internal tensions, but it was President Charles Taylor who exploited the populations class schisms and religious differences into seemingly endless civil war. Finally, in 2002, a group of Christian women decided they could no longer sit idly by. They formed a coalition that insisted Taylor and the warlord rebels who opposed him stop fighting; Muslim women echoed their counterparts demands for peace. Initially, the angry activists staged sit-ins and borrowed a page from <i>Lysistrata</i> (no sex until theres a cease-fire). They even coordinated a summit between the sides, physically preventing delegates from leaving until an agreement had been signed. These devout citizens might not have been able to pray the devil back to hell, but in the end, they helped depose a despot and gained political pull.<br /></p><p>Like a well-tuned <i>Dateline</i> episode, Gini Retickers documentary adheres to a no-nonsense journalistic route: News footage and first-person interviews are presented with minimal stylistic brouhaha. Not that a spoonful of sugary technique is a mustthe horror speaks for itselfyet such by-the-book filmmaking creates a dj vu effect.

      <review><![CDATA[Roald Dahl takes on green politics in this adaptation of his children's book: screenwriter John Goldsmith introduces the theme of rural conservation and injects topicality into a tale of post-war village life. But the basic conflict is more personal: between loveable poacher William (Irons) and crass, <i>nouveau riche</i> lord of the manor Hazell (Coltrane). Widower William runs a garage and lives in a caravan with his nine-year old son Danny (Samuel Irons). One day their peace is shattered when Hazell decides that all he surveys should become a housing estate, but his plans are thwarted by the fact that William's patch of land is smack in the middle of the estate. In the ensuing battle of wills, we can thrill to the dangers of poaching, and hiss at Hazell's dastardly schemes. Millar directs with authority and loving attention to period detail. There's also a pleasing ring of truth about the relationship built up between real-life father and son Jeremy and Samuel Irons. Family entertainment: cosy, intimate, a touch cloying.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Wide-eyed, streetwise Abby (Adams) and her lover come (amidst thousands of other croppers from the industrial north) to the startlingly fertile harvest landscape of World War I Texas. Once there, they are caught up in a diffident, ultimately fatal triangle with their ailing young landowner-boss (Shepard): these are the surreal, idyllic, numbered <i>Days of Heave</i>n. This strange fusion of love story, social portrait and allegorical epic, by the director of <i>Badlands</i>, is rooted like that film in recent history, and held together only by its voice-over commentary and staggering visual sense. Where it goes further is in a profound chilling of romantic style, which treats lovers and insects alike as they flit through the vast wheat fields at dusk. Eventually (with a plague-of-locusts climax and the lovers' flight) the narrative collapses, leaving its audience breathlessly suspended between a 90-minute proof that all the bustling activity in the world means nothing, and the perfection of Malick's own perverse desire to catalogue it nonetheless. Compulsive.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Without getting soppy or anthropomorphic, there's something about images of bottlenose dolphins that brings a lump to the throat. That beautiful domed head, the permanent smile, those tiny teeth, the mammal's complex language, and, above all, the dolphin's seemingly instinctive desire to interact with human beings. This sensational 2-D IMAX documentary (produced by the Everest and The Living Sea team) whisks us to the West Indies and Patagonia where its subjects are filmed in the wild, or while entertaining tourists at various research-based institutions. The documentary follows several marine biologists at work: Kathleen Dudzinski studies dolphin communication in the wild; Alejandro Acevedo-Gutirrez monitors their feeding habits off Costa Rica; Bernd Wrsig tracks migratory movements; while naturalist Dean Bernal takes a dip with his unusual companion, JoJo. It is ably narrated by Pierce Brosnan and aptly scored by Sting who has rearranged many of his Police songs for the occasion.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Stephen Herek's live-action remake of the Disney animated classic had bite and dash. The four writers of this sequel haven't, however, struck many new notes. With her outrageous coiffure and array of polka dot creations, Close is again good value as the rehabilitated, if not reprogrammed, Dalmatian furcoat collector, buying her way into Gruffudd's ramshackle London dog sanctuary. But the chimes of Big Ben cause a relapse. Gruffudd's girlfriend, probation officer Evans, is a very modern Miss; and with the addition of Depardieu's mad, bad couturier, Le Pelt, the film feels only tokenistically updated, and all the more absurd for it. Given that pacing and plotting are so misconceived - one frenetic scene follows another - you concentrate on the endless cute puppies. The limitless patience of the Evans and Gruffudd characters with the messy pooches makes you want to bark out loud. There's a lively sequence featuring a balloon rescue in London Zoo, good stunts, and designer Gorton pulls out all the stops for the finale inside the creaking machinery of an ancient Parisian cake factory, but the romance and humour are really quite perfunctory.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A thriller which begins, as it means to go on, with a bang. Only minutes after the preliminaries are over, a door bursts open, a shotgun is fired, and the victim is blasted clean off the bed into the wall behind him. The plot, concerning the battle of wits between an honest cop and an ambitious politician for possession of the key witness in a Mafia expos, is serviceable but nothing special. But the action sequences are brilliant, done without trickery in real locations (including a great car chase which spawned a thousand imitations) to lend an extraordinary sense of immediacy to the shenanigans and gunfights.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Uneven but entertaining World War II escape drama, which even when it first appeared seemed very old-fashioned. Based on Paul Brickhill's factual account of the efforts of Allied prisoners to break out of Stalag Luft North, it contains memorable sequences and a sea of well-known faces. McQueen comes off best as 'The Cooler King'; Bronson and Garner (perhaps surprisingly) give good support; Coburn is totally miscast as an Australian, yet turns in an amusing performance. Worth seeing the last half hour, if nothing else, for one of the best stunt sequences in years: McQueen's motor-cycle bid for freedom.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Stone's Vietnam film is a savage yet moving account of a 19-year-old's baptism under fire: clambering out of a transport plane, Sheen is soon plunged into the bloody chaos of combat. The use of his letters home as a commentary establishes personal experience as the core of the film; but broader political issues do manifest themselves when, unable to make any headway against the elusive Vietcong, the grunts turn their anger and weaponry on one another, the platoon splitting into warring factions that reflect peacetime social divisions. Two conflicting impulses appear in the movie: a desire to assault the audience with searing images that will cauterise the Vietnam wound once and for all; and a wish for a more artistically distanced elegy, given its purest expression in Georges Delerue's plaintive score. Perhaps it is this unresolved tension that allows <i>Rambo</i> fans to relish the violence while concerned liberals ponder the horror. That said, Stone's eye-blistering images possess an awesome power, which sets the senses reeling and leaves the mind disturbed.]]></review>

But he does have an engagingly dotty showbiz act, holding up a platform on which Terry Moore sits strumming 'Beautiful Dreamer' at a grand piano. The whole 'Golden Safari' nightclub show is rather a splendid piece of kitsch, complete with voodoo dancers, ten circus strongmen in leopard-skins pitted against Joe in a tug-of-war, and a spiritedly destructive rampage when three drunken revellers go backstage to ply the already resentful ape with a bottle. For all the sneers cast at the film, it's in fact surprisingly well crafted (Willis O'Brien, technical creator), with position of tongue in cheek perfectly judged.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[After the delightful<i> Muppet Christmas Carol</i>, this fourth Kermit and pals star vehicle comes as a slight disappointment, but it's a treat all the same. The format's unchanged. The pre-puppet warm-up, with black-toothed Saunders, slovenly 'kerchiefed Connolly and the rest of the sea dogs, is all slopped ale, menacing curses and roisterous yo-ho-ho, served up just short of Python-esque pastiche. The heart only leaps with the dockside arrival of Kermit's Capt Smollett and his kaleidoscopic crew of woolly friends as the movie sets sail for the usual ahistoric musical extravaganza. There's bad news. Kermit's role is upsettingly minor and underwritten. Worse, Miss Piggie's superstar status is becoming a crashing bore: her South Sea queen of the warthogs (Benjamina Gunn) favours ostentation over dignity. Yet Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil's musical numbers have more than enough goofy lyrics to cheer the cockles. Bishop comes off well, too, with his contemporary Jim Hawkins, sensible, winsome but thankfully not cute. The new star, and about time, is Rizzo the Rat. He's not as bright, witty or charismatic as Kermit, but what courage, what staying power!]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The Welsh valleys, 1911. Solomon (Gruffudd) is the son of a Jewish family which sells drapery and glazing. Times are hard for the pit community, not least in the household where Solomon strikes up a conversation with Gaenor (Roberts), whose father may soon be on strike with the rest of the miners. Knowing she's from chapel stock, Solomon poses as 'Sam Livingston', son of an English engineer, and the pair soon find themselves spending afternoons together in a hayloft. Eventually the strain of the pretence tells. A familiar theme, but the film's modest accomplishment is to place it in unfamiliar terrain. It all starts to go awry, however, when Gaenor's pregnancy is discovered, and soon melodramatic tribulation is being piled on hackneyed adversity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Reactionary pap the story may be, but Wises blockbuster musical is still grossly underrated (and frequently knocked by those whove never seen it). Its superbly edited and shot, Ernest Lehmans script keeps things moving along nicely, the Nazi threat is neatly handled, Andrews makes for a surprisingly determined heroine (even if her aim is merely to care for kids and stand by her man), and Eleanor Parker steals the show. This new digital print should do justice to that stunning mountaintop camerawork.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
Refused a US censor's rating, this adaptation of Hubert Selby's 1978 novel is as visually experimental and thematically uncompromising as director Aronofsky's first feature <i>Pi</i>. A relentless sensory assault threatens to overwhelm the viewer, but the visceral images and frantic editing capture the euphoric 'highs' and repetitive rituals of drug blighted lives, while drawing clear parallels between the characters' different forms of addiction. Aronofsky interweaves the tales of four Coney Island residents, each desperate to escape a dull existence. Burstyn gives a fearless, heartbreaking performance as Sara Goldfarb, a widow who shrugs off lethargy when promised an appearance on her favourite TV game show; but an amphetamine-based crash diet slowly disconnects her from reality. Her junkie son Harry (Leto) dreams of becoming a bigtime dealer with his friend Tyrone (Wayans). With the profits, Harry plans to open a clothes shop, based on his girlfriend Marion's designs. Burnished camerawork and ex-Pop Will Eat Itself head Mansell's part-punchy, part-elegiac score reinforce and counterpoint the increasingly nightmarish visuals.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Like Keaton before him, Tati devised gags of such sheer intricacy as to prove on occasion just too beautiful to be laughed at (it's no accident that the truly funniest talkies - Fields, the Marx Brothers - were hardly directed at all). In this, his first feature, reissued in its original 'splash colour' version (never shown at the time), an almost plotless tale of a village postman's endeavours to streamline his service <i> l'amricaine</i> is enhanced by a radiographic vision of rural minutiae which one might call hyper-realist, were it not for that term's sleek urban connotations. As for Tati the performer, he makes cycling along a tranquil country lane as spellbinding as if it were taking place on a high wire.]]></review>

The songs never take off into anything very much, the whole atmosphere (apart from the climax) is distinctly stagebound, and Huston merely reveals why he had never before in his long career been hired to make a musical.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Rocha's sequel to his own Black God, White Devil returns to the Brazilian Sertao in the period after 1940, the key year in which the last of the cangaceiro bandits was killed. The legendary 'warrior saint' Antonio is now the central character, and the movie celebrates his turn against the military regime that hires him, offering his righteous fight as a model for all revolutionary resistance. This time, though, Rocha completely rejects the elements of realism that made his earlier films particularly obscure: the movie is styled and paced like a Leone Western, and is as flamboyantly operatic as a Jancs parable. Interestingly, the lack of direct historical references makes the result all the more venomously agitational.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The first 'volume' (choice word) of Tarantino's magnum movie-magpie opus announced itself as 'The fourth film by Quentin Tarantino'. Does that make this companion piece - clocking in at a voluminous 136 mins - his fourth-and-a-half? His fifth? It feels like he's cramming in his sixth, seventh and eighth. Wait six years for one of the geek lord's genre riffs, and then a cartridge-belt of them comes along at once. Those turned off by the first part's reckless, relentless violent purges - and its brazen movie-saturated superficiality - aren't likely to find cause for conversion, but <i>Vol. 2</i> certainly broadens the tale's remit, even as it aims to deepen it. There's more genre shading - everything from Leone and Peckinpah Westerns, through Chinese martial artistry, to nihilist <i>noir</i>, set out like a fanboy flip book - but character and dialogue, too, to ground the outbursts of lethal action. There are more flashbacks to the Bride's backstory, more reflection ('We deserve to die,' Madsen's Budd rather movingly introspects, before reverting to trigger-happy trailer-trash type); Bill (Carradine) is revealed as a mean, melodious Tarantino archetype; all the while the Bride (Thurman) runs the gamut of life lessons, from up the aisle to back from the grave. Does it cohere? Is there a point? Hasn't the movies' great Orobos snake made a meal of his own tail? <i>KBV2</i>'s pathos is a stretch: I'm not sure about an assassin who flunks her assignment at the sight of a home pregnancy-test kit; nor about Tarantino's sentimental blue streak now, after all his merciless groundwork. But you have to admire the chutzpah with which he puts it over.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Since the antics of so many heavy metal bands already teeter on the edge of self-parody, it would have been no surprise if this spoof 'rockumentary' about a comeback tour by a has-been English rock group had turned out to be a one-joke movie. In the event, Reiner's brilliantly inventive script and smart visuals avoid all the obvious pitfalls, making this one of the funniest ever films about the music business. Filmed in <i>cinma vrit</i> style, it follows the group from venue to venue, observing the trials and tribulations of life on the road, personal tensions within the group, and problems with expanding egos. Interviews with the group fill in the details of their chequered musical career: they have trouble keeping their drummers, one of whom choked on vomit (somebody else's), while another spontaneously combusted on stage. Most importantly of all, the musical numbers acutely mimic the crashing drums, thudding bass lines, whining lead guitar solos, and juvenile, sexist lyrics of heavy rock.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Bespectacled nine-year-old Californian Tony Thompson (Lipnicki) has recently moved with his parents to a remote corner of Scotland, yet already he's plagued by nightmares about vampires and dark mythological occurrences. To his horror, a bat flies through his window and transforms itself into a vampire of similar age. Tony discovers, however, that not all vampires are nasty; like any mortal, they too have problems. The trouble is, Rudolph's problem is more pressing than most: his family (headed by Grant and Krige) is stuck in purgatory and desperate for the lad's help. This Burton-esque fantasy-cum-comedy thriller has plenty of bite, with just the right level of lightweight horror to give little ones a shock or two without inducing nightmares. Much of the film's success is down to the costume design, the novel SFX and the mildly foreboding atmosphere of the mist enshrouded Scottish countryside.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Simon Rattles love affair with the Berlin Philharmonic, arguably the classical worlds greatest orchestra, scored a triumph with an outreach experiment which combined 250 schoolkids in a performance of Stravinskys pounding primal ballet, The Rite of Spring. Remember the original Fantasias pre-history sequence, complete with battling dinosaurs? The same score provides the climax of this documentary chronicling five momentous weeks of preparation (too much for my review copy which flickered into panicky breakdown). The run-up features Rattle (faintly luvvy), the English choreographer (both pretentious and ruthless; when Germans want fun and Brits fiercely demand seriousness, you feel stereotypes have gone wrong somewhere). The kids, ranging from giggling scepticism to psychological withdrawal represent all backgrounds, including a Nigerian orphan, a bewildered refugee who thought all white people spoke English. The eventual result was reportedly inspiring for all concerned.

      <review><![CDATA[Its hard to find anything very positive to say about this uninspiring version of Ulysses. Joseph Stricks slightly leaden 1967 version of Joyces masterpiece at least had its fine Dublin location-work and caught some of the tumbling vitality of the exiles tribute to his city. Perhaps Sean Walshs day in the life of Jewish copy-taker Bloom (Stephen Rea, at his most crestfallen and Stan Laurel-esque) looked better on paper. Theres a funereal air to Blooms perambulations  to work, to library, pub and brothel. There are no epiphanies for Hugh OConors under-charged Stephen Dedalus, but Angeline Ball is suitably tarty as his cuckolding wife Molly, but it seems a mistake to open the film with her climactic Yes speech. The absence of acoustic sound,too, gives the film an eerie quality, declining into Jarman-esque camp in the foot-fetish fantasy of the Nighttown re-enactments.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Famously, film and TV adaptations of Jane Austens novels used often to be guilty of staid, lazy, Sunday-afternoonish reverence. Recent efforts have waxed loud about making her sexy or modern; this takes that tack to her best loved book, offering both appropriately youthful stars and a purportedly realist portrayal of Regency England as gritty and grungy rather than rosily picturesque.Its not an unintelligent attempt, with Wright (following TV acclaim with this feature debut) and writer Deborah Moggach alert to demands for naturalism: early scenes of the Bennets preparing for and attending a boisterous ball are so pacy, buzzy and giggly, you wonder whether Austens meticulous narrative structures been jettisoned. It hasnt. Sadly, however, her brilliant sense of irony has; romantic melodramas played up at the expense of her razor-sharp wit, so humour is largely confined to Brenda Blethyn (broad) and Donald Sutherland (muted) as the Bennet parents and Tom Hollander, in perhaps the only turn to hit just the right note, as Mr Collins.Keira Knightley doesnt really convey Lizzies strength, let alone her complexity, while Darcys shift from surliness to love is too sudden for Matthew MacFadyen to convince. Family and friends are too sketchy (though Judi Dench leaves her mark as Lady de Bourg), just as England conveniently comprises famed statelies (Burghley, Chatsworth) and a cliff in the Peak District that gives Keira a Titanic shot. Meanwhile, history and Austens philosophical concerns are pushed into the background by further rhetorical flourishes like Darcys misty-meadow stride, with rising music, towards a new-day kiss. A realist Austen? Not exactly.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This adaptation of Cornelia Funkes kids story unravels within a pretty Venetian setting and involves Oliver Twist-inspired child thieves, a long-nosed roof-top-flitting Peter Pan figure and a magical merry-go-round with the power to reverse or advance the ageing process. The convoluted plot centres on two orphans on the run from their cantankerous uncle and aunt. They hook up with the Thief Lord (Rollo Weeks) and spend most of the film evading their relatives hired private dick before a wooden wing belonging to said merry-go-round leads towards a predictable fantasy finale. The storys dull, the dialogues empty, the performances are pretty crummy, the editings slipshod, the scores bombastic, and for some reason everyone speaks with an unmistakably British accent  except for one extra, a maid, who answers the door with a genuine Italian accent. Whats that all about? Most disappointing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In a market crowded with CGI-laden animations, this 2D family feature certainly stands out. It is, quite literally, an echo of a bygone era, based on the childrens books that Margret and HA Rey launched in the 1940s. A mischievous prankster, chimpanzee George is lifted out of his lonely existence in the African jungle when mild-mannered explorer Ted (voiced by Will Ferrell) comes looking for a famed giant idol to save the fortunes of his beloved museum in New York. Complications ensue when the idol Ted returns with is tiny, and Georges presence in New York does little to help  initially, at least. The plots slightly dull, but George provides light entertainment for young kids eager to live out their fantasies (flying over the city hanging on to balloons, etc). This, along with a catchy soundtrack from Jack Johnson, should endear parents to Curious George: its good old-fashioned family entertainment. The fact that it only pays lip service to the knowing humour typical of the Ice Age and Shrek franchises may or may not detract from its appeal.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Having (inevitably) had The Circle and Crimson Gold banned in Iran, Jafar Panahi again displays disdain for his censors with a righteously provocative critique of the Islamic Republics oppressive treatment of women.  Prepared in advance and shot in a semi-documentary style on the day of the Iranian football teams 2005 World Cup qualifying tie against Bahrain, it begins with a young girl on a bus travelling to the match in the company of likewise excited male fans  the crucial difference being that, unlike them, she isnt legally allowed to attend. Like other females  some of whom resort to drag in their determination to see the game  she must first persuade a tout to sell her a ticket,  then avoid the body-search guards encircling the stadium, and then hope she wont be betrayed by the male spectators<br />Thats if she gets in. Most of the film takes place in a compound guarded by soldiers just outside the stadium, where women whose gender has been discovered await removal for official sentencing. As the feisty Tehrani females protest the injustice of their situation with markedly less sophisticated provincial soldiers, Panahi underlines the absurdity of the regimes double standards with scenes that are sometimes comic  a girl is escorted to the mens loos which, of course, must be evacuated first  sometimes shaded by tragedy. The film isnt as consistently funny as it might be, and the peculiar cirumstances of its making means that its narrative sometimes feels fairly wayward, but theres no denying its rough, rousing power or its relevance as an illuminating social document. One things for sure: football fanatics behave pretty much the same everywhere.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Little Red Riding Hood gets the Rashomon treatment in this chipper family animation unravelling events from four different points of view. A mysterious Goody Bandit has been stealing from the forests sweet shops, but the local cops more immediate concern is a domestic disturbance at Grannys cottage. There, they find Red (a sharp little pipsqueak, voiced by Anne Hathaway), Granny (Glenn Close), the Wolf (Patrick Warburton) and the axe-wielding Woodsman (Jim Belushi). Naturally, events are not as they might seem, and flashbacks flesh out the characters as their recent actions are revealed. Despite the relatively rudimentary animation, its a breezy, passably funny spin on a childrens classic, mixing slapstick and farce with character humour and delighting in demolishing stereotypes. Sweet little Granny is a secret extreme-sports fanatic, for example, while the Woodsman turns out to be an aspiring actor doing the casting-call circuit. The story itself is slight, more concerned with farcical set pieces and cop-drama parody than a gripping plot. This is fairy-tale revisionism for junior MTV fans: speedy, irreverent and forgettable fun.]]></review>

Its a fucking shithole! fires back his new, younger room-sharer and fellow hitman-on-the-run Ray (Colin Farrell). Thus begins the running joke of ex-theatre wunderkind Martin McDonaghs clever, savvy and enjoyable revamp of the odd-couple/gangster caper, a genre picture confident its own audience-pleasing verbal sparrings, joke-enabling moral sophistry and tongue-in-cheek classical and cinematic borrowings  from Hieronymus Boschs Last Judgement to Nic Roegs Dont Look Now and every belfry, picaresque canal and famous seventeenth-century building in the Venice of the North.<br />Its mock-artistic thriller trappings notwithstanding, In Bruges is basically a funny, tragicomic two-hander, with the casting of Farrell alongside Gleeson enabling a pleasing Irish inflection: culture-vulture old pro Ken and philistine loose cannon Ray are Dublin-accented, London-Irishmen with shared guilty pasts awaiting fate in the person of psychopathic boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes as an enjoyable, mumbling Mamet-ian figure with a suicidal sense of honour). <br />McDonagh adeptly milks the situation comedy of the mismatched pair with the clock running down  as in Edouard Molinaros film A Pain in the Arse  lacing his drama with cheeky racist-dwarf jokes and dextrous set-pieces (notably an amusing face-to-face encounter out of Michael Manns Heat). But the films real pleasure lies in McDonaghs verbal felicity  the naturalistic dialogue is a breath of fresh air  and while Farrell struggles to juggle his humorous thick persona with romantic pathos, Gleeson excels in his role as the weary gangster pondering the possibilities for his own shot at redemption.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Polish veteran Andrzej Wajda tackles an event close to his  and his countrys  heart in Katyn, a poignant drama that traces the lasting effects of a national tragedy, the memory of which started to warp almost as soon as it happened.<br />Wajdas father was among more than 20,000 Polish officers murdered by Soviet troops in 1940, many of them buried in the Katyn forest. In this fictional take on that tragedy, Wajda places special focus on the influence of malevolent politics on the impossibility of any resolution for the victims families. As we learn, sometimes through excellent use of archive footage, when the soldiers bodies were first discovered in 1943, the Soviets blamed the Nazis; then, when Poland fell under the USSRs influence after 1945, any attempt to blame the Soviets was so strictly outlawed that, as we see, any mention even on a gravestone of the correct date of the massacre was brutally punished.<br />Wajda reflects this fog of truth in the story of Anna, the wife of a Polish officer who knows her husband is a Soviet POW, but who, even after a list of the dead is released in 1943, does not know whether or not he died at Katyn. Although Wajda introduces several other women, young and old, each closely affected by Katyn, its the story of Anna and her husband which offers a backbone to the film, along with intermittent, reverent and serene scenes of the POWs, whose grim fate Wajda reserves for the films final chapter. But some other characters, although instructive, feel like misplaced footnotes.<br />The principal success of Wajdas stately, widescreen and exquisitely shot film lies in its sober attempt to mirror the fragmented truth of a genocide. For half a century, the perception of Katyn was clouded by ideology: it was a distortion whose ripples were felt at the most intimate of levels. Wajda is excellent at portraying the lingering corruption of this top-down rewriting of history. On the downside, he tries to reflect so many experiences in his time-hopping story that he clouds our view at times.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An armful of awards from Cannes, Edinburgh and elsewhere have flagged up Luca Puenzos debut feature as something special. And it is. The subject matters unusual, tracing the dilemma faced by parents of a teenage hermaphrodite as resurgent masculine hormones threaten to change Daddys girl for ever. <br />More remarkable though, is the confidence and maturity of its approach, since what might have been preachy or even sensationalist proceeds through generous empathy for its various parties, played out amid evocative surroundings on the rugged coast of southern Uruguay. In an extraordinary central performance, actress Ins Efron turns her characters specific personal issue into a volatile expression of universal adolescent anxieties, her mannish frame a walking index of androgynous uncertainty, her feelings churning over both an alienated present (the family moved from Buenos Aires to keep her from harm) and a future that promises transformation intowhom exactly?<br />That great Argentinian actor Ricardo Darn anchors the proceedings brilliantly as the marine biologist father who thinks his daughter is perfect as she is, but knows surgery and medication would be required to sustain her femininity  hence the presence in this remote enclave of a visiting surgeon and his disaffected teenage son (Martn Piroyansky, another fearless contribution). Their curdled filial relationship in turn offers another angle on parents too ready to define their children through their sexuality, and further encourages understanding for those outside conventional definitions. <br />Like Claire Denis best work, the film is alive to the precise emotional tenor of every moment as it unfolds, which it does unpredictably, provocatively and with affecting reserves of compassion.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Chloe (Drew Barrymore) is a typical LA princess, lounging by the pool, having her hair done and patronising the help. But Chloe is also a dog: the beloved Chihuahua of Viv (Jamie Lee Curtis), who entrusts Chloe to her niece Rachel (Piper Perabo) while shes away. One girls trip to Mexico later and Chloe is in the hands of dognappers. At this stage, most adults will be happy to leave the bitch there, but the plot demands that Chloe begins the long trip to home and wisdom (ie, dont be rude to Mexicans because theyre poor).<br /><br />So: lazy script, annoying heroines, cultural stereotypes this should be a one-star family comedy. But theres absurd appeal in a big musical number: a choreographed Chihuahua dance in Mayan ruins. When it acknowledges its naffness, this has the potential to be an ironic cult hit. But the sappy half of this mixed-up movie is strictly for kids.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Every so often, the Hollywood elite get tired of the two-acre trailer and bottomless Champagne Jacuzzi and feel the urge to get down and dirty in the indie trenches where real movies are made. In the past year or so weve seen Julia Roberts in heartfelt family drama Fireflies in the Garden, Jennifer Aniston in heartfelt family drama Management and now its Alec Baldwins turn, taking the production reins and showiest role in  you guessed it  heartfelt family drama Lymelife.<br />The film displays all the expected characteristics of a first-time directors long-gestating pet project: recent-ish period setting? Check. Parental wrongdoing? Check. Coming-of-age antics? Check. The setting is early-80s Long Island, where shaggy-haired Star Wars nerd Scott (Rory Culkin) struggles to deal with the breakdown of his family unit in the wake of dad Alec Baldwins affair with neighbour Cynthia Nixon, whose prissy daughter Adrianna (Emma Roberts) Scott also happens to be in love with.<br />All a bit The Ice Storm, then, and theres the problem. With its autumnal East Coast setting, bedhopping hijinks and misanthropic outlook, Lymelife never manages to feel like more than a pale reflection of Ang Lees masterpiece, retaining the emotional integrity and immaculate period decor but falling far short in terms of insight or intelligence. There are some lovely moments, most of them deriving from a brace of pitch-perfect performances, notably Kieran Culkin as Scotts punchy older brother, but the script never coalesces, meandering aimlessly through a series of bust-ups, break-ups and blazing rows towards a wildly unconvincing shock finale. Solid, but forgettable.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For those who like the tone of their films to be reflected in the hairstyles of their lead actors, the wayward shock of auburn-red frizz worn by Sabine Azma in Wild Grass is a good first step to unravelling this joyfully skittish farce from 88-year-old maestro Alain Resnais. Combining the verbose theatrical games of his 80s films with the time, space and character manipulations of early classics such as Last Year at Marienbad, Wild Grass also feels like Resnaiss ode to something like Twin Peaks  a work which is inviting and gentle on the surface but inscrutable and strange the more you look at it. <br />Its based on a surreal novel by French author Christian Gailly called LIncident and details the fallout of a preposterous romance that forms between antisocial house husband Georges Palet (Andr Dussollier) and dentist-cum-budding aviatrix, Marguerite Muir (Azma) when her purse is snatched and he recovers it. Every frame is filled with blushed neon hues that look like theyve been filmed through a smear of Vaseline. The kinetic camera hovers and glides around scenes, at one point even leaping over the top of a house. These stylistic elements  along with a dainty, midi-jazz score  lend the film a dreamlike quality. Whats it all about, though? It could be everything and nothing. There are allusions to psychosis, chaos, reincarnation, anxiety, communication and even the romanticised nature of cinema itself. Its cheeky and confident, maybe one of the directors finest, and its loopy final line is the cryptic cherry on this oddball gteau.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p><i>Click here to read our interview with the director of 'Moon'<br /></i><br />We know that Duncan Jones is David Bowies son, but, more importantly, is his feature debut any good? The answer is a resounding  if qualified  yes, judging by this 1970s-sci-fi throwback, which, for a modern space movie about the knock-on effects on man of future technology, is unusually thoughtful, good-looking and well-acted. Sam Rockwell (below) is Sam Bell, a nervous lone astronaut on the moon where, at some point in the near future, a corporation is mining Helium-3, now the source of most global energy. Its Bells job to manage this operation in the company of a sympathetic robot called Gerty (one of several nods to 2001: A Space Odyssey). When we first meet him, Bells three-year stint is almost complete, but hes tired and unhinged  symptoms, no doubt, of solitude and having to communicate with his wife and young child by taped messages as the satellite is broken<br />If that last fact sounds a bit too convenient, thats the point: all is not what it seems. Jones has created a credible theatre in which to stage a meditative play on isolation and identity within the bounds of wild fiction, the edges of which are curiously blurred. Less is more in Joness eye: he knows that big ideas can be lost amid noisy gestures so keeps his drama within the confines of a few rooms, with only the odd, more poetic moment unfolding outside on the moons surface. As the film goes on, early ideas about loneliness segue into a more troubling (and confusing) study of corporate exploitation and even  heres a biggie  what it means to be human, when a second Sam Bell, a clone also played by Rockwell, appears and shakes up all perceptions of whats going on. The film is not entirely logical, but it raises pleasing questions and looks beautiful.</p><p><i><i>Click here to read our interview with the director of 'Moon'</i></i> <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Many actors have played the Woody Allen role in Woody Allen movies besides Woody Allen, and with mixed success: for every John Cusack in Bullets Over Broadway, theres a Kenneth Branagh in Celebrity. In Allens latest film, Whatever Works, Larry David assumes the role of the sharply observant, neurotically indignant, endearingly curmudgeonly nebbish, and as casting its a qualified success: David brings a spiky sense of mischief that sidesteps the self-pity to which the role might tend, but he also remains so aloof from the action that it can be hard to engage emotionally with the characters predicament.<br />A former Columbia University physicist and Nobel near-miss, Boris Yelnikoff (David) leaps from a window in despair at his comfortably futile existence but survives (you cant win em all). Before long, hes shacked up downtown with Melody (Evan Rachel Wood), a ditzy waif from Mississippi whose artless wonder threatens to chip away at his ingrained misanthropy even as the caricatured types who arrive in her wake (including parents Ed Begley Jr and Patricia Clarkson) seem determined to confirm it.<br />Whatever Works is Allens first film set in his trademark location of Manhattan since 2004 and the tone is relaxed, even if Allens sense of the city, once so romantic, can feel as pantomimic as his takes on London and Barcelona. The broadness of the antic characters he sends to cross Boriss path and the crises and reversals to which they fall subject are too exaggerated to engage as drama, and those who are uncomfortable with Allens tendency to pair nubile girls with ageing men will find little relief. But for all its wobbles, Whatever Works is rooted in an agreeable sensibility: life favours fate over luck more than wed like to think, so grab whatever chances of happiness come your way.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of a handful of great artists working in French cinema today, Claire Denis returns to Africa for the first time since Beau Travail for a mesmerising portrait of civil war, racial tension and one womans resistance to change in an unnamed, French-speaking African country. Isabelle Huppert lends her poetic resolve and earthy beauty to Maria, a woman trying to squeeze one last week out of her dilapidated coffee plantation even as her workers drift away and the possibility of violence or death becomes increasingly likely.<br />The film opens with unplaceable scenes of fire and death before we see Maria ignoring the pleas of a French army helicopter for her to leave. Her staff are abandoning her, but Marias response is to recruit new help. She forces her son Manuel (Nicolas Duvauchelle) to leave his bed and argues her corner with her louche ex-husband Andr (Christopher Lambert), who, like her sick father-in-law, Henri (Michel Subor, physically channelling the rot of his characters position), lives in the same area. Old friends become new enemies, and trust drains from the community in the same way that blood seeps from the wounds of a rebel soldier called The Boxer (Isaach De Bankol), who is hiding in the lush countryside.<br />Its a war film  but its a war film by Claire Denis, which means that a feeling of unease replaces any sense of clarity on our part towards what were seeing. This means theres a complexity and unknowability to all her characters, and above all to Maria, so were never able fully to judge or understand them. What arises from the films damp, steamy chaos is a sense of war as a creeping, unnatural force, a growing disease rather than an event. Of the films many startling images, the sight of young soldiers, dressed in green, emerging from foliage to the sound of Denis favourite Stuart Stapless music, suggests nothing other than an emerging virus.<br />Our challenge is to consider if, or why, Maria should continue to fight her corner  a question which Denis asks us to answer purely in human terms by keeping the political and personal framework of her story hazy. Neither a heroine nor a fool, Deniss Maria is a mirror to a world where the colour of ones skin is a silent issue in times of peace but a reminder of real divisions in times of war. Thats what the title hints at: we hear a kid call a fancy lighter he finds white material, but its also used as a term of derision on the rebels radio broadcasts which Denis includes as a rooting device akin to voiceover.<br />Underlying the film, one feels theres a great deal of subtle self-reflection by Denis, a woman who grew up in Africa, white, like Maria, in a black land. The film is not autobiography or memoir, but its themes are very personal to her and there are the odd, startling moments when Huppert, fragile in stature but tough in spirit, with flashes of unkempt hair, looks a bit like Denis  moments as haunting as the film itself.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Those who enjoy the mere presence of Isabelle Huppert in a film should gain something from this mildly interesting but far too spare French drama about Ann, a middle-aged pianist and composer (with small hints of Hupperts character in The Piano Teacher) who cuts all ties with her past after witnessing her husband, Thomas (Xavier Beauvois), kissing another woman. A tense opening chapter, followed by a speedy portrait of the realities of changing ones life, is far more satisfying than much of what comes later as Huppert confides in an old, gay friend and sets off on a journey that takes in Germany, Switzerland and finally Italy, where she settles into a small clifftop home and the film adopts a more symbolic mood. A growing reliance on ellipsis gives the film an episodic style that makes it feel as if were watching snippets from a long-running series and increasingly it feels like the film has little to say about its subject.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>You may not have noticed, but many honey bee populations are on the verge of extinction. Pennsylvanian beekeeper David Hackenburg was the first to sound the alarm in 2005 when he noticed many of his hives were being abandoned. Now the mysterious phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder is proving a serious, global issue: the bee is responsible for the pollination of a third of all fruit and veg. </p><p>No single answer is given here, but the three fingers of blame point to pesticides, monoculture and the artificial insemination of queens. The filmmakers tackle a niche subject by presenting the film as a storybook, with each chapter represented by a turn of the page. The thoughts of scientists and beekeepers mingle with cheaply animated sequences and news clips, but theres little form to the structure, the editing is amateurish and the narration is puerile. Its a worthwhile subject  but the film is too poor to justify a release.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Part altart-history lesson and part pilot for CSI: <i>The Louvre,</i> Peter Greenaways deconstruction of Rembrandts 1642 painting <i>The Night Watch</i> contends that the work isafter the Mona Lisa, Da Vincis <i>The Last Supper</i> and the ceiling of the Sistine Chapelthe fourth best-known artwork in the world. He also suggests that the Dutch master had, within the dense framework of this ensemble portrait, embedded clues regardinga murder. [<i>Dum-dum dum!</i>] Greenaway himself pops up in small squares within the movies frame to point out how details like a phallic spear, multiple light sources and the use of Christian allegory all point to a homicidal cover-up. The filmmaker once studied to become a painter himself; apparently, hes harbored dreams of being an amateur sleuth as well. </p><p>Greenaway has delved into this subject before with his 2007 true-crime biopic <i>Nightwatching,</i> much of which gets trotted out here in the form of exhibits for we, the jury. The wholesale regurgitation of that earlier feature makes this documentary feel more like a companion piece than a stand-alone investigation, though the films conspiracy theories are still compelling. That is, when the director isnt hectoring viewers with his plummy baritone, moaning about societys visual illiteracy (inarguable) and how this has led to todays impoverished cinema (highly debatable). Tell it to John Berger, Pete. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[With Mat Whitecrosss feature debut, Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll in cinemas, the ICA has scheduled a week of screenings for his rigorous, sympathetic documentary on the experience of Burmese refugees in the UK. Made for Channel 4s True Stories strand, the film follows two families from the persecuted Karen tribe as they leave a Thai refugee camp for a new life in windswept Sheffield.<br /><br />Whitecrosss greatest strength is a steadfast refusal to make any ethical assumptions, or to use his story as an excuse for political grandstanding. For some of his subjects, this new life is a blessing, for others a curse, but its as much a matter of personality and adaptability as a failure of social services or a clash of cultures. Moving to Mars succeeds because of its unsentimental humanity: the film steps back and allows us to make up our own minds about these troubled, likeable, struggling characters.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Fathers know foolishness best in this culture-clash family comedy, which presides over a cursed union of slushy sentimentality and dim humour. Two lovebirds (Lance Gross, America Ferrera) wreak havoc among their clans by announcing their intention to marry. Such news upsets their not-so-proud pops  a playboy radio personality (Forest Whitaker) and a clingy car-restorer (Carlos Mencia)  who begin volleying racial and class-based insults at each other.<br />Paternal bickering and egomaniacal prejudices soon give way to slapstick fighting, which leads to clichd crises and reconciliations as predictable as the scripts slurs are tame. A variety of side players fulfil the stereotype quota, with African-Americans represented as party-hearty lotharios and Mexicans as traditionalist kooks. Aside from an uncomfortable Mencia, who cowers before the camera, the cast is efficient  though thats not the same as coming out of this unscathed. Itll take years of yeomans work for Whitaker to repair his reputation after allowing himself to be humped by a goat on Viagra.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>At first glance, you could mistake this for a mainstream Hollywood rom-com: handsome con artist accepts money from rich parents who want him to stand in the way of their beloved daughter and her unsuitable beau. He charms her, she realises she can do better, he invents a sob story about a broken heart and swiftly departs with a wallet full of cash. This, however, is a French film, so theres a blissful lack of Dane Cook types pedalling crude sex gags. Instead, we have the comically talented French thesp Romain Duris as the charming Alex, and Vanessa Paradis as Juliette, his latest mark  a woman who could actually break his heart. Juliette is engaged to a posh Brit, Jonathan (Andrew Lincoln, not great), but her dad objects, and assigns Alex to intervene and pose as her bodyguard.</p><p>Its an instantly amusing set-up: Duris is terrific as the suave trickster assisted by his sister and her husband, a comical duo who set up surveillance devices to research Alexs targets. The opening scene is hilarious: Alex poses as a heartbroken doctor delivering medicine to needy villagers, all of whom are in on the act. For Juliette, he must memorise the Dirty Dancing routine and Wham! lyrics. More farcical laughs come courtesy of Juliettes drunken nympho friend, who inconveniently sets her sights on Alex. Problem is, Alex and Juliette never look like a credible love match. Paradis is an enigmatic presence, her characters true feelings never apparent. When Heartbreaker goes for real romance, it falters. When it goes for laughs, it hits the mark. A mixed bag, then, but still an accessible comedy that outstrips its similarly conceived US counterparts.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Toning down, though not entirely ditching, the swathes of rough S&amp;M sex that featured in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo  the first movie to be made from Stieg Larssons trilogy  this sequel nevertheless drags us back into a world of breadknife-to-the-scrote feminism where sexual violence seldom goes without punishment. And again, its worth the price of admission alone to spend time in the company of Swedens premiere bisexual emo-sleuth, Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), as she gets tangled up in a hackneyed and unlikely plot where she must work out who has framed her for the murder of a journalist on the cusp of exposing a sex-trafficking ring.<br /><br />The title refers to an incident from Lisbeths childhood when she doused her abusive father in petrol and set him ablaze  an event, it transpires, whose consequences she must now face. <br />Offering less of a cut-and-dried storyline than the first instalment, this film spends its running time carefully arranging the narrative dominoes in order to  hopefully  have them topple in the third and final film (due in November). The only real advantage of seeing Dragon Tattoo first is that it gives depth and meaning to Lisbeths relationship with ruddy-faced reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), who works tirelessly to clear the name of his erstwhile paramour. Filmed in murky, grainy tones which chime nicely with the squalid demi-monde that Lisbeth is forced to frequent, the film is more sharply focused on fleshing out mood and character than it is supplying rudimentary twists at cosy junctures. Certainly, much of the story is Google-powered, but is that not to be expected from an ace computer hacker? And the debate regarding the films feminist credentials is rendered moot at the point where Lisbeth takes down a leering Hells Angel with an electric Taser to the trouser area.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Indias most intelligent and respected director, Tamilian Ratnams latest bilingual (Hindi/Tamil) film is solid and superior Bollywood entertainment. The bastard Beera (Bachchan) kidnaps the arrogant and fearless Ragini (Rai-Bachchan), wife of no-nonsense cop Dev (Vikram). On one level, the plot is dosa-thin: will Dev rescue Ragini safely? But this is a modern update on the revered Hindu epic Sanskrit text The Ramayana (c.300 BC). Ratnams characterisation kicks in after the first chase and thrills hour, giving us a feisty female protagonist who has to question her perception of her captor as either raavan (demon) or Robin Hood. Performances attract admiration, Oscar-winner A R Rahmans energetic rustic tunes charm and the cinematography of a monsoonal rural India is stunning. Unlike its mythological evil namesake, this Raavan is ravishingly good.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[After Hot Shots!, Austin Powers and Team America, is there still mileage in the slapstick action-movie pastiche? Based on a recurring Saturday Night Live sketch  itself inspired by 80s cheeseball spy show MacGyver  MacGruber sees SNL stalwart Will Fortes titular secret agent rousted from a jungle retreat and pressed into CIA service in an effort to track down Val Kilmers nuclear-warhead-wielding terrorist, Dieter von Cunth. That name typifies the kind of humour on offer: amusing enough the first time, but increasingly unfunny on the thirty-third. There are a handful of quality gags  most of them at the expense of mullet-man MacGrubers Clarksonesque fashion sense  and Forte surrounds himself with solid performers, notably Kilmer as the preening psychopath and Powers Boothe as a grouchy CIA bigwig. <br />But it all feels terribly routine, and as the script attempts to paper over the gaps between good gags with graphic sex, extreme violence and pratfalls, it becomes clear that this particular well has run bone dry.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Lee died making this supernatural rock-star revenge movie, and, after the lawsuits, recriminations and distribution problems, it has mopped up at the US box office. Lee had almost completed filming, so the thrust of the story (from James O'Barr's graphic novel) is intact. The footage has been bumped up with flashbacks, stand-in shots, and hi-tech tweaking whereby Lee was extracted from spare scenes and installed in new ones. It's unobtrusively done, but makes the action a touch repetitive. More radically, the sicko storyline has been softened, becoming an elegiac, not to say maudlin, portrait of lost love. This has, sadly, worked to the advantage of the film: what was once slick, vacuous and trashy is now shot through with a terrible post-production irony. This is a most morbid film, a twisted Gothic romance with shards of the original black wisecracking splintering through the portentousness. Visually, it's a treat; characterisation is sharp, particularly the nicely defined villains; and the action scenes, though soft-pedalled, still pack a satisfying crunch.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Salles' exhilaratingly relaxed re-creation of the epic voyage that young medical student Ernesto Guevara (Bernal) took around South America in 1952 together with the biochemist Alberto Granado (de la Serna) is both a light-touched examination of the kind of experiences that began turning the former into 'Che', and - thanks to the way the film crew welcomed the locals they encountered into the movie itself - a subtle reminder that the social and political problems facing Latin Americans back then are far from resolved. Often improvising along with his able and extremely charismatic actors, Salles concentrates on character and milieu rather than plot or 'message', so that even the duo's life-changing stay in an Amazonian leper colony is mercifully bereft of rhetoric and melodrama. Gautier's camera is adept at catching the telling glance or gesture, while Gustavo Santaolalla's music contributes to the overall freshness of the approach. Very fine indeed. (Based on <i>The Motorcycle Diaries</i> by Che Guevara and <i>With Che Through Latin America</i> by Alberto Granado.]]></review>

All is gothic doom and gloom to begin with, Ray June's b/w camerawork streaking the imposing mansion sets with dark shadow, but more and more light intrudes, brightening with master Stockwell's psychological regeneration (disarmingly insightful from a child performer), and culminating in a climactic <i>coup de cinma</i> when Technicolor proves the very essence of Life itself. MGM's production recalls <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, but there's some stiffness here and Garland is not eclipsed.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Still one of Wilder's funniest satires, its pace flagging only once for a short time. Curtis and Lemmon play jazz musicians on the run after witnessing the St Valentine's Day massacre, masquerading in drag as members of an all-girl band (with resulting gender confusions involving Marilyn) to escape the clutches of Chicago mobster George Raft (bespatted and dime-flipping, of course). Deliberately shot in black-and-white to avoid the pitfalls of camp or transvestism, though the best sequences are the gangland ones anyhow. Highlights include Curtis' playboy parody of Cary Grant, and what is surely one of the great curtain lines of all time: Joe E Brown's bland 'Nobody's perfect' when his fiance (Lemmon) finally confesses that she's a he.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Not merely the best of Arnold's classic sci-fi movies of the '50s, but one of the finest films ever made in that genre. It's a simple enough story: after being contaminated by what may or may not be nuclear waste, Williams finds himself slowly but steadily shedding the pounds and inches until he reaches truly minuscule proportions. But it is what Richard Matheson's script (adapted from his own novel) does with this basic material that makes the film so gripping and intelligent. At first, Williams is merely worried about his mysterious illness, but soon, towered over by his wife, he begins to feel humiliated, expressing his shame and impotence through cruel anger. And then his entire relationship with the universe changes, with cats, spiders and drops of water representing lethal threats in the surreal and endless landscape that is, in fact, his house's cellar. And finally, to the strains of Joseph Gershenson's impressive score, we arrive at the film's philosophical core: a moving, strangely pantheist assertion of what it really means to be alive. A pulp masterpiece.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[There's something strange going on in Santa Mira. Children don't recognise their parents. Husbands have become estranged from their wives. Mass hysteria? Mass alienation more likely. Dr Kevin McCarthy discovers the secret: pod people are colonising the earth, taking human form but dispensing with the soul. Shot in just 19 days, Siegel's economical adaptation of a Jack Finney story (script by Daniel Mainwaring of <i>Out of the Past</i> fame) is one of the most resonant sci-fi movies, and one of the simplest. It has been interpreted as an allegory against McCarthyism, though it could equally stand as anti-Communist. (In his book <i>A Siegel Film</i>, the director has nothing to say on the matter.) It's still a chilling picture, gaining over Phil Kaufman's smart remake by virtue of its intimate small town setting, and it has one of the greatest endings ever filmed. Too bad the studio insisted on adding a lame bookend framing device and voice-over narration to diffuse it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of Resnais' most underrated explorations of the tone of time and memory. Claude Ridder (Rich), a failed suicide, is visited by two men who invite his cooperation in an experiment (already tried with a mouse) to project him into the past to see if he can recapture a moment of his life (since he has no wish to live, and therefore has no future, he is the perfect subject). Indifferently he agrees, is whisked through a suburban no man's land to a laboratory, and - accompanied by the mouse as an experienced travelling companion - sets off on his weird, fairytale trip through time, only to become hopelessly lost. As the scientists frantically try to trace their missing guinea-pig, fragments of his past surface momentarily, recurringly. Beautiful, tranquil, but increasingly menacing clues to a love affair with a girl he may or may not have killed. The fragments remain teasingly uncertain, just out of Ridder's grasp, but his feelings lead him inexorably back to the key moment of suicide; and in the present, Ridder's body - the body of a man projected into his death - is found in the laboratory grounds. On one level a witty sci-fi adventure, on another a poetic apprehension of man's helpless entrapment by time, the film is perfectly summed up by the extraordinary last shot of the mouse, still caged by the glass dome in which it has travelled, standing with its paws spread out against the glass in mute appeal.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[HG Wells thought <i>Metropolis</i> to be 'quite the silliest film', but a decade later Alexander Korda gave him enormous creative freedom to write a movie version of <i>The Shape of Things to Come</i>, which turned out to be just as silly. However, like <i>Metropolis</i>, it isn't just silly. It is a spectacular production wherein Wells takes his 'science versus art' preoccupations into the future (as seen from the '30s); and to make it work, only lacks the kind of pure cinematic form which a Powell/Pressburger would have given it, for its scale and love of 'ideas' pre-figure their films and make it just as unique in British cinema history. In the realm of 'prophetic science fiction', it is a genre landmark.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This pathetic attempt at comic horror (deriving from an initial project to rework <i>Peter Pan</i> in vampiric terms) not only plays fast and loose with vampire mythology but also fails to deliver either frights or laughs. Soon after moving to the coastal town of Santa Clara with his mother (Wiest) and elder brother Michael (Patric), young MTV addict Sam (Haim) is warned against vampires by the two Goonies who run the local comic shop. Lured to a wild cave party, Michael gets his first taste of blood (out of a bottle?). Forewarned is forearmed, however, and when Michael starts wearing shades, sleeping all day and flying around, Sam and the comic kids reach for the holy water, garlic and wooden stakes. Directed with a cavalier disregard for intelligibility, this has to be one of the most anaemic vampire flicks ever made.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Mizoguchi's best-known work, based on two stories by the 18th century writer Akinari Ueda (often described as the Japanese Maupassant), was one of a handful of Japanese films to sweep up numerous awards at European festivals in the early '50s. Its reputation as one of Mizoguchi's finest works and a landmark of the Japanese 'art' cinema has remained undented ever since. The director's unique establishment of atmosphere by means of long shot, long takes, sublimely graceful and unobtrusive camera movement, is everywhere evident in his treatment of the legend of a potter who leaves his family to market his wares during the ravages of a civil war, and is taken in and seduced by a ghost princess. A ravishingly composed, evocatively beautiful film.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Best known here for Stolen Children (1992), Italian realist Gianni Amelio again proffers a potentially mawkish story of tainted childhood  this time, mercifully, with far less sentimentality than in the earlier film. The child here is 15-year-old Paolo (Andrea Rossi), who suffers from muscular dystrophy and has been living with his late mothers family ever since his father Gianni (Kim Rossi Stuart  no relation to the younger actor) abandoned him as a baby. Now, it seems, Giannis at last ready to take responsibility  on his first encounter with the boy, hes taking him for tests and treatment at a special childrens hospital in Berlin. Will he be up to the task? That his sons mostly a cheerful, independent sort helps more than it hinders (though it does both); useful too is advice offered by Nicole (Charlotte Rampling), whose daughter  also at the clinic  requires an unthinkable amount of time and attention. In the end, though, theres no single sure way of making such relationships work<br />Amelios film succeeds primarily because its not a sob-story about the suffering of the disabled, but a tougher take on the problems, pressures and pain faced by parents of children in need of unending, constant care. Working from a screenplay co-written with Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli (The Best of Youth), he sensibly builds the film around the charismatic Rossi, who responds with a beautifully open performance. At first Nicole appears too serenely wise, and there are implausible, needless contrivances (Gianni entrusted with taking abroad a disabled boy hes never even met), but overall this is a sensitive, intelligent, insightful movie.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It often feels like Asian filmmakers have more opportunity and inclination to move around and experiment with genres than their Western counterparts. A Korean director like Bong Joon-ho can make his name with icy serial-killer thriller Memories of Murder and solidify his reputation with goofy political monster smash The Host before shattering expectations entirely with his best work so far: Mother is a murder mystery, a melodrama, a black comedy, a heartbreaking tragedy, a keen social satire and much more.<br />The title role is one Joan Crawford might have played: a fierce matriarch devoted to her mentally challenged son Do-joon (Bin Won), whose world falls to pieces when he is arrested for the sexually motivated murder of a teenage girl. Her quest to prove his innocence forces our heroine (Kim Hye-ja, listed in the credits only as Mother) to take up arms against an all-male establishment, the dead girls enraged family and Do-joons crafty and duplicitous best pal Jin-tae (Goo-jin), an amoral layabout who provides some of the films most memorably shocking moments.<br />Bong juggles styles with insouciant skill, infusing his classic noir plotline with hints of Douglas Sirk melodrama, rainswept US indie realism and a brooding, blackly comic and almost Lynchian sense of a world spiralling out of whack. Kims performance captures perfectly the sense of a woman at odds with a society she cant or doesnt want to understand, her doomed quest leading her into ever darker and more uncompromising situations. Bold, unpredictable and quietly devastating, Mother is Bongs first masterpiece. Tom Huddleston]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When her father (Birol nel  arguably the gruffest presence in cinema today) is released from prison, young Stevie becomes a detainee within the confines of her own family who, unluckily for her, have selected a rural squat overrun with transients, gypsies and drifters as their smack-strewn stomping ground. As a disjointed memory scrapbook of growing up in hippy hell, the film works well enough, with first-time director Marais intent on leaving questions unanswered and keeping context to an absolute minimum. Its also severely lacking in focus, with three diffuse, unlovable and, in the end, indecipherable central characters who offer as little connection to each other as they do to a potential audience. The title  translated from Geman as unruly children  offers a neat double entendre, as Marais is obviously sticking it to the unchecked boisterousness of both the young and the old characters in the film, although the English title probably offers a better appraisal of the work as a whole.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Denis' extraordinary movie centres on Galoup (Lavant) who, while holed up in Marseille, recalls his time as a sergeant-major in the Foreign Legion. In the desert, he drilled raw recruits while quietly nurturing feelings of respect and love for his superior, Forestier (Subor). Then, with the arrival of Sentain (Colin), a soldier Forestier honoured for bravery, Galoup caved in to resentment, envy and hate. Though little is spelt out explicitly in this elliptical tale of repressed emotion leading to murderous jealousy, the film is admirably accessible and clear throughout. The director shows scant interest in the new recruit as an angelic incarnation of goodness - her concerns are with how a wide open colonial outpost may become a prison; how men may cope with an all-male society; how the physical may mirror the metaphysical. Hence, she and her team create a fixed, timeless world of mysterious, balletic rites, rippled with simmering homoerotic tensions. The intensity of mood and thematic resonance both derive almost entirely from the poetic juxtaposition of music and the stunning images of beauty and sustained, even surreal strangeness. Prepare to be blown away.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Special Treatment</i> is what the inmates of an alcoholic ward receive from their doctor/director - a dour regimen of psychodrama, physical jerks and Nietzschean will-to-power, dished out with the usual righteous sadism. A 'therapeutic' trip to a beer factory confronts authoritarianism with the more human desire for a little happy excess: the old joke of a piss-up in a brewery is crossed with some high-key political power-plays. If Paskaljevic's relentless focus on the nature of Fascism is a shade extended, it's tempered by some great moments of outrageous hilarity, playful echoes of Pirandellian illusion, an electric enactment of sexual politics from the wonderful Milena Dravic (the sex-warrior in <i>W.R.- Mysteries of the Organism</i>), and a conclusion of joyous anarchy. If Fassbinder's persistent cruelty gets you down, then see a film just as tough on the vanity of totalitarianism, but which genuinely likes people. CPea.]]></review>

A <i>film noir</i> from the Ealing funny man? But Mackendrick's involvement with cosy British humour was always less innocent than it looked: remember the anti-social wit of <i>The Man in the White Suit</i>, or the cruel cynicism of <i>The Ladykillers</i>? <i>Sweet Smell of Success</i> was the director's American debut, a rat trap of a film in which a vicious NY gossip hustler (Curtis) grovels for his 'Mr Big' (Lancaster), a monster newspaper columnist who is incestuously obsessed with destroying his kid sister's romance... and a figure as evil and memorable as Orson Welles in <i>The Third Man</i> or Mitchum in <i>The Night of the Hunter</i>. The dark streets gleam with the sweat of fear; Elmer Bernstein's limpid jazz score (courtesy of Chico Hamilton) whispers corruption in the Big City. The screen was rarely so dark or cruel.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Set in the French port of Ste, director Abdel Kechiches Couscous is a rich and quietly surprising portrait of that towns French-Tunisian community. Basically an ensemble piece, it pokes into the lives of the two extended families belonging to a separated, 60-year-old immigrant shipworker, Slimane (Habib Boufares). When unemployment hits, it is the grain and red mullet dish his estranged wife so lovingly prepares which he hopes may prove the central selling point of a new restaurant he plans to open on a reconditioned quayside barge.<br /><br />The special quality of Couscous doesnt lie in its story  its the kind of film where you wish for less story rather than more  but in how well it manages to immerse us in the lives of this relatively isolated microcosm. It provides a series of scenes that genuinely sparkle with life and spontaneity  notably a delightful, talky family lunch presided over by Slimanes wife, where cinematographer Lubomir Bakchevs mainly hand-held camera fast pans from close-up to close-up, beautifully capturing emotions on the wing.<br /><br />The performances, too, developed in extensive workshops, are superb, with two standouts. The first is Boufares, who is particularly touching and impressive as a prideful man coping in his own way with dislocation, disappointment and redundancy. The other is Hafsia Herzi as his adopted daughter, whose bolder, more street-wise manner belies an equal, if different, second-generation immigrants vulnerability to the problems of cultural assimilation.<br /><br />Finally, Kechiche is very successful at placing a gnawing tension at the heart of his film  not least the discomforting doubt over whether this reticent, flawed but deeply sympathetic old guy will succeed  even if he proves less adept at resolving it. The ending  to this writers mind  is dramatically and artistically misjudged, but, nevertheless, it remains a remarkable and thought-provoking work.<br />]]></review>

Marcus Dunstan, who co-wrote this and Saw IV, V and VI with his partner, Patrick Melton, makes his directing debut with this low-budget, high- concept home-invasion movie.

The masked psycho killers cypher-thin victims  reluctant hero, wealthy suburban couple, rebellious teen daughter and horny boyfriend  are jerked about like puppets in a sado-slapstick Punch and Judy show. Meanwhile, the cranked-up action becomes exhausting, the surprises more predictable, and the plot holes ever larger. Even for hardcore horror completists, this is no collectors item.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[If movies like Sin City and Kick-Ass endeavour to emulate the frame-by-frame visual immediacy of your average comic book, French provocatrice Catherine Breillat attempts a similar trick with Bluebeard but instead uses the ornate illustrations found in any leather-jacketed, golden-clasped storybook as her model. And in selecting Charles Perraults bite-sized folk tale of a homicidal old hermit and his cowering younger bride as her source material, Breillat has produced her funniest and most immediately pleasurable film to date.<br /><br />Were initially introduced to two cheery pre-teen sisters as they read aloud this romantic account of murderous lust from the confines of a cluttered attic. This framing device hints that what were about to see is based on memories from Breillats own childhood and its a version of Bluebeard into which she clearly channels her personal concerns, making her own tiny but significant stresses. <br />The strange sequence of events that leads recently destitute Marie-Catherine (Lola Creton) to accept the repugnant Bluebeards (Dominique Thomas) hand in marriage plays out in a series of gracefully shot and paced tableaux which come to life through a pair of wonderfully sad-eyed and mysterious performances from the leads. Toning down the aggressive sexuality of such previous features as Romance and A Ma Soeur!, Breillats film is no less barbed in its insights on the physical torments of love and the strains of sibling disunity. Her spare but lively re-creation of medieval France does not draw undue attention to itself (think Rohmers Perceval le Gallois without the plastic trees), and her droll critique of the scourge of patriarchy is refreshingly modern.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Before and after the war, Ealing Studios was famous for one thing: comedy. But in 1942, with Europe overrun and Jerry glaring hungrily across the Channel, they turned their talents to more important work, becoming, for a time, just one of the Churchill governments many unofficial propaganda outlets. The film equivalent of a Careless Talk Costs Lives poster, Went the Day Well? concerns an attempt by a platoon of German paratroops to lay the groundwork for the forthcoming Nazi invasion by infiltrating a sleepy English hamlet, and the wily villagers valiant efforts to disrupt their plans. <br />It remains a jawdroppingly subversive and efficient piece of work, as former documentarian Alberto Cavalcanti establishes, with loving care and the occasional wry wink, the ultimate bucolic English scene, then takes an almost sadistic delight in tearing it to bloody shreds in an orgy of shockingly blunt, matter-of-fact violence. Still truly unnerving, one can only imagine how terrifying it must have been for audiences facing the very real threat of Nazi enslavement.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Thoroughly old-fashioned disaster film about a <i>Daily Express</i> reporter who learns that the earth has been tilted off its axis by the impact of two simultaneous H-bomb tests. Its 'authentic' newspaper setting looks quaint now, but there's some effective atmospheric build-up to the big one as London swelters in fog and heat. Perhaps inevitably, given the period and the film's medium budget, the ending is a cop-out.]]></review>

Nearly 60 years on, Ealing's compendium of spooky tales remains scary as hell. The best of the five stories, which we see enacted as they're related in turn by guests at a country house, are Cavalcanti's 'The Ventriloquist's Dummy', with Redgrave possessed by his deceptively lifeless little partner, and Hamer's 'The Haunted Mirror', with the splendid Withers a reluctant participant as history repeats itself; least frightening, but amusing, are Radford and Wayne as typically obsessive sporting coves in Crichton's 'Golfing Story'. Best of all, however, is the overall narrative arc, with the framing story finally taking a headlong rush into a nightmarish realm almost surreal in its weird clarity and familiarity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[John Dolittle (Murphy) has a way with animals. His childhood was spent chatting to dogs - his father put it down to an overactive imagination - but by the time he'd married, fathered kids and become a physician, he'd forgotten his unusual gift. Then, one evening, he narrowly misses running over a dog. The disgruntled hound proceeds to give the quack a piece of his mind, and before he knows it, Dolittle's hearing voices from trees, dustbins and caf tables. Much to his chagrin, he can still communicate with the animal world. Everyone else, of course, thinks he's lost his marbles. Not surprisingly, Thomas's anthropomorphic comedy is as far from Hugh Lofting's sing-song original as it's possible to get. The thin storyline is a sideshow to some of the most realistic animatronic and computer effects to date. Not all the animal characters ring true, though, and some of the humour strays into crude, butt-sniffin' territory. But Murphy's likeable, the script's laden with a gaggle of one-liners, and there's even a vague message nestling beneath the zoological chaos.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
An underrated film, perhaps because it is less science fiction than a tale of 'once upon a time'. Where Ray Bradbury's novel posited a strange, terrifyingly mechanised society which has banned books in the interests of material well-being, Truffaut presents a cosy world not so very different from our own, with television a universal father-figure pouring out reassuring messages, and the only element of menace a fire-engine tearing down the road. A bright, gleaming childhood red, the engine is like a reminder of toyhood days; and as Werner's fireman hero goes about his task of destroying literature, his growing awareness of the almost human way in which books curl up and die in the flames gradually assumes the dimensions of a quest for a legendary lost treasure - movingly glimpsed as he slowly and painfully deciphers the title-page of <i>David Copperfield.</i> Here the rich, nostalgic pull of the past wins out over technocracy, and the film ends, as it began, with a scene lifted right out of time: a wonderful shot of the rebels - each dedicated to the preservation of a literary masterpiece by committing it to memory - wandering in contented, idyllic exile by the edge of a glitteringly icy lake.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Very nearly a corking sci-fi lark, kicking off from the premise that when a top scientist defecting to the West suffers brain damage in an assassination attempt, the only answer is to inject a miniaturised submarine and medical team through his bloodstream to deal with the clot on his brain. The voyage through the fantastic landscapes of the body is brilliantly imagined, with the heart a cavernous vault, tidal waves menacing the canals of the inner ear (caused when a nurse drops an instrument in the operating theatre), cyclonic winds tossing the sub helplessly about as the lungs are reached. The script, alas, is pretty basic, expending half its energies on delivering a gee-whiz medical lecture, the other on whipping up suspense around the mysterious saboteur who lurks aboard (and is so sweatily shifty-eyed that there isn't much mystery). An opportunity missed, therefore - especially as the imaginative sets are slightly tackily realised - but fun all the same.]]></review>

She continues the avenger role, but in much diluted form, simply exacting retribution for the murder of her narcotics officer boyfriend (gone is <i>Coffy</i>'s<i> </i>environment of all-pervasive and over-weening corruption); and in any case this is subsumed in a general racial tone, with every white within spitting distance made a bigot, for the sole purpose of milking audience reactions in the most blatant way possible. Grier is an actress able to convey an amazing and unflinching strength, and she reveals the film for the dross it is.]]></review>

The party scenes and intimations of hipness now look dated, and it's all rather too sugary for its own good (Henry Mancini's award-winning 'Moon River' being symptomatic); but taken as a shallow fairytale it has a certain charm.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Adapted from a play by Dejan Dukovski, Paskaljevic's freewheeling black comedy charts an eventful night in the life of various inhabitants of Belgrade following the break-up of Yugoslavia. As their paths intersect and intertwine, the Serbian writer/director explores, somewhat insistently, his fellow citizens' almost absurd and very dangerous tendency to argue, fall out, fight, hate, maim and mutilate, and make up again over a sentimental laugh. Much more tightly controlled than the work of his (reputedly detested) compatriot Kusturica, but occasionally painted in similarly broad, exuberant strokes, this is a sometimes scary, sometimes hilarious, consistently compassionate portrait of a culture in crisis.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Unlike other Hollywood virtuosos, De Palma's central inspiration remains unashamedly the horror film and its thundering techniques of emotional manipulation. <i>Carrie </i>is almost an amalgamation of <i>The Exorcist</i> and <i>American Graffiti</i>, with Spacek as a religious maniac's daughter whose experience of puberty is so harrowing that it develops paranormal aspects. De Palma's ability to combine the romantic and the horrific has never been so pulverising. Here he contrives a wild juxtaposition of Carrie's freakish inner turmoil with the dreamy cruisin' mentality of her high-school colleagues. The style and imagery are strictly primary in the Freudian sense: menstrual blood and spotless ball dresses, Cinderella dressed up for the abattoir. But the fierce sympathy it extends to its unfashionable central character puts the film a million miles above the contemporary line in sick exploitation.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Never did Cavalcanti's misspent avant-garde youth fuse more fascinatingly with his mature flair for melodrama than in this entrancingly flamboyant celebration of the English music hall. Trinder's slyly innocent rendering of 'Everything will be lovely when the pigs begin to fly' is interrupted by a riot and a pair of bizarre female jugglers, Holloway's Great Vance has a luminous vitality which verges on the surreal, and Warren's larger-than-life Bessie Bellwood subversively drowns aristocratic disdain in a sea of sensuous vulgarity. The atmosphere of cosy communality that permeates the film leaves little room for the grim poverty which surrounded the real music halls, but Cavalcanti happily sacrifices realism to create a monument to popular culture.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
The last half-hour of Aardman's first feature is pretty much all one might expect. But as far as laughs go, it's slow to take off; and in terms of gags, characters and narrative, it lacks the freshness of some of the earlier films. This is <i>The Great Escape</i> with chickens, and herein lie the limitations. First, the fowl are neither as funny nor as well characterised as Gromit and Co. Furthermore, directors Park and Lord are so keen to get the PoW format pat that the film comes across as pastiche not parody. As Ginger tries to persuade Rocky, a Rhode Island Red, to help her fellow egg-layers escape from Tweedy's Farm (where a barbaric pie machine is being built) familiarity with the stereotypes may produce pleasure of recognition, but not consistent laughter. Still, it'd be churlish to carp about this triumph of craftsmanlike technique.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An everyday story of Mafia folk, incorporating a severed horse's head in the bed and a number of heartwarming family occasions, as well as pointers on how not to behave in your local trattoria (i.e. blasting the brains of your co-diners out all over their fettuccini). Mario Puzo's novel was brought to the screen in bravura style by Coppola, who was here trying out for the first time that piano/fortissimo style of crosscutting between religious ritual and bloody machine-gun massacre that was later to resurface in a watered-down version in <i>The Cotton Club</i>. See Brando with a mouthful of orange peel. Watch Pacino's cheek muscles twitch in incipiently psychotic fashion. Trace his rise from white sheep of the family to budding don and fully-fledged bad guy. Singalong to Nino Rota's irritatingly catchy theme tune. Its soap operatics should never have been presented separately from Part II.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The French were so dismayed by Stanley Kubricks sober portrait of sinister, high-level manoeuvres behind the lines of the World War I trenches that they banned his third feature from their screens for many years. Certainly the direct accusation here  lifted from Humphrey Cobbs source novel  is that the pompous, twisted and fictional French commander General Paul Mireau (George Macready) possesses not an ounce of sympathy for his embattled troops (There is no such thing as shell-shock!). He wilfully orders a suicidal mission that he knows will fail and, when it does, perversely decides that three soldiers  picked arbitrarily  must face a military court and, if found guilty, execution. <br />Whats so startling  and impressive  about Kubricks storytelling is the cold, matter-of-fact manner with which the film unfolds. Mireau is suitably grotesque but never a c aricature; the three accused men react naturally (one is a simpering coward) and elicit only natural  not heroic  sympathy; and Kubrick employs his camera with rational, military precision, especially during a superbly shot court sequence in which he applies equal coverage to each man on trial. The result is that our dismay and anger become directed at war itself, not individuals. Ultimately, despite the limp rendition of the Marseillaise at the films opening, its not the French but all military that come off badly here.<br />The films  and Kubricks  conscience is Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax, an idealist and troublemaker caught between his men and his superiors. Douglas performance is enthralling, but perhaps the films only bum note is Daxs  later emergence as a hero in the face of everyone else, both guilty and innocent. Still, the final scene, in which Kubrick presents close-ups of soldiers watching a captured German girl being forced to sing for their pleasure is nothing short of masterful.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A wicked black comedy about teenage suicide and pernicious peer-group pressure, this refreshing parody of high-school movies is venomously penned by Daniel Waters and sharply directed by Lehmann. The Heathers are three vacuous Westerburg High school beauties who specialise in 'being popular' and making life hell for socially inadequate dweebettes and pillowcases. Having sold out her former friends in these categories, Veronica (Ryder) becomes an honorary member of the select clique - but turns monocled mutineer. Aided by handsome rebellious newcomer JD (Slater), she devises a drastic plan to undermine the teen-queen tyranny, but underestimates JD's ruthlessness: the scheme backfirs dangerously. The compromised ending (forced on the film-makers by New World) is a serious let-down, but there is some exceptional ensemble acting, several stylish set pieces, and more imaginative slang than you could shake a cheerleader's ass at. More crucially, the film uses an intimate knowledge of teen-movie clichs to subvert their debased values from the <i>inside</i>.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A multinational production, set in Ireland, written and directed by a Serb, based on an ancient Chinese folk tale - this has more edge than the usual blarney. 'A man is measured by his enemies,' avows Harry (Meaney in expansive mode): so he picks on George (Dunbar), the most successful and beloved man in the village. Caught up in this one-way feud is Harry's gormless son Gus (Murphy), who has his heart set on marrying George's latest girl, a catch so precious even Harry agrees to trade half a field of cabbages for her. The union only quickens Harry's descent into paranoia, with disastrous results for most of the characters. Hard not to read this earthy black comedy as an allegory for civil war. Certainly it's propelled by a strain of Balkan madness, a belief that extreme conviction is its own rationale. That fits Ireland in the 1920s well enough. Like poteen, it's unsubtle but potent.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of three films Lean made virtually as star vehicles for his wife Ann Todd. Here she manages to extend the range of her semi-hysterical screen personality into a flimsily forceful character who pits her amoral deviousness against the rigid hypocrisy of Victorian Glasgow. Lean strongly emphasises her vulnerability: her French lover (Desny) is a preening bully, her father (Banks) a fire-eating patriarch, and her passage to the courtroom (accused of poisoning the lover) is marked by the furious rantings of a male mob. Where the film is remarkable, though, is in never allowing her to become simply a victim. She dares to expose and enjoy her sensuality, and cunningly exploits the prim reticence expected of a Victorian miss to avoid submission to marriage, deflecting the hostile gaze of outraged society with a proudly enigmatic vanity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This Euro pudding film, made by a Belgrade-born director, finds a corner of low-rent New York that is forever the Old Country. In the backyard of Brooklyn's Paradiso bar, the blind mother of the Spanish owner, Alonso, draws water each morning from a well and milks the goat. When the family of Montenegran odd-job man Bayo eventually gains illegal entry to the US, his mum isn't so immediately at home, but ne'er-do-well eldest boy Luka gets right into the enterprise spirit and starts creating a future everyone can build on. This sentimental, deeply unpersuasive look at the immigrant's lot, dies virtually the minute Conti ambles on as Alonso, reprising his caricature Greek fisherman from <i>Shirley Valentine</i>. Almost as bad is the Brooklyn backdrop rigged up in a Hamburg studio, which resembles nothing so much as a set for <i>Sesame Street</i>.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Dont worry if you havent seen Oshiis first Ghost in the Shell anime of 1995 (I havent); indeed, dont worry if youre not an anime or manga buff (Im certainly not). Theres still stuff here to blow your mind, stir your soul or do something nice to whatever makes you you. And dont get upset that its near-impossible to follow in any real detail the tortuous Blade Runner-style story about a couple of cops investigating a series of murders committed by androids. Nor, Id advise, need you take too seriously all the philosophical musings and quotations of the sc-fi/noir characters. Just see the film on the biggest screen you can find, and immerse yourself in Hong Kong, 2032. That said, as agent Batou  extensively modified anatomically so that only his brain and memories remain distinctively human, making him a cyborg  and his partner Togusa journey into an infernal realm where realitys constantly open to question, the film does throw up intriguing issues about identity and existence: what exactly defines our humanity, and is that necessarily more important than anything else with regard to ethics, the value of life or the future of the world? Besides, the main pleasure provided by Oshiis film are the extraordinary images created by a blend of CGI and 2D animation techniques. The elegance, attention to detail, the invention and expertise all ensure that the movies never less than visually breathtaking, the monumental sense of scale (especially during a festival scene) beautifully balanced by intimate characterisations  most notably in the improbably instance of a wonderfully endearing basset hound.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Screenwriter Jim Sheridan follows <i>My Left Foot</i> and <i>The Field</i> with a soppy tale of life among the Travellers. In his Dublin tower block, a broken man since the death of his wife, one time Traveller king Papa Riley (Byrne) is swayed from his determination to give his sons (Conroy and Fitzgerald) a conventional home when Grandpa Ward (Kelly) returns from his travels, bringing fanciful tales and a white horse which is lodged in the cramped flat. The authorities take a predictably dim view of this, but in confiscating the horse, provide both father and sons with a new lease of life. But the film lapses into tired whimsy when the boys masquerade as lawless cowboys. It's hard to share their vision of the west of Ireland as America's Western frontier, and impossible to perceive any danger from the uniformed incompetents in pursuit.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Shot back-to-back with <i>The Outsiders</i>, similarly based on a novel by SE Hinton, and signalled by Coppola as 'Camus for kids', <i>Rumble Fish </i>does indeed have a hero figure (Rourke) who belongs to a former age of existential 'outsiders', coasting through the world in an insulated state of deafness and colour blindness from too many rumbles. His kid brother (Dillon) idolises him, but is too stupid to see the damage done to all concerned by the continuous gang-fights of frightful violence but no importance. All of which is all very well; but Coppola's recent viewing seems to have been German silent films of the '20s, so he has decided to coat the whole enterprise in a startling Expressionist style, which is very arresting but hardly appropriate to the matter in hand. As with <i>The Outsiders'</i> it's very hard to picture the audience at which the film is aimed. CPea.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Lousy as it is, Warner Bros' big budget version of the cult '60s TV series isn't any worse than, say, the last two <i>Batman</i> flicks. Charm is a difficult quality to duplicate, and while Fiennes makes a passable stab at debonair, Uma Thurman's notion of insouciance translates as smug and spacey; she's far more convincing as Mrs Peel's deadly mute double, a robot, presumably (like so much of the plot, that remains a matter of conjecture). In some ways, the movie's inadequacies are inextricable from its virtues: heavy cuts have made a mockery of any sense of continuity, but then <i>The Avenger</i>s always peddled surreal and absurdist conceits, so artificiality is the name of the game (there are a few neat ideas here: a conference in teddy bear suits, a stairway out of Escher, and an invisible cameo by Patrick Macnee). Its ersatz Englishness makes a certain sense. The trouble is, the film's decadence isn't a put-on, it is, simply, depressingly, degeneratively, decadent.]]></review>

Barry Hines' novel, about a young schoolboy in Barnsley who attempts to escape the tedium and meaninglessness of his uninviting working-class future by caring for and training a kestrel that he finds, is never allowed to fall into undue sentimentality by Loach's low-key direction (his first feature). Rather than a tale of a boy and his pet, the film is a lucid and moving examination of the narrow options open to people without money, family stability and support, or education. Terrific performances, illuminated by Chris Menges' naturalistic but often evocative photography.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Lucas' first film, a reworking of <i>1984</i> set in a computer-controlled future world where THX 1138 (Duvall) becomes an outlaw hounded by android police after rediscovering love, long banned in this drug-soothed Garden of Eden where children are created by test-tube. Overall the film is a little hazy, and inclined to fall back on familiar messages about humanity and inhumanity after what one presumes was the nuclear fall. But visually it is often extraordinary, with Lucas playing on perspectives and dislocations throughout, nowhere more brilliantly than in the 'prison' represented by a limbo of whiteness that seems to stretch as far as the eye can see. White-clad against this whiteness, human figures disappear except for their hands and faces, others mysteriously appear out of the blinding glare of nothingness, and one can readily believe in this infinity through which THX 1138 must journey endlessly if he is to escape. Some nice touches of humour, too.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[On paper, it could be just another
throwaway chick-flick: two very different sisters  one an uptight lawyer, the
other a boozy tart  wrestle with life, love and their relationship with each other. But with
the director of LA Confidential at the helm and a solid source novel at its
core (Jennifer Weiners bestseller), this achieves a level of sophistication
rarely seen in the genre. Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Caf
strikes one as one of the more recent mainstream examples, and that was 14
years ago. But this is less worthy, packing in dark humour and decidedly flawed
characters alongside the expected moral conclusions.<br />Maggie (Cameron Diaz)
is not only a flirt, but a thief and a liar. Tracking down her estranged
grandmother (Shirley MacLaine), she discovers a world of wizened wisecrackers 
not to mention amiable elderly men giving her the once over. Life doesnt end
when you get older is the message: in fact, the film implies, your
communication skills improve. Female communication is one of the films
enduring themes, and although some lines verge on the trite, theyre given
impact by convincing characters. Toni Collette is particularly able as lawyer
Rose, a toned-down, smarter version of the Bridget Jones role she once
rejected. Broad physical comedy and a high truism count mean not everyone will
love this  those who cant stomach Sex and the City (referenced here) should
approach with caution. But considering it doesnt star Maggie Smith or Judi
Dench, its surprising how mature and moving this female-focused drama is.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[There can be no doubt of the fact that Kim Longinotto is one of the finest filmmakers working in the UK today, and this film (which comes hot on the heels of last year's outstanding 'Sisters in Law') certainly gives credence to the notion. Training her camera on the staff and pupils of Oxford's Mullbury Bush School for children with acute behavioural problems, she manages to tease out a disturbing, deeply moving and even at times, darkly comic portrait of an institution which is seen as a last chance saloon for its many troubled pupils. Avoiding sensationalism by tastefully editing out scenes of violence and dispensing with the forced narrative arc which seems de rigeur in most documentary films these days, Longinotto's gentle struggle to inject objectivity into the form means that the viewer is (for once) allowed to read the material as they wish. A very strong piece of work.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>This new entertaining and educational IMAX offering from National Geographic delves into the Cretaceous world of marine reptiles and fish  and its a pretty fascinating trip. For instance, did you know that Kansas was once submerged beneath a sea roughly the size of the Med? The experts know this because of the thousands of marine fossils that have been unearthed in the area.</p><p>Director Sean Phillips and the production team have made a fine fist of illustrating the lives of these bizarre creatures via some highly realistic three-dimensional CGI imagery, most of it centred on the main players of the time, namely the cute dolphin-like Dolichorhynchops and its most feared predator, the giant, heavily toothed Tylosaurus (and you thought the great white was scary). The film then cuts to the sight of paleontologists unearthing yet another fossilised time-capsule before were taken beneath the waves again to see what the creature might have looked like in its natural habitat. Liev Schreiber provides the informative, scholarly narrative and Peter Gabriel lays on parts of the simmering soundtrack. A good effort all round.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For better or worse, its an extraordinary piece of British pop history: former RAF radar boffin Joe Meek installs himself above a bag shop (now a kebab house) on Holloway Road, where he crafts 1962s landmark Telstar, a slice of 45rpm perfection which was the first British single to top the US charts. Meeks career didnt hit the heights for long, however, as musical fashion moved on while his amphetamine consumption, interest in the occult and troubled gay sexuality addled his decision-making process, setting the scene for a tragic finale. Overall, were indebted to Nick Morans film for putting the Joe Meek story, in all its gumption and strangeness, back in the spotlight, yet the utterly unruly trajectory of Meeks personal and professional career makes it an awkward customer on celluloid.<br />The film is at its best when Con ONeills full-on Meek has an ensemble to act against in recreating the larky glitter of Britains formative pop years. Thats partly thanks to jaunty support from James Corden and Ralf Little as musicians, and JJ Feild is spot-on as talent-free singing sensation Heinz Burt while plummy Kevin Spacey is a good sport as Meeks backer, Major Banks. However, as the tone darkens and ONeills left carrying the story on his own, its less compelling, exposing the fact that the script never really gets inside Meeks head to allow us to experience the downward slide with him  instead of observing it with increasingly academic interest. Even if Telstar cant quite get the measure of its fascinating material, its pluck and ambition prove infectious enough to outweigh its flaws.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its one of the oddest birds on the planet and one of the most beautiful, but is the flamingo worth devoting a feature to? Disney always needed to up the ante if its new wildlife label, Disneynature, was to compete with big nature-doc players like the BBC, National Geographic and Animal Planet. That its pulled it off so well is testament to the skills of the production team because, in the pantheon of wildlife docs, this ones a corker: the cinematography is exquisite; its admirably devoid of any overt anthropomorphism; the narration, while a little too mythical in context, is informative; the music is perfect; and, for a Disney-branded film, its surprisingly willing to face up to the more grisly side of life in the wild.<br />The film opens with a breathtaking scene of lesser flamingos en route to their breeding ground at Tanzanias Lake Natron, an inhospitably salty body of water just inches deep. During the dry season its a salt flat, but after the rains a nourishing red algae forms along with islands of crusty salt, affording the birds a safe area to nest and nurture their cute, ungainly offspring. At least until the dreaded malibu storks turn up for the easy pickings<br />Special honours to the Cinematic Orchestra for its quirky score and, of course, to the pin-sharp photography. On the negative side, it takes a while to adjust to Mariella Frostrups throaty voiceover and the film wanes near the end. But as a first Disney wildlife foray, this is very grown-up.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[On the evidence of both this and the new film from Cristi Puiu (The Death of Mr Lazarescu), whose Aurora plays in next months London Film Festival, the much-heralded Romanian new wave continues to produce some of Europes most challenging and experimental work  and rarely without humour. This second film from Corneliu Porumboiu (12:08 East of Bucharest) is a gloomy, realist piece on the surface but the driest of black comedy emerges as it goes on, building to a climactic scene that feels like the solving of a tough (and sometimes hard-going) literary riddle.<br />Cristi (Dragos Bucur), a small-town junior detective, is ordered to trail three schoolkids and investigate their pot smoking, even though he insists the kids are doing little wrong. This assignment is obviously a grand waste of Cristis time (and ours, as we watch him for minutes on end wandering round streets and hanging on street corners). Told in long, testingly protracted takes, punctuated by amusing bursts of chat between Cristi and his wife (about the meaning of pop lyrics) or Cristi and his colleagues (about the meaning of conscience), the film is an upending of the <i>policier </i>genre and a play on the misuse and tyranny of words, which, in the context of the police force on show, suggests a continuing horror of bureaucracy. Necessarily infuriating but finally very rewarding.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When in hell, more like Just when you thought the idea of basing a major plot point on a handful of magic coins wouldve been deemed too ludicrous even for Hollywood, along comes When in Rome and drags us right back to zero. Kristin Bell (Sarah from Forgetting Sarah Marshall) is the sassy, whip-smart gallery curator over in the Italian capital for her younger sisters wedding. As with Sandra Bullock in The Proposal, its taken as read that she cant have a job and a boyfriend at the same time, and so she begins to worry when she becomes an object of desire for five self-obsessed dimwits, the result of said magic coins which are drunkenly swiped from a fountain. You get the sense that had this been stripped of all its magical realist idiocy, there might have been a sweet, throwaway romcom in there somewhere. As it stands, youre just left to ponder how the hell this mirthless garbage got the green light.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The doors of perception are further cleansed in director Tom DiCillos tribute to
the Doors, fronted by the late Jim Morrison. Yet nothing appears
particularly infinite: DiCillo adeptly skewered Indiewood in the
moviemaking satire <i>Living in Oblivion</i> (1995), but his
documentary skills are rudimentary and crude, shaped mostly by his
shallow fandom for the group. The worst dialogue of the year so far
comes from Johnny Depps smarmy narration track: But you cant burn
out, he says of Morrison, if you were never on fire. Stop the
presses, Bill Blake!</p><p>Of course, such pseudo-profundity suits the
Doors. Taken out of context, those lines about lizard kings and monks
buying lunch seem even more like masturbatory grabs at enlightenment;
the bands genius came from the ways Morrison, Ray Manzarek, Robby
Krieger and John Densmore enveloped the words within their own
inimitable sound. They reflected the zeitgeist even as they reached
beyond it. </p><p>The doc is good for illuminating some of the groups
methods (the lack of a bass player was a liberating bit of
happenstance), as well as for showcasing a wide swath of previously
unseen footage from concerts and recording sessions. Morrison
inevitably takes center stage, since his drug-addled personahalf
shaman, half sex addictis the easiest to view with uncritical awe.
Like so many Doors chroniclers, DiCillo cant help but fall under the
singers spell; its understandable, but frustrating.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This likeable but scrappy debut won the Michael Powell award for the Best British Film at Edinburgh last week, which suggests that the competition wasnt so hot. A leftfield comedy of the mundane with a sci-fi edge, Skeletons doesnt quite know what to do with its bold ideas. It begins with some agreeable, sub-Merchant-and-Gervais banter between Davis (Ed Gaughan) and Bennett (Andrew Buckley), the Little and Large of the world of extraction  a process by which this pair investigate homes in middle England to uncover the truth about their past. Together, they work for The Colonel (Jason Isaacs, channelling Dads Army), who reminds them not to get too close to their clients. Comedy segues into stranger territory when a case challenges this code: Jane (Paprika Steen) last saw her husband eight years ago and wants to know what happened to him. Various fantasy strands lead to revelations about several characters, but its hard to take this late plea for sincerity seriously.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[You wonder what it must have been like to be 20 or 30 and to watch Godards Breathless in 1960? Many, whatever their age, must have loathed the arrogant energy, recklessness and sheer, cocky youth of this pulpy tale of a fast-talking, chain-smoking, big-lipped wideboy (Jean-Paul Belmondo) on the run in Paris with a crop-haired American wannabe journalist (Jean Seberg) who sells copies of the <i>Herald Tribune</i> on the Champs-lyses, wears gorgeous dresses, talks happily about her many lovers and has a sculpture of empty Lucky Strike packets spelling out<i> Pourquoi? </i>on the wall of her tiny flat. Whats not to love, you think? Whats not to <i>hate</i>, many surely felt?<br />Fifty years later, Breathless hasnt entered its dotage yet: it remains a film whose know-it-all front you want to sneer at as much as you want to sigh at Seberg and Belmondos style and run along with their sexually frank chat and epigrams about life and love. That Breathless still comes across as modern and confrontational is a sign of how much its been copied and how radical it was for a young French filmmaker to pour plaster containing his peculiar concerns about cinema, morality, romance and much else into the tatty mould of the Hollywood gangster B-movie.<br /><br />There are times when it feels like Godards first film is designed to be loathed. Look carefully and youll spot Godard himself, 28 at the time and already an iconoclastic critic for Cahiers du Cinma. Hes the guy in the suit we see snitching on murderous anti-hero Michel Poiccard, pointing him out to the police while pretending to read the paper outside the offices of <i>France Soir.</i> What a rat. But thats Godard all over. Hes always been an uningratiating, utterly wilful filmmaker  an artist who invites us into his world and never the other way round.<br /><br />To watch Breathless, a film by a young cinephile hopped up on movies and ideas of what they should be, is to walk into the bedroom of the coolest student in town and discover a giant pinboard of loves, hates, inspirations and thoughts, all moving at 24 frames per second. However, Godard makes the whole thing feel uncommonly speedy and disjointed by employing a frenetic package of stylistic tics: his actors walking and talking; his cinematographer Raoul Coutards handheld location shooting; Martial Solals ceaseless jazz score that moves and changes direction so fast it almost trips over itself; and his editors jump cuts, which were radical at the time but so common now that we barely notice them. <br />If youve never seen Breathless, see it now  but dont expect an easy ride. If you havent seen it for ages, see it again and be surprised at the fresh reactions it provokes. Afterwards, you can talk about modernism, you can talk about Godards dismissal of the <i>cinma de papa</i>, you can talk about the documentary flavour of the whole thing mixed with the corny template of the cheap noir But theres one element that its hard to deconstruct or sound intelligent about  the fact that its so damn cool.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The producers of Crimefighters must have been mortified when Kick-Ass hove into view: a big-budget behemoth riffing on exactly the themes of superheroism, vigilantism and social justice that fuel this ambitious DIY gem. Theres a crimewave on the mean streets of York, forcing three hipster chums to don masks and take a stand. It doesnt hurt that one of them knows karate, one owns a costume shop and one really, really needs to get laid. <br />Crimefighters bears all the hallmarks of a homemade production: cramped locations, crudely orchestrated action and performers who mistake enthusiasm for ability. But what it lacks in art it more than makes up for in heart: this is an enormously likeable film, part love letter to a great but under-filmed city (one character wears a self-altered T-shirt reading I heart Y), part shambolic, wonderfully unpredictable rom-com and part haphazard meditation on crime and punishment, culminating in a series of climactic revelations which are smart, surprising and genuinely funny.

      <review><![CDATA[Its occasional dramatic longueurs notwithstanding, Chahine's film about the 12th century Moorish philosopher Averros is a brave, engrossing attack on Islamic fundamentalist dogma and oppression. Averros and his followers are shown as free-thinking liberals, the Caliph (who ordered his work burnt) a mere political pawn, but secondary to the narrative itself is the glorious, stirring (and generically traditional) use of song and dance - frowned on by the philosopher's enemies - as an energising, liberating force which embodies Chahine's notion that 'thought has wings'. Common sense and sensuality merge in the intelligent script and vibrant, colourful mise en scne to often exhilarating effect.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Winner of the Audience Award at this years Sundance, John Carneys poignant, modern-day love story set on the streets of Dublin offers a brooding alternative to the traditional conventions of the musical. Starring musicians, Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov, as the unnamed leads, the film centres on their unlikely relationship when the Girl (Irglov), an immigrant pianist, helps the Guy (Hansard), a street busker, to make a demo to take to London. Attracted by their mutual adoration for music, a hesitant but empathetic relationship swiftly develops as they come to terms with past loves through the delicately veiled metaphors of lyrics that are subtly woven into the narrative. The performances unfold in music shops, buses, recording studios and late-night apartments, where Carney settles in for long, intimate shots of the pair, whose songs articulate more about the characters than any monologue could. Too shrewd for idealistic closure, the films stiff dose of postmodern angst thwarts numerous, romanticised perceptions of love, sex and conjugal possibility; besides, the Guys too old for the Girl and still infatuated with his ex, and she has a child and an estranged husband back in the Czech Republic.</p><p>Shot on DV, Carneys highly charged, urban mise-en-scne with its blinking street lamps, vacant shops and dishevelled bed-sits provides ample poetic backdrop for the films lengthy tracking shots, epitomised in a sequence where the Girl walks to the corner shop in pyjamas and slippers while listening to one of the Guys songs on her personal stereo. With outstanding performances from Hansard and new-comer Irglov, Carney has created a sublime, visual album of unassuming and self-assured eloquence.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[As dazzling feats of narrative acrobatics go, this ingeniously self-reflexive second feature from maverick writer-director Miguel Gomes stands in a league of its own. It opens as a warm, gently freewheeling documentary on the cultural pastimes of rural Portugal that zeroes in on the touring duties of various MOR folk bands. Rambling anecdotes and shots of glowing pastoral vistas are splintered with fictionalised vignettes that observe the films dithering crew at work. <br />The natural response to the material is that it exists simply to offer a sincere and splendidly poetic chronicle of the rustic textures of Portuguese life, until just over the mid-point when  out of the blue  the close-knit members of one particular band usher the film from reality into fiction, and a brooding family drama plays out across the landscape weve just been introduced to. Recalling the provocative docu-fictions of Abbas Kiarostami and Jia Zhangke, Our Beloved Month of August offers meta-textual manna for adventurous cinemagoers while remaining exhilaratingly true to its sunny, provincial roots.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The Toy Story films are deservedly seen as the gold standard for computer-generated animation, putting their gorgeously detailed digital craftsmanship at the service of a pleasingly simple fantasy set-up, warm, complex characterisation and classically elegant storytelling. But, like the best childrens stories, theyre also about something seriously scary: the separation anxiety with which all kids (and plenty of adults) are familiar and the spectre of its extreme extrapolation, total abandonment. It doesnt take a sociologist to work out why such themes might strike a chord at a time when family life is so fragile for so many; the Toy Story cycle broaches the subject with an emotional honesty that allows young viewers to exercise those anxieties in safety  even if it stops short of the kind of traumatic wallop associated with, say, Bambis mum.<br />This third outing finds the gang  Woody the cowboy (voiced by Tom Hanks), space ranger Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack), timid dinosaur Rex (Wallace Shawn) and various other dog, pig and potato-based playthings  facing the reality of their long-indifferent owner leaving for college. The toys fear indefinite leave in the attic or  worse  the trash; the middle ground is relocation to Sunnyside, a day-care centre where, perhaps, they can serve new owners. All seems well on their arrival  sweet kids, welcoming new toys  but jeopardy is, of course, around the corner.<br />The film is in 3D but, hang-gliding escapades notwithstanding, in-your-face effects take a back seat to more subtle applications, such as environmental immersion, mock-heroic playfulness and suspenseful contrasts of scale. That said, the opening adventure sequence is an assured stereo set piece and the short preceding the main feature, Day &amp; Night, a high-concept gem.<br />There are several elements in Toy Story 3 that echo its predecessors: the outside-world escape plot, the reversion of Buzz to factory-setting-level naivety, the trustworthiness of new pals. But there are also many witty novelties, from a when-Barbie-met-Ken subplot to a 2D makeover for Mr Potato Head and gags about toys as Method actors. This is also a film willing to flirt with darker matter, including mortal jeopardy at a landfill, freaky clown, monkey and baby toys and a flashback in which a toy feels abandoned. Emotional responsibility is mutable in the toy-owner dynamic: at some points the toy feels like the owners vulnerable child, at others like its diligent parent. Either role, these reassuring movies recognise at their darkest moments, can yield the kind of despair that prompts one character to growl: Were all just trash waiting to be thrown away.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Why, in the 1870s, would a Parisienne (Audran), an acclaimed chef, be working for a pittance for two elderly sisters supervising a remote religious community on Denmark's windswept Jutland coast? The unlikely answer to that question may be found in Axel's superb adaptation of Isak Dinesen's very funny short story, a bizarre, magical concoction, seasoned to literally mouthwatering effect. The ingredients are marvellous locations, crisp photography, and an excellent cast. Axel never overstates the opposition between the villagers' God-fearing asceticism and Babette's feats of gastronomic wizardry, preferring instead a gently comic portrait of lives defined by pious austerity. It's a tale of self-sacrifice, thwarted ambitions, and lost love, but sheer sensuous joy suffuses the screen when Babette performs her own special miracle for one last supper. Axel, too, is surely an alchemist; compared to most literary adaptations, this is the word made flesh.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Shirley Clarke's third feature is almost as straightforward as its title. It picks up the passionate interest in ghetto subcultures that Clarke established in <i>The Connection</i> and <i>The Cool World</i>, but this time without feeling any need to create a fiction: <i>Portrait of Jason</i> is simply a two-hour conversation with a middle-aged, black, homosexual prostitute. The new simplicity of approach reflects the enormous influence of Andy Warhol on independent film-making in the '60s: a new trust in basic film-making techniques, and a new distrust of 'artifice' like editing. Jason himself certainly provides enough artifice to keep any audience engrossed: his colourful, self-mocking account of his life reveals a great deal about the situation of a ghetto boy with 'white-boy fever'. The moral catch is that by fulfilling Jason's dreams of himself as a 'performer', the movie deliberately pushes him out of his own control...]]></review>

A crescendo of near-miss car smashes, horrible discoveries in the caravan, and out-of-order telephones, convinces the quartet that the whole state's bent; by which time we think so too, and dread the outcome. A wittily efficient quickie, the film is a winner all the way - a surprise, since Starrett's career thus far had been the movie director's equivalent of a criminal record. But it was scripted by Lee Frost and Wes Bishop, who produced another jolly horror, <i>The Thing With Two Heads</i> and who started classically by making sex films in a garage.]]></review>

Being a member of a perpetually outclassed basketball team isn't all Michael J Fox has to contend with: full moon turns him into a werewolf just like his dad. This amiable entry in the rarely popular wolfman genre wears its horror lightly, preferring the comic possibilities of the high school sporting 'n' dating movie. Apart from one not very ambitious transformation, the budget requires other boy-wolf-boy switches to happen off-screen. Popular enough for a sequel and an animated TV series, but the mostly unknown cast and crew stayed that way.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
Shot and edited with Denis' customary expertise, but disappointing for both its (admittedly ambitious) script and its performances, this is rather too elliptical and enigmatic for its own good. It tells of two individuals consumed by cannibalistic bloodlust, but cared for by loved ones: Dalle, who keeps breaking out of the house in which disenchanted boffin Descas keeps her locked up; and Gallo, honeymooning with Vessey in Paris in the hope that he may make contact with Descas (or should that be Dalle?). Do the killers thirst for blood because they're victims of medical experiments, or are the experiments carried out to cure such impulses? Who knows or even, given Gallo and Dalle's hollow performances, cares. The murders are nasty, the play with genre tradition uneasy, and certain scenes (Descas wandering cool as a cucumber into a blazing house) laughably implausible.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This definitive portrait of rocks most fascinating and elusive outsider has pretty much everything you could possibly want from a music doc. For a start it has a story to tell, charting the progress of flop teen-idol Scotty Engel, who left America for 60s Britain, hit big with the swoonsome boy-band pop of The Walker Brothers, then launched into a series of solo albums blending his baritonal MOR croon with seedy Jacques Brel imagery. As the records got further out, sales declined, and Scott Walker seemed destined to slope out of the spotlight. . . were it not for the fact that we now find him in the studio making a new album leaving conventional pop structures way behind in its avant-garde wake. Theres a song about the hanging of Mussolini, for instance, which requires a slab of meat to be punched for the mics. . .<br />Its an inspiring tale about an artist pursuing his own furrow whatever the cost, and respect oozes from contributors including David Bowie, Damon Albarn and the ever-urbane Jarvis Cocker. Given his reputation for reclusiveness (its rumoured he once crashed his car to avoid a gig), Walker himself proves a refreshingly straightforward interviewee, thankfully a lot less pretentious than some of his work. Indeed, with its careful assemblage of archive material, the film leaves us with a vivid picture of his unique career trajectory, and if it doesnt quite persuade us that the later materials as interesting to listen to as it is to talk about, the clever use of animated interludes means the music could hardly be given better presentation. An unhesitating recommendation for fans and neophytes alike.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This twee, Rohmer-lite French comedy about the brotherly rapport between a lofty but affable bourgeois painter (Daniel Auteuil) and a salt-of-the-earth gardener (Jean-Pierre Darroussin) is slight but very pleasant to sit through. Adapted from a memoir by artist Henri Cueco and directed with tasteful economy by Jean (son of Jacques) Becker, its a predictable tale where bonhomie develops into companionship and life lessons are duly passed across the social divide. <br />However, it does conform rigidly to preconceptions of the French middle-classes as intellectual, wine-swilling gadabouts whose anxieties about love and art amount to very little in comparison to the struggles of their cloth-capped, working-class brethren whose daily toil against repression and ailment will, if theyre lucky, result in some new tools or even a holiday to the seaside. As with all male-bonding films, theres also a mild homoerotic subtext which may remind viewers of the romantic exchanges shared between Ted and Ralph from the The Fast Show.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Given the effect the first Twilight film had on teens, its appropriate that the sequel is a study of sexual and romantic obsession. When pallid, principled vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) leaves town, his chaste girlfriend, Bella (Kristen Stewart), moons and mourns for months. The usual teen pursuits dont interest her: she sneers at shopping and only opts for sport or cinema if they bring her closer to Edward. Then solace arrives in the bulging biceps of Jacob (Taylor Lautner), Bellas childhood friend-turned-boy-hulk.<br />Its not exactly a celebration of female independence, but New Moon still has an expert handle on its young audience. Near-kisses and sexual frustration abound. Boys become attractive yet also dangerous when they come of age  and the good ones keep the monsters in check. This time, the monsters arent merely vampires, but werewolves: spectacular CG creatures that snarl and pounce their way through several enjoyable action sequences, then transform back into buff, topless young studs Yep, New Moon knows what its doing.<br />Plot-wise its a slow starter, but gains momentum when Bella develops a taste for adrenaline in the hope of catching a glimpse of her vampiric protector. Motorbike rides and deathly dives follow, along with a scenic race to Italy to meet uber-vampire Michael Sheen (always a pleasure). Welcome comedy comes from Bellas schoolmates, notably Jessica (Anna Kendrick), who wearily deconstructs the symbolism in zombie movies while bemoaning the lack of hot guys. Is this New Moon defending its fanbase and pre-empting criticism about its transparent agenda? Natalie and Bella are intelligent young women, yet ruled by their hormones  plenty of room for audience identification there. New Moon is little more than a skilful soap opera, but its still enjoyable escapism  even if youre old and wise enough to see through it.]]></review>

A 1960s-set wish-fulfillment romance, it sees sheltered teen Baby (Jennifer Grey) falling for hunky dancer Johnny (Patrick Swayze) on holiday when shes conveniently required to replace his dancing partner, whos pregnant (scandal!).<br /> 
Naturally, Babys parents would disapprove, so their illicit rehearsal sessions must be kept secret.
Some of the dialogue is clunky, incidental characters are stereotypical and the set-up is completely unlikely. But this is a fantasy, deftly tapping into the youthful desire to explore the delights of a forbidden world, shine beyond the expectations of parents and lose ones virginity to Patrick Swayze. OK, so this last point may be of less concern to todays teen audience but the films easy charm, infectious soundtrack and tidy choreography should still win over new fans as well as old.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ferris (Broderick) is a boy who gets anything he wants, screws over anyone who gets in his way, and gets patted on the back for doing so. Gathering his best friend (Ruck) and his best girlfriend (Sara), he skips school for the day out in Chicago. Hughes revels in Ferris' ingenuity, then neatly adds dimension after a ninety-minute parade of hubris and material wealth by telling us that people count more than their possessions. Ferris is an admittedly entertaining, at times delightful fellow. How unfortunate that no one got to wring the little bastard's neck.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The real progenitor of this musical celebrating the rock'n'roll '50s, had it not fudged some of the less adequate dance numbers by shooting above the knees, would be <i>West Side Story</i>. Otherwise, the film aspires to some of the pretensions of <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i>, from which it borrows liberally while saddled with the liabilities of its dumb stage musical script. Its flashy opportunism (nostalgia pitched squarely at an audience too young to even recall the era) quickly becomes very irritating. Allusions to french letters and high school pregnancies, and double entendres allowed by the hindsight of this more 'permissive' society, scarcely conceal the fact that <i>Grease</i> is even more simplistic (and finally reactionary) than the beach blanket movies of the era. Lots of colour, movement, surface glitter, only one decent song (the title track sung by Frankie Valli).]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A pretty superior teen angst movie, with John Hughes (executive-producing and scripting but not directing this time) completing the series he began with <i>Sixteen Candles</i> and <i>The Breakfast Club</i>. Being young, Hughes tells us, isn't easy. Red-haired Ringwald has no mother in sight, Harry Dean Stanton for a downbeat father, and an unfortunate high school rep. She wears odd clothes, tools round in a clapped-out Beetle, and works in a record store at weekends (cue Psychedelic Furs, The Smiths, etc). Still, she's got lots of spirit, and by the end even the Nice, Unbelievably Rich Kid with the BMW is beginning to recognise what we've known all along: that she's the best thing around. It's a plea on behalf of upward mobility, and - more remarkable - revolves around a single question: will Molly make it to the high school prom? To be able to give this kind of stuff new and sympathetic twists is a tribute to Hughes' skill with narrative, and to Ringwald's magnetism as a performer.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This definitive Brat Pack movie, a yuppie coming-of-age yarn, is co-written and directed by Joel Schumacher - all, perhaps, anyone really needs to know. But still, filling in the blanks, it's a portrait, drawn in crayon, of a group of friends in Washington, DC, recently graduated from college, but light years from maturity, struggling to cope with the fragilities of their relationships and the complexities of what MTV later termed The Real World. Estevez and Nelson are as unappealing here as in <i>The Breakfast Club</i>, though in fairness they're hampered by a script that seems to despise its characters. So, by the end, will you.]]></review>

In retrospect, this adaptation of John Braine's Bradford-set novel, with its moral melodramatics as Laurence Harvey cheats his way to success (a good marriage) via the death of his 'true love' and the bed of his mistress (Signoret), may not stand the test of time. But it remains intriguing as a sort of <i>Brief Encounter</i>, '50s-style.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In the wake of the huge commercial success of <i>Alien</i>, almost all attention has perversely focused on the provenance of the script (was it a rip-off of <i>It, the Terror from Beyond Space</i>? Of Van Vogt's fiction? Was former John Carpenter collaborator Dan O'Bannon sold out by producers Walter Hill and David Giler's rewrites?). But the limited strengths of its staple sci-fi horrors - crew of commercial spacecraft menaced by stowaway monster - always derived from either the offhand organic/ Freudian resonances of its design or the purely (brilliantly) manipulative editing and pacing of its above-average shock quota. Intimations of a big-budget <i>Dark Sta</i>r fade early, and notions of Weaver as a Hawksian woman rarely develop beyond her resourceful reaction to jeopardy. At least Scott has no time to dawdle over redundant futuristic effects in the fashion that scuttles his later <i>Blade Runner</i>.]]></review>

Fifty-seven years on, Ripley is discovered - Sleeping Beauty in space. Plagued by nightmares and surrounded by sceptics, she's forced to return to the resting place of the original alien's mother ship with a bunch of seen-it-all-before Marines. Confidently directed by James Cameron (heretofore known only for <i>The Terminator</i> and <i>Piranha II</i>), this sequel dares to build slowly, allowing Weaver to develop a multi-dimensional character even as it ups the ante by fetishising the Marines' hi-tech hardware and spawning legions of aliens (the suspense involves guessing which group will be cannon fodder). There is always an interesting tension in Cameron's work between masculine and feminine qualities. When it finally hits the fan here, we're in for the mother of all battles.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Two young American hitch-hikers sample British hospitality on the Yorkshire moors (temporary shelter is proffered at The Slaughtered Lamb pub), only to be savagely attacked. Naughton recuperates in London, marvelling at the best the NHS can provide in the form of nurse Agutter, but his deceased and decomposing pal Dunne keeps popping back to clue him up on what's in store come the full moon. The mix of horror and humour felt very fresh back in 1981, and many people retain affection for this sly, witty movie - most memorable for the trashing of Piccadilly Circus. In the cold light of day, it must be admitted that Landis leans too heavily on the shock effects provided by Rick Baker's lycanthropic transformation make-up.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The first long shot of Howls castle, moving through the fog of an Alpine pasture, is a doozy: its bullfrog-battleship bulk huffing and chunting along on a set of sure-clawed chicken-legs, its the sort of organic-hydraulic hybrid at which Miyazaki excels. The innards prove less impressive, especially for anyone imagining a bustling citadel to rival the divine bath-house of Spirited Away; with activity largely restricted to a kitchen-living room, it feels more like Howls moving bedsit. Still, its an apt symbol for a film whose copious initial charm diminishes on closer acquaintance.  Freely adapted from Diana Wynne Jones novel, Howls Moving Castle is the story of Sophie, a hard-working, self-effacing teenager who takes refuge with the wizard Howl after being transformed into a crone by the Witch of the Waste (a well-coutured whale of a woman voiced by Lauren Bacall). Supposedly fearsome, Howl turns out to be  a drama queen with a yellow streak  albeit a rather dashing one, in an androgynous, Manga sort of way. Meanwhile mobilisation is underway for a total war in which magic is merely another WMD.  The set-up offers plenty of dazzle, from the milieu  an exquisitely rendered high imperial/pastoral fantasia of nineteenth century Europe  to supernatural aspects such as the Witchs glutinous goons (complete with boaters). Unfortunately, the increasingly baggy structure and fluctuating tone  now wartime intrigue, now pretend family heart-warmer  make it harder and harder to engage. The risibly cloying closing scenes are likely to nix any remaining goodwill, blotting out such delicate early touches as a stroll through the air far above a town square.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The Ship That Sank would be a more appropriate title for writer-director Richard Curtiss latest and most disappointing entertainment. Its a cripplingly self-conscious and self-satisfied tribute to the roistering last days of offshore British mid-60s pirate radio before the meanies from the ministry pulled the plugs. <br />Its also the kind of musical comedy where the actors seem to be having more fun than any audience could ever share. This overlong, poorly paced and slackly directed ship-bound farrago not only wastes its treasury of golden oldies  Hendrix, Kinks, Small Faces etc  but magically contrives to reduce the chaotic, creative spirit of the sexual and cultural revolution to a mere mechanical catalogue of trite and surprisingly sentimental sex-drugs-and-rock n roll clichs, each fatally underlined by multiple and repetitive reaction shots.<br />If there are compensations, they come courtesy of a few diverting performances. The movies depressingly few incidences of genuine feeling come from Tom Sturridge who is sweet and appealing as the public schoolboy taken under the wing of his godfather, ships captain and Radio Rock boss Quentin, played by Bill Nighy as a self-parody in made-to-measure Regency-collared suits. Philip Seymour Hoffman does a turn as the radical, Emperor Rosko-like DJ in rivalry with Rhys Ifanss self-serving immoralist Gavin. <br />Elsewhere, pickings are slim: the talented Ralph Brown is wasted  hes cast as Wee Small Hours Bob, a misjudged amalgam, presumably, of Whispering Bob Harris and dysarthric Danny from Withnail &amp; I  and the same is doubly true of such comic talents as Chris ODowd, Rhys Darby and Nick Frost.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Disney Pixar is ramping up the publicity for Toy Story 3 (due next July) by rereleasing its two earlier incarnations in Disney Digital 3D. Toy Story 2 in 3D launches next January, but before that we have its seminal stablemate, and on the evidence of a recent viewing, John Lasseters film hasnt aged at all. Its so ingenious in concept, design and execution that you could watch it on a postage stamp-sized screen and still be engulfed by its charm. That said, theres no denying that 3D has enhanced the experience threefold in the way it lifts the print off the screen and plonks it on the viewers lap. And because it was never made with a third dimension in mind, theres no over-egging of the effects. When Lasseters first computer-generated foray was released back in 1995, it broke boundaries; seeing it nearly 15 years on only highlights its enduring ability to seduce all generations with its wit and spirit. Roll on, Woody!]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This is the sequel that John McTiernan and Arnold Schwarzeneggers 1987 original deserved, as director Nimrod Antal delivers enough hard core sci-fi, explosive action and monster mayhem to justify its belated arrival. Forget the official sequel and the lame Alien vs Predator spin-offs, this Predator sequel deserves one of its own. Armed to the teeth but unknown to one another, a multiracial group of military/criminal killers (plus Topher Graces anomalous wimpy doctor) find themselves on a Predator hunting planet where they are the game. Faced with an evolved generation of super-Predators, Adrien Brodys Hemingway-quoting, self-appointed leader (There is no hunting like the hunting of men . . . ) insists that their survival depends upon pooling their own killer instincts. Alice Bragas svelte sniper is a tough yet tender foil for the buff, brainy Brody; with one notable exception, the remaining dirty half-dozen are merely disposable. Channelling Brandos unhinged Colonel Kurtz, a well-padded Laurence Fishburne pops up halfway through as a surprise sole survivor, a striking cameo that nods to his youthful debut in Apocalypse Now.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
Scotland at the end of the 13th century: William Wallace (Gibson) purposes to free his country from the tyranny of Edward Longshanks (McGoohan). From the opening shots, swirling through the mists o' time over snowy peaks and silvery lochs, to the final torture scenes in which disembowelment provokes only a brave grimace, Gibson's epic offers a stew of Hollywood clichs. Political analysis is not on the menu; this is a tale of heroes 'n' villains, pure and simplistic. The Sassenachs are rude stereotypes, while the Scots are either macho hunks or, should they be aristos, dour quislings. The battle scenes are staged effectively, but for the most part this is a vehicle for Gibson, graduating from cocky <i>Lethal Weapon</i> register to something more one-dimensional and rhetorically solemn. Pure hokum.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Or what Al Gore did next. Whatever the ex-US vice-presidents broader motives for making this film now and embarking on a high-profile world tour, you cant fault his sincerity, rigour and energy as he pleads, with recourse to blinding graphs and damning photo evidence, that we all  especially his fellow countrymen  need to sit up and realise that global warming is neither a wacky theory nor a political manifesto, but stone-cold reality. Its a message, of course, that has most resonance in the United States  one of two countries still to ratify the Kyoto Treaty; the other is Australia  but this unashamed, campaigning documentary also has strong appeal beyond America and succeeds on three main counts: it is utterly convincing, its emotionally powerful and it makes Gore look more charming than he ever did as a presidential candidate.<br />Much of the film is a straight, unfussy record of Gores global lecture tour. Footage of him at the lectern, palatable science and mild gags at the ready, runs alongside a brief history of his awakening to the cause, from his student days in the 1970s to his time in the Senate in the 1980s. Mention of his election loss in 2000 election is brief but pointed. References to the current US administration are short but sharp: Is it possible we should prepare for other threats besides terrorists? he asks. Good question  and one which would still cut short the ambition of any mainstream American politician. The DVD should have a healthy life in classrooms across the country.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[With sales of novelist Stephenie Meyerss vampire romance saga escalating towards a phenomenon, this adaptation reaches cinemas with a core audience ready and waiting (low-teenage girls, judging by the crowd at the screening). Protagonist Bella Swann (Kristen Stewart) is presumably the point of identification. Sent to live with her dad in small-town Washington state, shes the archetypal new girl. Neither geeky outsider nor social magnet, she hardly dares to dream that resident enigmatic hunk Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) would give her a second glance. However, it turns out hes as smitten as she is, but theirs is destined to be a complicated relationship, since hes a hundred-year-old bloodsucker whose powers of restraint are sorely tested by her mere presence. One snog and he might rip out her throat <br />Its hard not to read this as some slightly sinister metaphor for the perils of fornication and the wonders of abstinence, yet at the same time there is something tantalisingly swoony about impossibly elusive gratification. With brooding mist-wreathed mountains an effective backdrop, the key performers strike sparks from the electric tension of not-quite-kissing, though its soon obvious that theres nowhere else for the story to go. Given the tween-accessible rating, blood-drenched carnage isnt an option, and neither the fey, pale-faced vampire clan nor the mild final-reel pursuit carry a significant degree of threat. Some will find it all too polite, but compared to rival blockbuster exercises in explosive CGI mayhem, its character-based index of longing and protectiveness at least provides a viable alternative moodscape.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Funded by grasping capitalist Cornelius Vanderbilt (Boyle), 19th century American adventurer Walker (Harris) and his band of mercenaries invade Nicaragua and join forces with the liberals against the country's corrupt ruler. Despite his disastrous military campaigns and political navet Walker eventually falls into the president's chair (a historical figure, he was self-proclaimed president of Nicaragua from 1855-57). He even makes the cover of <i>Newsweek</i>, because to drive home the obvious contemporary parallels, Cox litters the screen with historical anomalies: Zippo lighters, a Mercedes limo, journos with tape recorders. He presents this fascinating episode, which would have had far more potential as a straight political allegory, as a shambolic, Pythonesque satire. Only Ed Harris seems to have grasped this point: his controlled and credible performance is curiously at odds with a chaotic plot that shoots off in all directions without once finding its target.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[From its powerhouse opening, in which all the gangs of New York gather in tribal splendour in Riverside Drive Park, to the last ditch stand in dilapidated Coney Island, Hill has elevated his story of a novice gang on the run into a heroic epic of Arthurian dimensions, with sex as sorcery and the flick-knife as sword. Anyone expecting gritty realism will be disappointed, because Hill is offering something better: shooting entirely on NY locations at night, he has transformed the city into a phantasmagoric labyrinth of weird tribes in fantastic dress and make-up who move over (and under) the streets as untouched as troglodytes by the civilisation sleeping around them. The novice gang from Coney accidentally encounters some middle class swingers on the subway, and the two groups stare at each other like aliens from different galaxies (while the gang's new female recruit has to be gently restrained from instinctively putting a hand up to straighten her hair). Mixing ironic humour, good music, and beautifully photographed suspense, it's one of the best of 1979.]]></review>

Lopez is Ricki, reluctant homosexual and late-night yoga enthusiast, who charms her way into the hideout apartment to supervise the job. The pain comes in many forms (the sparkless Ben-Jen compound, a bellowing Al Pacino turn, an orgasmic close-up on slack-faced Affleck when he Nails the Lesbian), but most acutely in the impaired-brother subplot and the slavish adherence to Hollywood psychiatry, whereby a disordered mind is tidied by adventure and romance. Mitigating factors: a carefully curated sampling of J-Lo butt cleavage, and an arrhythmic Christopher Walken cameo which momentarily diverts the doomed ship from collision with the iceberg.

      <review><![CDATA['Am I a king or a breeding bull?' Laughton sulkily roars down the dinner table in what is probably the most commercially successful British film ever made. Throughout the film, he manages to hold in tension Henry's greedy enjoyment of the trappings of power and his weary loathing for a life where everything, especially his sexual performance, is a matter of public interest. Laughton's transformation from bullying womaniser to henpecked glutton is a masterly study of a man's decline into dotage, but it is still only the icing on the cake of an amazing exploration of the morbid doubts and fears underlying a seemingly virile masculinity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The age-old story of country boy, urban corruption, and a bad end. The guy is Jimmy Cliff, the city is Kingston, the bad business is the reggae industry, and the crime is killing a cop who's in on the 'ganja' trade. The film's tone is righteously angry, but it doesn't go for the easy targets: it views Cliff's image of himself as a hero as ironically as it denounces police violence and missionary-style religion. Along the way, it offers a richly textured picture of Jamaican shanty-town life, composed with a terrific eye for detail. The action is as gutsy as the well-integrated score, which makes the movie's Hollywood-style gloss a little anomalous, but the basic humour and toughness emerge unscathed.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A film about - among other things - integrity. The basic situation, faithfully adapted from Moravia's novel <i>A Ghost at Noon</i>, concerns a young woman (Bardot) who is gradually possessed by an overwhelming contempt for her husband (Piccoli), a writer beset by doubts when he is called in as script-doctor to a film of <i>The Odyssey</i>, being made by a director (Lang) who wants to capture the reality of Homer's world, and a crass producer (Palance) who just wants more mermaids. Yes, she agrees that the money will be useful; no, she doesn't feel he is selling out since he is interested in the subject; and which ever way he decides to jump is perfectly all right by her. But there still remains that tight knot of contempt which she won't explain and he doesn't understand. Around this Godard weaves subtle parallels with Homer's tale of patient Penelope, the statues of Minerva and Neptune which brood over the modern tragedy, locations which paradoxically set the airy spaces of a flat in Rome against the confines of the Homeric landscapes of Capri, and for good measure a stream of cinematic jokes. Magnificently shot by Raoul Coutard, it's a dazzling fable.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A wonderful film. The message of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> (for which Trumbull did the special effects) was that man needed guidance from beyond; the message of<i> Silent Running</i>, symbolically set in the year 2001, is that man (and his creations: the film's robots) must, even at the risk of madness, be his own saviour. Adrift in space in a literal Garden of Eden that was intended to refurbish an Earth devastated by nuclear war, Bruce Dern refuses to destroy his private world when ordered to. Instead, with the help of his drones (robots), he tends his garden, and then sends it out into deep space to seed a possible second chance for mankind. Full of stunning visuals, the ideas in the film more than compensate for the awkward scene-setting of the beginning.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Both engrossing and alienating, 'Solaris' was Tarkovsky's response to Kubrick's slightly earlier '2001: A Space Odyssey'. The Russian director took issue with what he saw as Kubrick's fetishising of new technology: 'Kubrick is intoxicated with all this and he forgets about man, about his moral problems,' he declared. As such, Tarkovsky's mystical and powerful film sees cosmonaut Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) travel to a troubled (and breathtakingly-designed) space station that hovers above the planet Solaris. Once there, he is forced to deal with the recent suicide of his wife Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk), who is mysteriously resurrected by the strange force of the nearby planet. Tarkovsky mixes sci-fi ephemera with solid human enquiry. The camerawork alone is wondrous. Shame, then, that the film's climax has all the rigour of 'Planet of the Apes'. Still, it's a smart response to the superficial excesses of the sci-fi genre.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[High school graduates Johnny Rico, Dizzy, Carmen and Carl enlist in the armed forces of the Federation. Training takes its toll, and Johnny is on the point of throwing in the towel when space insects wipe out his home town Buenos Aires. The infantry are despatched to the outer limits of the galaxy to give 'em what for, but...you guessed it. An adaptation of a Robert A Heinlein novel, this replays World War II as sci-fi spectacular - and this time we're rooting for the fascists. Presumably director Verhoeven meant it as a sour, ironic joke. If so, he's kept an admirably straight face. His totalitarian utopia looks like a daytime soap: bright, clean, empty. And his lead players might be caricatures of Aryan perfection. It falls to Ironside's motivational teacher/commander, Rasczak, to whip them into shape ('If you don't do your job, I shoot you!'). It says a lot about the director that the movie only kicks into life when the carnage starts. The bugs make up in numbers what they lack in charm, the scale of the battle scenes takes the breath away, and the violence is unremittingly gruesome. On the surface, this is grotesque, reactionary trash, yet by the end, when Verhoeven turns a giant brain-sucking maggot into an object of pity, it's hard not to be impressed by the sheer perversity of the enterprise.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of Wilder's finest, and certainly the blackest of all Hollywood's scab-scratching accounts of itself, this establishes its relentless acidity in the opening scene by having the story related by a corpse floating face-down in a Hollywood swimming-pool. What follows in flashback is a tale of humiliation, exploitation, and dashed dreams, as a feckless, bankrupt screenwriter (Holden) pulls into a crumbling mansion in search of refuge from his creditors, and becomes inextricably entangled in the possessive web woven by a faded star of the silents (Swanson), who is high on hopes of a comeback and heading for outright insanity. The performances are suitably sordid, the direction precise, the camerawork appropriately <i>noir</i>, and the memorably sour script sounds bitter-sweet echoes of the Golden Age of Tinseltown (with has-beens Keaton, HB Warner and Anna Q Nilsson appearing in a brief card-game scene). It's all deliriously dark and nightmarish, its only shortcoming being its cynical lack of faith in humanity: only von Stroheim, superb as Swanson's devotedly watchful butler Max, manages to make us feel the tragedy on view.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When LA punk Otto (Estevez) loses both girl and job, he's hardly prepared for an adventure of mind-blowing proportions when he's conned into helping out a repo man (Stanton). Not only does he find himself in mortal danger while repossessing cars from irate owners, he also gets caught up in a manic world populated by knitting cops, CIA clones, lobotomised nuclear scientists, drippy hippies, UFO freaks, and the roguish Rodriguez Brothers, all in search of a '64 Chevy carrying a lethal cargo. Cox's weird and wonderful first feature defies description, with a plot and characters at once grounded in the seedy reality of Reagan's America and effortlessly enhanced by flights of pure, imaginative fantasy. What distinguishes the movie is its offbeat, semi-satirical sense of humour, seamlessly woven into its wacky thriller plot. But there are endless things to enjoy, from Robby Mller's crisp camerawork to a superb set of performances, from witty movie parodies to a tremendous punk soundtrack.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of Godard's most sheerly enjoyable movies, a  dazzling amalgam of <i>film noir </i>and science fiction in  which tough gumshoe Lemmy Caution turns inter-galactic agent to re-enact the legend of Orpheus and Eurydice by conquering Alpha 60, the strange automated city from which such concepts as love and tenderness have been banished. As in Antonioni's <i>The Red Desert</i> (made the previous year), Godard's theme is alienation in a technological society, but his shotgun marriage between the poetry of legend and the irreverence of strip cartoons takes the film into entirely idiosyncratic areas. Not the least astonishing thing is the way Raoul Coutard's camera turns contemporary Paris into an icily dehumanised city of the future.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ozus final film is a movingly valedictory affair, its familiar story of Ryus elderly widower marrying off daughter Iwashita carrying even more poignancy than usual as a poised and wise reminder of passing time and the inevitable approach of mortality. The gentle humours there as ever, but in the sub-plot showing Ryus former teachers twilight years beset by drink-sodden regrets, the emotions are darker and tougher than previously. The central performance is, of course, a marvel of no-nonsense, unspoken expressiveness, set against exquisitely arranged colour compositions and the directors loveable repertory company in fine fettle. Whether the films making was affected by the death of Ozus mother and the onset of his own final illness is hard to quantify, but it does feel like a leave-taking. A year after its release he died on his sixtieth birthday.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Condemned on its release as harmful to minors, Robert Aldrichs late contribution to the B-noir tradition, by way of Mickey Spillane, couldnt quite find its audience in 1955. But it now stands as a crucial influence on what would become the French new wave, an irresistibly seedy trip through the Los Angeles underworld, and a valuable artifact of Cold War anxiety. After a mysterious woman (debutante actress Cloris Leachman) flags down Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) on a highway and is subsequently murdered, the downmarket private dick reads this chance encounter as his ticket to the big time, and he sniffs out a trail of intrigue through many a gutter and back alley to an unbelievable secret. Cold, calculating, even downright nasty, the antihero Hammer would be focus-grouped right out of existence if he were screenwritten today. And with its delectable period detail and the magnificent compositions and rich depth of field achieved by Aldrich and his cinematographer, Ernest Laszlo, Kiss Me Deadly demands to be seen on the big screen. Go now.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Murnau's last film (after three years of mixed fortunes in Hollywood) was begun as a collaboration with the documentarist Robert Flaherty, but resolved itself into Murnau's purest and least inhibited celebration of physical sensuality and love. Its plot is a simple Pacific islands folk tale: a young man and woman fall in love, thereby violating a local taboo, and their romance ends in inevitable tragedy. The film is a rhapsody of textures and an exceptionally sensuous play of light, rhythm and composition. Its narrative pretext is (necessarily) heterosexual, but Murnau's homosexual sensibility was never clearer: the central image (and texture) of the film is the flesh of its young hero, and it is his virility that sets the tragedy in motion. Fetishistic to a degree, the film is none the less never patronising to its subject or its actors. It plays as a pre-colonial anachronism, rather like one of Melville's South Seas novels. It's extremely beautiful.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Thanks to Lasseter's sure sense of characterisation (and his technical wizardry), the first wholly computer-generated animation feature is a gem. From a familiar premise (toys come alive whenever humans leave the room) the ingenious, witty script proceeds to work marvels. Hitherto, the likes of Mr Potato Head, Slinky the dog, Rex the dinosaur, Bo Peep and Hamm the piggy bank have accepted as their benevolent lawgiver Woody, a pullstring cowboy and Andy's favourite toy. Come the kid's birthday, however, their world is thrown into disarray by new arrival Buzz Lightyear, a Powers Boothe lookalike in hi-tech spacesuit who not only usurps Woody's place in Andy's affections, but doesn't know he's a toy. While kids will get off on the bewitching colours, the slapstick and the action-packed (and expertly paced) story, the film will probably be more fully appreciated by adults, who'll love the snappy, knowing verbal gags, the vivid, deftly defined characters, and the overall conceptual sophistication. After all, Randy Newman songs, mutant toys reminiscent of Bosch or Svankmajer, and a surprisingly affecting foray into existential crisis are hardly conventional Disney fare.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It's rare that sequels improve on their predecessors, especially when the original is as thoroughly inventive, intelligent and enjoyable as Lasseter's seminal, computer animated feature. Nevertheless, this second foray into the world of Woody, Buzz Lightyear, et al, is a work of still greater wit and imagination than the first. Crucially, the film-makers haven't taken the usual 'more is better' route (though there are marvellous new characters), nor have they simply relied on technical developments. Rather, what distinguishes the film is that, in addition to great gags, dazzling action and deft dialogue, it can touch the heart without a hint of bogus sentimentality. That's due to the fact that by the time Woody is swiped from Andy's yard for repair and export by ruthless, antique-collecting Al, it's hard to remember that none of the characters is a 'real' living being. Hence we can become wholly involved not only in Woody's predicament, as he finds himself imprisoned with other Western puppets from a vintage TV series, but in the epic crosstown rescue mission undertaken by his pals. The list of highlights is endless. Kids will love it; adults may react more deeply. Just wonderful.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Byrne gleaned the inhabitants for his hypothetical small town (Virgil, Texas) from mad American tabloids like the <i>Weekly World News</i>, which trades in stories about Mexicans who can read your nose, illegal immigrants from outer space, and suchlike. As the film's on-screen narrator, he wanders through the streets, homes and shopping malls of Virgil during its sesquicentennial 'celebration of specialness' with an air of quizzical, bemused wonder, and meets as rich and strange a bunch of characters as we've seen since Altman's <i>Nashville</i>. Like Altman's film, <i>True Stories</i> has a handful of brilliant musical set pieces, each in a different musical idiom, from gospel to C &amp; W. It's also heir to <i>Nashville</i> in its multiple, interweaving plots and its plethora of vivid performances, notably from Jo Harvey Allen as the Lying Woman, and (best of all) John Goodman as Louis Fyne, the lonely bachelor with a consistent panda bear shape. And that's not the half of it. <i>True Stories</i> is an unprecedented crossbreed: a rock film with a brain, an 'art' movie with belly laughs, a state of the nation address without boredom.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
Drawn from hours of video Eggleston shot while hanging out on the night streets of Memphis, its an oft brutal, oft beautiful ode to partying, fighting, freakish flaneuring and friendship. Attaching no hierarchy to his gaze, he films the wild denizens of the boulevards and tenements in all their outlandish glory, the distance between lens and subject shortened considerably, given the artist himself was often down and dirty with the best of them. Now, in a culture that can produce both Jackass and Gummo, Stranded speaks with a prescient outlaw voice to our increasingly manic present.

      <review><![CDATA[Werner Herzogs latest is another trial by ordeal, and a further chapter in his ongoing muddying of the borders between documentary and feature filmmaking. Rescue Dawn is a pretty straight dramatic account of the real-life story of Dieter Dengler, a German-born US Navy pilot who was shot down over Laos in 1966. Herzog has already told the story of the truly hellish three weeks that followed, in the 1997 doc Little Dieter Needs to Fly; here Christian Bale does justice to the palpable life-force that Dengler showed in that film. Its one of Herzogs smaller features, but visceral, transporting and laced with quiet ironies. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Let the Right One In borrows its title from a Morrissey song, but dont let that put you off. Its an angular and lusty tween horror movie based on John Ajvide Lindqvists bestseller in which lonesome, whey-faced 12-year-old Oskar (Kre Hedebrant) becomes smitten by a young, female vampire named Eli (Lina Leandersson). After initiating an adorable romance in the snow-coated forecourt of their glum housing complex, they soon realise that both of them are baying for blood. Hes privately fantasising about stabbing up his schoolyard tormentors with a pocket knife and she needs to sate an appetite for the red stuff that keeps her from dropping dead again. <br />It might sound a little like recent coffee-table vamp style exercise Twilight, but this is a more sinister and ambiguous work. It runs on similar rails to something like Abel Ferraras The Addiction in that it retools the themes and metaphors that stem from the vampire myth  craving, hostility, impulsiveness, eroticism  and neatly dovetails them with a cool, sort-of-realist examination of the horrors of adolescence and poverty that triumphantly ditches clich and overstatement.<br /><br />Tomas Alfredsons light, subtle direction, combined with DoP Hoyte Van Hoytemas crepuscular visuals, makes the courtship elements all the more tender and the staccato scenes of extreme violence all the more disturbing. The bashful, impassive hue of the central performances also gives the film an anything-could-happen edge: feelings of anger and desire dont provoke hysterical outbursts but remain bewildering within the minds of the juvenile cast.<br /><br />Where the film falters is in its (arguably) reactionary final scenes. Theres an eye-wateringly vicious romantic gesture that celebrates Oskars new-found fondness for violent revenge without ever allowing him to step back and survey the absurd amount of damage that he and the young bullies have wreaked. And for a film that takes time to embrace small, tender details, especially in relation to Oskars sexual awakening, it does precious little to flesh out the bleak context of his relationship with Eli, when eccentric side characters (including a cat lover who is brutally mauled by his own cluster) are thrown in as madcap story padding. But these are mere quibbles as this bruised and brilliant fairy tale is one of the years true originals.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Funny things, dreams. Fascinating for the dreamer, but as dull as a late morning in Slough for anybody else, unless, of course, your guide is Freud. Or, as it turns out, Christopher Nolan, the 39-year-old British director of Memento and The Dark Knight, whose solution to the boredom of other peoples dreams is to collide their woozy, ever-changing, upside-down and roundabout nature with the thrust of a fast-paced, men-on-a-mission movie and a startling visual language that mirrors their strangeness. Better still, the dreams preferred by Nolan include images of Paris folding in on itself and a trackless train thundering through a city. The limited, sleepworld excitements of retaking your A levels ad infinitum or forever missing a flight at the airport dont figure here.<br />Nolan throws a perfect storm of stunts, effects, locations and actors at one big idea: that its possible to pilfer ideas from dreams by a process called extraction, which involves hooking yourself up to a drip, falling asleep and entering the world of the subconscious. The holy grail of this process is to reverse it, which is inception, the planting of a new idea in anothers mind. Thats the trick that experts Dom (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt), aided by new recruits Ariadne (Ellen Page) and Eames (Tom Hardy), try to pull off while hopping from Tokyo to Paris to Mombasa. Theyre working for Saito (Ken Watanabe) in pursuit of business magnate Robert (Cillian Murphy), and their motives vary, from financial to intellectual. But DiCaprio has another driver: the memory of his wife Mal (Marion Cottilard) is haunting him and its going to take a lot of psychological spring-cleaning for him to reconnect with that lost world.<br />All hail Nolan for mastering a higher class of mass entertainment. Like all good science fiction, Inception demands we pay serious attention to pure fantasy on the back of strong ideas and exquisite craft  but it also combines fantasy with real observations about our sleeping lives. Like a dream, Nolans film fades swiftly in the light  but while it lasts, it feels like theres nothing more important to decipher.]]></review>

Its perhaps impressive that The Rebound is so unafraid to embrace clich, but there are limits.<br />Catherine Zeta Jones plays Sandy, the divorced mother of two adorable tots, who finds herself falling for a 24-year-old barista (Justin Bartha). Hes smart, charming and great with the kids, but is he too young? The Rebound has its share of witty repartee and romantic insight, but its lacking in originality or conflict: the romantic trials of two wealthy, good-looking people, whose only barriers to happiness are their own petty insecurities, become tedious, and its not helped by some stilted dialogue and awkward, mannered performances.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Oliver Stone likes to get stuck in where others dont dare and does so again with this documentary, the aim of which is to counter the US medias portrayal of Venezuelas Hugo Chvez (pictured) and fellow Bolivarians, such as Bolivias Evo Morales and Ecuadors Rafael Correa, as mad, bad and dangerous. After a survey of some of the wilder TV reports and a recap of Chvezs rise, Stone hotfoots it around South America, interviewing seven leaders on the fly, with exposed cameras, wires and lights lending a guerilla feel. Critics claim the film is unbalanced, and, yes, Stones film is a presidents-eye view of their countries  but when that same view is so routinely distorted or ignored elsewhere, theres a need for this film, and anyone who doesnt clock where Stones sympathies lie is not concentrating (the triumphant music is a giveaway). Watch, enjoy and start paying attention to the region. This is a spirited and necessary primer, not the last word on its subject.]]></review>

This man-made creature has got shears instead of hands, because his creator (Price) died mid-project. He sits lonely and lethal in his gloomy mansion, until the Avon Lady (Wiest) comes to call. She invites him home, and he proceeds to dazzle her family and neighbours with his flair for topiary and surreal hair-styling. With its skewed vision of suburbia, Burton's film bears comparison with his earlier <i>Pee-Wee's Big Adventure</i>. It's a visual treat, complete with pastel bungalows, surreal shrubbery and grotesque outfits, but it remains curiously hollow.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This ghost story from the haunters' perspective (co-scripted by Michael McDowell) provides some of the most surprisingly enjoyable viewing in years. The drearily happy Maitlands (Baldwin and Davis) drive into the river, come up dead, and return to their beloved, quaint house as spooks intent on despatching the hideous New York yuppie family which had usurped their property. The humour unfolds as the horrible Deetzes (Jones and O'Hara) fill the house with revolting avant-garde art, bulldozers, and camp interior designers spitting venom; while only their mournful teenage daughter (Ryder) seems either aware of or in tune with the ghostly couple, whose failure to shine in the scare stakes finally drags them into the arms of the gunslinger-exorcist Betelgeuse (Keaton), a kind of OTT demonic Clint Eastwood of the underworld (who rids houses of unwanted humans). Off-the wall humour and some sensational sight gags make the movie, maddeningly disjointed though it sometimes is, a truly astonishing piece of work.]]></review>

Biggest hit of all was 'Secret Love', the title of which, combined with the spectacle of Doris tomboyin' around in buckskins and britches (her exploits include the abduction of pouting showgirl McLerie), anecdotally made the film quite precious to lesbian audiences of the time.

      <review><![CDATA[Even by latter-day Hammer standards, writer-director Clemens transfuses movie vampire lore outrageously, and introduces conventions from a host of other pulp forms. Kronos is an unmistakably Germanic comic strip hero with a crusading zeal for his profession (Stan Lee out of Lang's <i>Siegfried</i>). By medieval standards he's distinctly cosmopolitan - carries a samurai sword, smokes dope, meditates; is accompanied on his travels by the scholarly Hieronymous Grost as he rescues distressed damsels from pillory or despatches bullies in Falstaffian taverns. Though Clemens manages sly quotes from the likes of <i>Nosferatu</i> and <i>The Seventh Seal</i>, the film has absolutely no pretensions beyond being a thoroughly endearing entertainment, and succeeds admirably despite the pastiche of incongruous conventions.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Half the world can repeat half the dialogue of Curtizs great wartime (anti-)romance, re-released in a new digital restoration for Valentines Day, and half of Hollywoods scriptwriters worked on it. If Peter Bogdanovich is right to say the Bogart persona was generally defined by his work for Howard Hawks, his Rick, master of the incredibly ritzy Moroccan gin-joint into which old Paris flame Ingrid Bergman walks, just as importantly marked his transition from near-psychopathetic bad guy to idiosyncratic romantic hero. <br />Sixty-odd years on, the film still works beautifully: its complex propagandist subtexts and vision of a reluctantly martial Americas stumbling morality still intrigue, just as Bogarts cult reputation among younger viewers still obtains. Claude Rains is superb as the pragmatic French chief of police, himself a complex doppelgnger of Bogart; Paul Henreid is credible and self-effacing as the films nominal hero; Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre give great colour; and Bergman literally shines. Arguably, cinemas greatest accidental masterpiece, it still amounts to some hill of beans.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A dozen or so under-rehearsed chorines in suspenders shuffle through a bit of a number involving buckets and mops, and that's as near as this quota-quickie musical gets to Busby Berkeley. Long considered a 'lost' Powell and only lately rediscovered, it confirms the director's 'never say die' credo, here applied to a sluggish scenario which draws on such '30s indicators as a plumber who's really a lord, a publicity-mad film star and some comic Bolsheviks. (There can't be many English-language movies with a heroine named Leninia.) The songs are quite amusing in the cabaret style of the day, and the low key, fretful persona of Jerry Verno is not unattractive.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Six months after the death of Eric Rohmer at the age of 89, the BFI is re-releasing a good-looking new print of My Night with Maud, the French filmmakers 1969 work which, a decade into his slow mutation from Cahiers critic to director, made his name outside of France and preceded such enduring works as Pauline at the Beach and The Green Ray.<br />The title suggests some sort of saucy nocturnal encounter, but the truth is more austere, if no less captivating. The film gives us Jean-Louis (Jean-Louis Trintignant), a dapper 34-year-old engineer with a good line in wry, toothy smiles who works for Michelin in Clermont-Ferrand. Hes lived in Canada and Chile, enjoyed a few girlfriends, but now hes single, serious and more committed to his religion and future.<br /><br />We meet Jean-Louis in church, on Christmas Eve, where he spies a young blonde, Franoise (Marie-Christine Barrault), who he determines to marry. He follows her in his car, but she soon disappears and he bumps into Vidal (Antoine Vitez), an old friend and teacher at the local university. Vidal is an atheist and Marxist who has less rigid ideas about love and marriage, and their chat allows Rohmer to explore various ideas relating to life, relationships and our place in the world before (or perhaps in the absence of) God.<br />Vidal invites Jean-Louis for dinner at the flat of his sometime lover Maud (Franoise Fabian), a good-looking, liberal doctor whos a divorcee and single mother. When Vidal leaves for the evening and encourages Jean-Louis to stay with Maud, theres a brief will-they-wont-they episode  but Rohmer is more interested in behaviour and motive than titillation. Using Maud as a moral torch, he shines a light on Jean-Claudes ideas. But Maud is more than just a foil: shes a complex, alluring, smart character, an encapsulation of modern thinking with whom we sympathise as much as anyone else. The same can be said of Franoise, the blonde, who re-enters the film and Jean-Louiss life: shes more than she appears.<br />In an interview with long-time associate Barbet Schroeder not long before he died , Rohmer identified two traits in his films which he hoped hed mastered: an easy naturalism and a willingness to present the discussion of ideas. My Night with Maud offers both in spades, although those familiar with Rohmers breezier but no less inquiring 1980s films might be a little surprised by the rigour and bookishness of this wintry, black-and-white work (the crisp photography of Clermont-Ferrand at Christmas is especially striking). Talk was never cheap in Rohmers films; here, some knowledge of Pascals Wager and various tenets of Catholicism wouldnt go amiss if youre to gain the most from the characters intense chats about religion and atheism, chance and determinism, love and desire. But, as ever, Rohmer gives us a playful slice of life which has the effortless air of reality and challenges us to think about life afresh.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Fleischer's dystopian sci-fi - adapted from Harry Harrison's <i>Make Room! Make Room!</i> - may have its flaws (it gets a bit messagey and sentimental at times, and the ending is not as surprising as it could be), but it certainly knocks the silly juvenilia epitomised and inspired by <i>Star</i> <i>Wars</i> and <i>ET</i> for six. In some respects not unlike the (admittedly more complex) <i>Blade Runner</i>, it envisages the year 2022 as so ravaged by over-population, pollution and climate change that New York has become a teeming Babel of 40 million. Heston is the cop investigating the murder of an executive of the company that produces the titular synthetic food on which everyone now depends for survival; Robinson, wonderful in his final role, is his pal, savouring memories of earlier, better times as he nears death. Good, solid stuff, assembled efficiently enough to be pretty persuasive.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Not only a movie sequel, but a follow-up to the 1967 TV series episode <i>Space Seed</i>, in which Captain (now Admiral) Kirk exiled cosmic renegade Khan to the outer limits, where he's been hatching revenge ever since. Foregoing the special effects bonanza of its predecessor, it settles for low camp humanoid melodrama. The ageing Shatner and his equally self-amused Enterprise cohorts now 'boldly go' wreathed in soft focus, smiling down on a shipful of apprentice Trekkies until summoned to urgent comic strip action when Khan threatens to reverse creation with a destructively-wielded Genesis device. The net effect, between embarrassed guffaws, is incredulity: a movie at once post-TV and pre-DW Griffith.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Claude Whatham continues his love affair with the past, moving back from working class youth of the '50s in <i>That'll Be the Day</i> to middle class children of the '20s in this adaptation of Arthur Ransome's story, which used to be required reading for all well brought up kids. Dealing with the adventures of six children one suitably idyllic summer holiday spent messing about in boats in the Lake District, it comes over as a labour of love rather than a commercial proposition. Period detail is strong, and the children gain in confidence as the story develops, but it's probably too slight to hold the attention of either children or accompanying adults, though individual scenes work, like the meeting with the charcoal-burners, and Sophie Neville is very good as one of the kids. It's pleasant/innocuous, depending on your frame of mind.]]></review>

Burdened by excessive respect for its source novel (Conrad's <i>Heart of Darkness)</i>, this is a film of great effects (a flaming bridge, Wagnerian air strikes) and considerable pretension (quotes from TS Eliot). The casting of Brando is perhaps the acid-test: brilliant as movie-making, but it turns Vietnam into a vast trip, into a War of the Imagination.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Too often glibly dismissed as a purveyor of gloom, Leonard Cohen stands as an minence grise among songwriters, his recorded legacy as notable for the imposing literary certitude of his lyrics as their technically limited, characteristically expressive baritonal delivery. At various times poet, consort of beautiful women and Zen monk, his biogs intriguing too, all of which makes this doc highly welcome, even if its at best a partial view.Thats partly due to its patchwork construction, which intercuts musical numbers (and gushing accolades) from an all-star tribute show in Sydney with Cohens own pithy recollections, before the old boy wheezes through a climactic number with a reverent U2. Although the performers are variable  Rufus Wainwright brings out the best in the songs, his sister Martha does not, while Jarvis Cocker and Nick Cave man the roster creditably  they certainly sell Cohens catalogue to neophytes. Probably just as well though, given the puzzling absence of clips of the man in his prime.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The indomitable spirit of the downtrodden New York micro-budget indie lives! Writer-director Ronald Bronsteins self-financed, 16mm, seemingly autobiographical debut welcomes you to the inauspicious world of Keith Sontag (Dore Mann), a scruffy, socially awkward suburban New Yorker blessed with that most devastating and contradictory of qualities: pure solicitousness. Ever adopting Columbos characteristic pose  hand self-apologetically shading the eyes  Keith, with his damning combination of need and entreaty, insistence and self-doubt, awkwardness and apology, is a good guy to leave alone, as his only (reluctant) friend Sandy knows. <br />Its all very mumblecore: annoying and hard to watch. But Frownland is compulsive, too. Not only the soundscape  taken from the discordant electronic compositions of Keiths musician flatmate or the aural effluence of the suburban streets where he works as the worlds worst cold-caller  is deceptively artless; the performances are equally so. Of them, Manns is, not surprisingly, remarkably self-effacing and helps no end in giving this admittedly difficult film not only its black comic tone but also its deep, discomfiting emotional tug.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Weve seen the effect Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had on one Indian slumdog, but elsewhere in the world its Pop Idol that gives a voice to the marginalised. The final of Afghan Star was watched by a third of the population and many of those who voted had never encountered democracy before. This formulaic but fascinating documentary follows four competitors from the comical audition stage through to the nerve-racking finale. <br />And while its style and structure conform to the well-worn template established by docs like Spellbound, its success lies in creating an accessible, fun way into serious issues. Music was outlawed by the Taliban for more than five years, so the mere existence of such a programme is revolutionary. Talent shows may be frivolous in the West, but to watch singers risking their lives to appear on the show and viewers trading their belongings for sim cards so they can text their votes, is a sobering reminder of how much we take for granted.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When American anti-corporate pranksters The Yes Men released their first documentary in 2004, I wasnt convinced they were any more politically incisive than Ali G. This new compendium of the duos elaborate hoaxes from the past four years is more persuasive  and funnier too. The suited pair, who come across as performance artists as much as activists, pose as Exxon employees at a petroleum conference and introduce a new bio-fuel made from human flesh; they announce in New Orleans that all boarded-up housing projects will reopen a year after Katrina; they hand out a fake copy of The New York Times in New York, with stories born only of wishful thinking (Iraq War Ends). You have to admire their ability both to pull off these stunts and to extract such honest expressions of greed from such corporate victims as the businessman who agrees that companies can justify deaths on the path to commercial success. Comic and creepy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[That this Argentine film won this years Best Foreign Language Oscar over The White Ribbon and A Prophet says more about the voters than the films. Essentially a grand, time-hopping police procedural of Inspector Morse levels of ingenuity, souped up with some naff music, heavily filtered camerawork and a theme of romantic longing spanning 25 years, its a film of enormous pretension and not enough reward.<br />We move between 1974 and the late 1990s. In the films present, former prosecutor, grey-haired Benjamn (Ricardo Darn) is writing a novel inspired by a key episode in his career: the case, 25 years earlier, of the rape and murder of a beautiful young woman. This was an event which pitched go-getting, principled Benjamin against judicial corruption (a symptom, we assume, of the military dictatorship) and cemented his unspoken feelings for his better-educated, better-bred new boss, Irene (Soledad Villamil), whose arrival in their wood-panelled offices coincides with this death. <br />The hunt for the killer takes up much of the two-hour-plus running time and is diverting enough, while the later penning of Benjamins book causes him to revisit both his friendship with Irene and the legacy of this case (calling for ample whitening of hair and dodgy make-up). Its this cross-cutting and sense of time past and lost thats meant to inspire a gradual embrace of big themes, but the twin, shallow and pretty obvious ones that emerge are, firstly, that injustice breeds injustice and, secondly, that true love will triumph in the end. Cue orchestra!]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Murnau's classic vampire movie, though not his best film, remains one of the most poetic of all horror films. Its power derives partly from Schreck's almost literally sub-human portrayal of the Count, respelendent with long ears and fingers and a wizened, skeletal face, partly from the sexual undercurrents coursing through the movie which suggest that the vampire is a threat not only to bougeois society and its emphasis upon scientific rationality, but also to the very marriage of the Harker couple. A film that survives repeated viewings.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Though Robert Benton's film may not be as richly rewarding as underrated <i>Nobody's Fool</i>, it does share the earlier film's its leading actor (Newman) and writer (Richard Russo), and its gentle, semi-comic humanism which investigates the themes of ageing and failure while paying tribute to the enduring virtues of honour and friendship. It tells the labyrinthine but fundamentally familiar <i>noir</i> story of a private dick - ex-cop, ex-husband and father, and ex-drunk Harry Ross (Newman) - getting entangled in a web of blackmail, corruption and murder after he reluctantly agrees to deliver an envelope for his former movie-star pal Jack (Hackman). But friendship, it seems, has its limits: not only is Harry, who lodges with and works as a handyman for the cancer-stricken Jack and his wife Catherine (Sarandon), ready to indulge his long-harboured desires for the latter, but when he delivers Jack's package to the mysterious Gloria, he finds instead a dying man. If there's nothing particularly original about Benton's film, there's still much to enjoy - notably, a crop of solid, charismatic performances and cameraman Piotr Sobocinski's restoration LA to its near-mythic <i>noir</i> glory. Far from breeding contempt, familiarity here produces its own peculiar pleasures. Indeed, what makes the film satisfying is its quiet, effortless assurance, as easy-going as in a late Hawks movie. Modest, intelligent and very engaging.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Life in post-apartheid South Africa becomes a poor mans City of God in this bullet-riddled Johannesburg gangsta chronicle which never quite manages enough socio-political heft to disguise its rampant genre clichs. The boyhood pal along for the criminal ride, the idolised neighbourhood crook, the disapproving mum, the turncoat former associate, the climactic rooftop confrontation  its all here and more, in a movie which quotes from Michael Manns Heat in a key heist set piece. <br />Writer-director Ralph Ziman strings it all together with slick competence, but given that leading man Rapulana Seiphemo does a persuasive line in moral ambiguity, its disappointing that the proceedings too often default to glib shoot-em-up rather than digging deeper into the historical moment. Loosely based on actual events, the film suggests that while waiting for the new South Africa, disgruntled township residents like Seiphemos Lucky twisted the politics of entitlement into a ready excuse for their own rampaging criminality  but ultimately cant decide whether to condemn or condone such action. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
Lovely Paro (Rai) has been carrying a torch (literally) for childhood playmate Devdas (Khan) ever since the Mukherjees packed him off to London for a bespoke education. His mother has missed him, too, but her petulance when he first calls on Paro on his way home suggests she'd hardly welcome any notion of the sweethearts' wedding. Nor would class-conscious disciplinarian Mr Mukherjee sway her. So it is that Devdas comes to drown his sorrows at the brothel of famed courtesan Chandramukhi (Dixit), who's instantly smitten. Sarat Chandra Chatterjee's 1917 novel <i>Devdas</i> unfolds an epic love triangle likened to that in Indian mythology between Krishna, Radha and Meera. It's been filmed numerous times, though never at this expense. It really needs saying that the Mukherjees consider themselves a class apart from their neighbours, because from all the visual evidence (the families occupy residences of such palatial splendour that the director resorts to fish-eye lenses and daft camera angles to fit them in his frame) you wouldn't guess either was wanting for status.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Paul (Schneider) is quite the ladies' man, except that he's running out of ladies in the small North Carolina milltown that is the one thing he's never left. But when his buddy's sister Noel (the extraordinary Deschanel) comes home from boarding school, there's something about her which knocks him back. Could be this one's for keeps. It's simple enough in story terms, but writer/director David Gordon Green (in his follow-up to <i>George Washington</i>) isn't much interested in telling ir straight. Typically, he'll drop in to a scene halfway through, and cut out of it before there's any kind of resolution. The effect is of eavesdropping. You get glimpses of emotional exposure, and divine the rest for yourself. Sometimes the skewed heartland poetics veer towards the cute - cameraman Tim Orr never saw a sun ray he didn't like, and was it really necessary to make Paul's mom a clown? But in a sense even the mis-steps work in the film's favour. Like a vulnerable, ardent suitor, the clumsiness bespeaks its own sincerity. Of the all too few American independents to have emerged in the last decade (Harmony Korine, Vincent Gallo), Green looks like the guy most likely to put together a body of work. I think he's the real deal.]]></review>

Affectionate and engaged, the film traces an extraordinary century of political shifts and geographic displacement in tandem with an observational account of everyday contemporary life. Hopkins himself is a very visible presence  not least when attempting to remember and list, in the local language, the full titular repertoire of sheep-usage under the beady eye of an elder  and his editorial position raises a potent raft of concerns without simply bemoaning the fact of change.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Scouring the morally abstruse hinterland of mergers, acquisitions and venture capitalism, this Teutonic nightmare from gifted Berlin School writer-director Christian Petzold is a welcome addition to the current cycle of German films (alongside Downfall, Good Bye Lenin!  and The Lives of Others) which deal confidently and directly with the countrys turbulent recent history. Yella (played with a spectral simplicity by Nina Hoss) is a business-savvy divorcee based in the sleepy East German town of Wittenberge. Looking to make a clean break with her past, she accepts a job as an accountant for a company in Hanover, but tragedy strikes when her resentful ex-husband trys to kill her by careering his Land Rover into the Elbe. Managing to claw herself away from the wreckage, she eventually reaches her destination but discovers the job she was promised doesnt exist. A chance meeting with crotchety loner Phillip leads to some lucrative freelance investment work and the couple roam the country crushing smaller companies with their superior business smarts.</p><p>As their professional relationship soon blossoms into love, Yella and Phillip become the business equivalent to Bonnie and Clyde with a laptop in place of a Tommy gun and stacks of accounting spreadsheets in place of bullets. But the drab, overcast landscapes are awash with supernatural forces which are constantly reminding Yella of a dark secret from her past. With its sardonic use of ultra-functional mise en scne redolent of Laurent Cantets Time Out juxtaposed with random blurts of Lynchian aural dissonance (the repeated use of Julie Driscolls Road to Cairo is especially ghostly), Petzolds film is an expertly crafted thriller which offers a pessimistic, though deeply rewarding, glimpse of a society being haunted by its own past.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The inexplicable popularity of the talking-animal genre has led to numerous crimes against cinema, especially since the advent of lip-sync CGI. But few have been as egregious as this adaptation of cosy comic strip Marmaduke, first sketched by Brad Anderson in 1954, which is a fair indication of how old the jokes are. <br />The screenwriters attempt to update the timeworn concept of a loveable great dane causing havoc for his all-American family by moving the entire enterprise to Orange County. Cue the theme to The OC, a show cancelled three years ago but which the writers have bizarrely opted to use as a template, transforming Marmaduke from a cutesy family comedy into a berserk all-canine high-school acceptance drama, complete with mean jock dogs, outsider nerd dogs, dumb cheerleader dogs, keg parties under the pier and surfing competitions. For dogs. This idea is almost weird enough to work, but its let down by the feeble characterisation, sickening special effects, an obnoxious human cast, an overall sense of smugness and a complete absence of good jokes.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An impressive directorial debut by ex-art director Shadi Abdelsalam, <i>The Night of Counting the Years</i> is an examination of cultural imperialism in reverse: instead of selling Coca-Cola to Egypt, Western merchants are stealing rarities from Egyptian tombs. At first posed in moral terms - should the new chief of an Egyptian tribe allow his people to earn money by selling the antiquities from 'officially' undiscovered tombs, or stop the trade at the cost of stopping the flow of money to his poverty-stricken people - the film develops into a study of the importance of defending the past from would-be cultural exploiters. Slow-moving but absorbing, and quite beautifully shot.]]></review>

The house, of course, is peopled by a surefire stockpot of picturesque characters, from seedy doctor and gay black to lesbian actress and chatty tart, not forgetting the tyro writer (Bell) who falls for Caron and draws literary inspiration from their story.

      <review><![CDATA[As with many film franchises, you could string together all three of these money-spinners and not notice the joins. The trouble with this third instalment, though, is that a) its Arthurian premise is dispiritingly conventional and b) the pop culture references are starting to wear thin. <br />Shrek the Third centres on hammy wannabe actor Prince Charming (voice of Rupert Everett) who, it turns out, isnt that charming after all. In fact hes a spoiled egomaniac who loves himself more than his heckling audiences do. When Charmless finds out that the dying King Harold (John Cleese) has asked his ogre of a son-in-law, Shrek to seek out his natural successor (a distant nephew called Arthur Pendragon), he seizes the opportunity to organise an ego-boosting coup against the meek civilians of Far Far Away. With Shrek (Mike Myers) and his wise-cracking sidekick Donkey (Eddie Murphy) away in search of the new king, its left to the loveable ogres beloved wife Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and her bevy of fairytale femme fatales to kick a few butts into touch. But thats not all, theres a sub-plot boiling away in Shreks mind and it involves babies<br />Despite a number of protracted moments, a few scenes are truly inspired: the dying-frog sequence for one, and Shreks Exorcist-inspired nightmare about parenthood for another. Some jokes sail close to innuendo, but in the main theyre balanced enough to appeal to all ages. The CG animation, too, is as refined as weve come to expect. Just a shame it lacks the smart sassiness of its predecessors. Time to call time, we think.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Since Arnies been busy, Hollywood has been looking for a new family-friendly muscle-man. Vin Diesel failed in The Pacifier, so step up Dwayne The Rock Johnson, who can arch his eyebrows while looking large next to a child. The kid in question is precocious Peyton (Madison Pettis), who confronts Johnsons quarterback star, claiming to be his daughter. <br />Vaguely humorous clashes follow as Joe attempts to be a good dad for the cameras, leaves his child in a bar, or reels in horror as his suits are ruined. Things get soppy when the grumpy bear starts to mellow. The editings loose, and every scene runs a full minute longer than it should. <br />Still, Johnsons amiable performance makes this watchable for the target audience; namely sporty daddies and spoiled little girls primed to assimilate their lives into the Disney brand. No shortage of product placement here.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This is a jailbreak movie, if not in the usual sense: Juliette (Kristin Scott Thomas, displaying her fluent French) has served her time and left prison in the legal manner; but the gravity of her crime, the bitter response of her husband and family, and 15 years in jug have all ensured that ordinary freedoms mean little to her. La (Elsa Zylberstein), the much younger sister taught by her parents to consider herself an only child, takes her in, and French director Philippe Claudels touching film follows the gradual breaking down of hard-won defences and the shy beginning of trust.<br /><br />Las husband is hostile; their two small adopted daughters are sweet but poignant reminders of what Juliette has lost. But if these characters  and a couple of interested men  drive the expected prodigal daughter narrative, it is the contrast between stately, closed Juliette and La herself, with her jittery determination to be loved, that bring the film to life. It takes a gutsy first-time writer-director to make a film so understated: Ive Loved You So Long takes tiny steps like a newly released prisoner. But Claudel understands that his drama lies in letting two superb actresses build their characters, forge their relationship and examine their grief. The reveal isnt the point; Scott Thomas joining the land of the living is. Still, there is a reveal, so in deference to Claudels wish to have his prison gruel and eat it, Im not going to divulge Juliettes crime. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The Nancy of the title refers to Nancy Spungen, the late, bleach-blonde hellcat paramour of deceased Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious, who died of a knife-wound to the abdomen in the early morning of October 12 1978 in New Yorks Chelsea Hotel. Director and punk historian Alan G Parker has one aim: to clear the name of Vicious  thought by tabloid newspapers and the NYPD to have carried out the deed in a drugged stupor  by exhuming police evidence and extracting testimonies from numerous scenesters and friends of the departed. Generally, the torrent of lurid anecdotes keeps things moving along nicely, as do the series of animated inserts which almost compensate for the dearth of archive footage and Sex Pistols music. </p><p>Yet Parkers film feels clouded by his obvious posthumous adoration of the enigmatic Sid. His witnesses are less than credible and his argument feels fumbled. You feel that the conclusion, where the evidence suggests another person could have killed Nancy, should have been Parkers starting point.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[We all know what to expect from Asylum Films by now: poorly rendered mutant CGI sea creatures, thumpingly blunt dialogue (It wasnt an explosion  it was giant piranha!) and one confused-looking 80s popstar wondering what shes got herself into. Following the appearance of Debbie Gibson in Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus, this time theyve managed to rope in poor Tiffany, who stands about looking startled as a genetic scientist whose attempts to feed the Venezuelan poor by breeding super-resilient fish (why dyou start with piranhas, Tiff?) have, unsurprisingly, gone slightly off the rails. Shes ably supported by lantern-jawed US agent Jason Fitch (Paul Logan), whom none of the filmmakers seem to have noticed has a name which sounds quite a lot like fish, leading to inevitable confusion. Bad-movie enthusiasts will doubtless have fun watching these oversized piscine predators leaping from the ocean and laying waste to Floridas coastal regions, but hasnt this tiresome, kitschy, so-bad-its-good fad run its course?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Unlike so many big budget productions, the first movie instalment of JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth trilogy doesn't condescend to a teenage audience, but creates a sophisticated universe which abides by its own laws: a primordial world older than history and legend, back in the realm of myth. Here young hobbit Frodo Baggins (Wood) comes into possession of the ring of power - a talisman of evil so potent it corrupts everyone who touches it. Under the guidance of the wizard Gandalf (McKellen), Frodo escapes the clutches of the fearsome ring wraiths along with his faithful friend Sam (Astin), and heads for the kingdom of the elves, where they hope to thwart the encroaching forces of doom. Mostly, the film makes light work of Tolkien's richly Celtic imagination. You don't so much admire its virtuoso camerawork as lose yourself in the grandeur of the Gothic design, the bucolic Shire and mountain ranges riddled with mines and fire pits. Granted, there's a sermonising element which invites  parody, but it never wants for menace (parents should  probably steer young children clear). In unveiling the Holy Grail for action-fantasy aficionados, director and co-writer Peter Jackson has begun a series to rival <i>Star Wars</i> in the pantheon.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[Black never goes out of fashion and nor, it seems, does noir. The last year has given us several contemporary spins on the genre: jaded, self-referential pastiche in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, hyper-stylised comic-book ultraviolence in Sin City and now, with Brick, a patter-heavy gumshoe procedural with a high-school setting. The milieu of wobbly-voiced kingpins, teen temptresses and a world-weary shamus who barely shaves is a high concept that could easily fall flat, but, through a judicious balance of heightened plotting and dialogue and a straight-faced engagement with violence and jeopardy, the film comes off less Bugsy Malone than Bogey Begins.<br />The plot is as chewy as the genre demands, with Brendan ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt) setting out to find and then avenge his drug-using ex Emily (Emilie de Ravin) after he receives an uncharacteristic plea for help. True to noir form, his pursuit takes him across boundaries of high, low and outlaw society, with an archetypal rogues gallery mapped on to the high school ecosystem with satisfying facility: the lug, the rich girl, the dope fiend and the femme fatale all find credible underage counterparts, often played by actors with juvenile records in the biz: Lukas Haas (Witness, Mars Attacks!), for instance, is relishably offbeat as local drug lord The Pin. But its Gordon-Levitt (freakily adult in Third Rock from the Sun, heartbreaking in Mysterious Skin) who cements the whole thing: understated to the point of near-invisibility, his Brendan still has killer smarts, balls of steel, a natty line in put-downs and the shrugging acknowledgement of all Hammett-style heroes that the price of knowledge is violence visited on the body.<br />Despite some uncertainty of pace at its top and tail, the plot is consistently engaging. But Brick is at its most sheerly enjoyable when teetering on the brink of ridiculousness  a glimpse of The Pins home life with his mom, Brendans showdown with a shouty vice-principal standing in for the disgruntled police chief (a delicious cameo for Richard Roundtree)  and it only rarely stumbles. The self-consciously mannered rat-a-tat-tat dialogue also mines a neat overlap between teen slang and noir patois, both of which can be indecipherable to non-initiates (the press notes helpfully include a glossary). <br />Yet in other ways Brick is surprisingly plausible. Shooting on his home turf of southern California, Johnson eschews conventionally noirish cityscapes for flat, muted expanses and exploits the sinister potential of the everyday, generating almost Lynchian unease through the sense of unspeakable secrets eavesdropped upon. This is heightened by the films canny use of sound: a Ford Mustang growls like a lion while the quickening pattering threat of footsteps on concrete is eerily offset (as in The Birds) by the naive sound of piano practice  and ultimately converted into a cartoon klang! when the pursuer comes a cropper. Its a characteristic moment: violent, chuckling and insisting to be taken on its own terms.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Man and nature tend to rub up against each other in odd ways in the films of Andrew Ktting, a British artist whose many projects extend to short films, installations and collaborations with the likes of musician Jem Finer and writer Iain Sinclair. This is Kttings third feature after Gallivant and This Filthy Earth, his first in French (a quirk of funding) and perhaps his most conventional, at least in terms of its look. On paper, Ivul sounds like melodrama: a teenage boy, Alex (Jacob Auzanneau), abandons his familys isolated rural home to live in the trees after his father suspects him of fiddling with his sister of a similar age. But the textures of the film prove more interesting than the facts, which are little more than a canvas for Kttings more esoteric visual and sonic explorations: he inserts archive footage, employs time-lapse photography and adopts an entrancing mix of music and other sounds to explore the feelings and behaviours that emerge from his tale of teenage lust and isolation. It may lack some of the earthy kick of his previous two films, but Ivul still shows Ktting as an outsider force to be reckoned with.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Read our interview with the director of Coco Before Chanel here</i><br />Before Chanel, Coco was a dirt-poor child abandoned at an orphanage: hardly original territory for a biopic. But if it hadnt been for her tough early life  itinerant father, years in care, brief early career as a tavern singer  she might never have had the gumption to found an iconoclastic fashion house. Coco wasnt always Chanel, but she was never ordinary. <br />Anne Fontaines film has two interests: clothes and Audrey Tautou. The outfits are purposefully terrible: Cocos early homemade monstrosities may have been original, but they didnt have much else over the corseted excesses of the Edwardian era. But Tautou is wonderful  a black-eyed urchin so sullen and furious you forget how beautiful she is until she smiles. Not that she has a great deal to smile about, trapped in poverty and in Paris with no idea what to make of her life. <br />Attempting to flee the restrictions she was born with, she turns up on a rich but boorish lovers doorstep and starts cutting down mens clothes. These are the keys to her personality, and director Anne Fontaine handles them with respect. It must have been tempting to make the clothes prettier and the lover, Belsan (Benot Poelvoorde), more chivalrous, but that kind of compromise would hardly have been true to the spirit of a heroine who was never one for seeing anyone elses viewpoint, much less accommodating it. Belsan treats her abominably, but he also introduces her to the high life and to handsome Arthur Boy Capel (Alessandro Nivola): its hard to say which she takes to more. <br />Fontaines film is gorgeous, but its beauty is practical, almost textile, like a Chanel tweed.  It has its own excesses: if Boy had been the hero we see here, hed have snorted at convention and married her. But, Chanel, an inveterate fantasist who fabricated her origins as assiduously as her suits, would have preferred this version. Only a late flashback, before the glamorous finale, is unworthy  Tautou, her heavy-browed little face a-glimmer with memory, simply doesnt require its help.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[More conventional than his ambitious Trilogy and less heart-on-the-sleeve than his caper/drama The Right of the Weakest, the versatile Belgian director Lucas Belvauxs latest is, nevertheless, a tense hostage-thriller with a difference.<br /><br />It kicks off in central Paris with its quarry, rich company chairman Stan Graff (Yvan Attal) in full flight: dropping arrogant asides to his colleagues as he prepares to accompany the President of the Republic overseas, then dropping in briefly on his mistress in their secret flat before dropping a small fortune on a lengthier visit to the poker tables. When a Marseille-based gang kidnaps him the following morning, his company looks good for coming up with the 50 million ransom. But as the media, police and interior ministry interfere, his firm gets cold feet, the unions balk and his familys sense of shock increases, his neck gets closer and closer to the chopping block.<br />Belvaux, aided by elegant work from cinematographer Pierre Milon, orchestrates an extensive and dove-tailing cast, the relay of information, dramatic police chases and swift changes of pace and negotiating stance with old-fashioned Melvillian sang froid and teasing emotional restraint. As we constantly intercut to a disintegrating Graff, the ironies of the unfortunate mans menacing predicament are allowed to quietly compound (if not settle) in a pleasing counterpoint to the frenzied action outside. Its obvious Belvaux is having fun in his impassive portrait of a poor little rich man undone by not only fortune and fate but his own misdeeds and blind arrogance; but the director is never so indulgent as to spoil what is a finely mounted thriller.]]></review>

Five mutually antipathetic teens are called in for Saturday detention at a suburban American high school. Initial bouts of verbal jousting fade, making way for a bonding session fugged in pot smoke, the development of friendship everlasting (or until bell rings for class on Monday morning, whichever is the sooner) and That Simple Minds Song. Which would be fine, were the characters not a punchable quintet of overdrawn saps, the acting (Ringwald and Hall excepted) overplayed and unsympathetic, and the script the wrong side of the line that separates smart from smart-arse. Its continuing cult popularity is mystifying; as teen movies go, this is a long way off, say, <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i> or <i>Pretty in Pink</i>. Hughes: stay behind for detention afterwards. And write me four sides on why this, uh, sucks.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In 1978 Italy, Red Brigades terrorists abducted and eventually murdered the statesman Aldo Moro, a past prime minister and member of the dominant Christian Democrat party. Marco Bellocchio's terse, speculative revisiting of the shattering incident bunks down with the kidnappers in their Rome apartment. Here, the sole female member of the cell, who initially shares her comrades' feeling of tense triumph, begins to have doubts, which Bellocchio sometimes expresses in disorientingly matter of fact dream sequences. Positing politics as a form of religion and vice versa, the film examines a proletarian revolution where 'everything is permitted' - the source of its eloquent anguish and existential dread.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The ICA has a seasonal gush in its press release, tagging Woody Allens gem of comic kvetching as perfect for anyone whos been in love. But love doesnt fare too well in Allens black-and-white paean to both his city and its inhabitants, who exist in that very particular, hyper-neurotic patch between the media and academia that the director has mined so adroitly in movies from Annie Hall to Husbands and Wives. Here, Allen himself is Isaac, a television writer thinking of making the leap to proper literature, whose 17-year-old girlfriend Tracy (Mariel Hemingway) appears positively adult in his shadow. Meanwhile, Isaacs friend, Yale (Michael Murphy) is doing the dirty on his wife with feminist iconoclast Mary (Diane Keaton), a woman who waxes about the Academy of the Overrated (Van Gogh, Bergman, Mahler, Mailer) and makes such effortless declarations as, My problem is that Im both attracted and repelled by the male organ. When Yale decides to end things with Mary, Isaac steps into the vacuum, leaving plenty of room for him to worry about his dying relationship with Tracy and the impending publication of a memoir by his ex-wife-turned-lesbian, Jill (Meryl Streep).<br />As ever, Allen has Bergman on the brain (his character even calls him the only living genius in cinema), but here he crafts a successful marriage between his own brand of self-aware comedy, a Bergman-esque concern for the pain of relationships, the elegiac music of Gershwin and Gordon Willis monumental photography of the city. Amid the blinkered and selfish behaviour of Isaac and his cronies, its Tracy who wins the moral crown but everyone else who gets the good lines.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A reminder that, once upon a time, Spielberg used to make films for adults rather than infants and critical regressives. Maybe it is just a monster movie reminiscent of all those '50s sci-fi films, but it's at least endowed with intelligent characterisation, a lack of sentimentality (in contrast to, say, <i>E.T.</i>), and it really is frightening. And, added to the Ahab/Moby Dick echoes in the grizzled sailor Shaw's obsession with the Great White Shark, there are moments of true darkness, expressed most eloquently in the John Milius-scripted speech about the wreck of the 'Indianapolis'.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Jaws</i> with claws. Now, however, with state-of-the-art computer-generated effects, the creatures are so good you hardly care what the rest of the film is like. Unfortunately, Spielberg seems to share the disinterest. The premise is solid - scientist clones dinosaurs from blood found in insects trapped in amber, invites distinguished guest and children to his living theme park, and watches helplessly as the behemoths run amok - but the plot is full of inconsistencies and shipwrecks from Michael Crichton's novel. The performances are merely passable (save the kids and Dern), and Goldblum is ludicrous as the chaos theorist. His cod mottos are all that's left of the ethical debate, and the only discernible theme is pure Spielberg: palaeontologist Neill starts off hating children but learns to love them. But why quibble? Spielberg is still supreme as an action director, and when the T Rex makes beefburger of the jeep, or the vicious 'Raptors stalk their human prey, the film inspires wonder and awe.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Originally released in 1934, Jean Vigos first and only full-length feature is one of the cinemas greatest masterpieces. The story is very simple: newly-weds Jean Dast and Dita Parlo find living on a cramped Seine barge brings tension to their relationship; their naivety falls prey to the volatile eccentricity of bosum Pre Jules, the temptations of a flirtatious pedlar, and their own unreadiness to compromise. But to this stark narrative Vigo brings a rich array of moods (comic, suspenseful, heart-rendingly romantic) to explore the nuances of every single emotion. <br />Made on a tiny budget, the film exudes an invigorating rawness, but the lyricism of Boris Kaufmans camerawork, the childlike wonder of the performances and the moments of genuine surrealism situate it, poetically, between objective realism and subjective fantasy. The great Michel Simons bestial Jules brings magic and bizarre comedy into the brew as he dithers between jealousy and a desire that his life on the boat should continue uninterrupted, while Dast and Parlo reveal an achingly vulnerable intensity in their chastely erotic scenes together. The direction, acting, script, music (by Maurice Jaubert) and photography  which includes startlingly beautiful special effects  merge to create the loveliest, least maudlin study of human desire ever committed to film; in less than 90 minutes it covers more ground than most directors entire filmographies.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Samira Makhmalbaf casts a look at the plight of women in post-Taliban Afghanistan and the result is as bold, visually striking and uneven as one might expect. Centred on a teenage schoolgirl who dreams of becoming president of her country, notwithstanding the widespread resistance among men and older women to the idea of female education, freedom and power, the film assembles a series of tableaux (as opposed to a fully worked-through story) to explore the theme of bravery and determination in conflict with poverty, ignorance, intolerance and sheer confusion. A charming (if poorly located) comedy sequence with a French soldier is perhaps an index of both the film's funding and its target audience; the darker scenes give the impression of being more heartfelt, though some are awkwardly handled.]]></review>

Outwardly it appears to be an accurate picture; and yet nothing is real. The teachers, their idiosyncrasies appropriately magnified, are seen through the eyes of their pupils. The boys' revolt against mindless discipline culminates in a surreal battle in the playground on speech day. Thirty years later, Lindsay Anderson re-used the same symbols in his own attack on the Establishment, <i>If....</i>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Characteristically Kubrick in both its mechanistic coldness and its vision of human endeavour undone by greed and deceit, this <i>noir</i>-ish heist movie is nevertheless far more satisfying than most of his later work, due both to a lack of bombastic pretensions and to the style fitting the subject matter. Hayden is his usual admirable self as the ex-con who gathers together a gallery of small-timers to rob a race-track; for once it's not the robbery itself that goes wrong, but the aftermath. What is remarkable about the movie, besides the excellent performances of an archetypal <i>noir </i>cast and Lucien Ballard's steely photography, is the time structure, employing a complex series of flashbacks both to introduce and explain characters and to create a synchronous view of simultaneous events. Kubrick's essentially heartless, beady-eyed observation of human foibles lacks the dimension of the genre's classics, but the likes of Windsor, Carey and Cook more than compensate. (From the novel <i>Clean Break</i> by Lional White.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Barefoot black butler can't decide whether he's a Pearl Bailey or Paul Robeson. Father of the family has a teenage son by a heterosexual fling, and 'mother' is a drag star. Between them they make John Inman look like Richard Harris. But the son wants to marry the daughter of a morality campaigner, and the in-laws must meet... High camp and farce are acquired tastes, but even those who usually resist should find amusement in the last act's mounting hysteria. Although theatrical, it remains very funny, and uses the overt stereotyping with great sympathy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Based on a series of American childrens books by Jeff Kinney, this classroom comedy uses a to-camera commentary and Kinneys cartoon sketches to tell the tale of a self-centred kid who is so intent on being middle schools most popular pupil that hes forgotten how to be himself. If Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) were less analytical and more easy-going like his chubby chum Rowley Jefferson (Robert Capron), perhaps he wouldnt get on everyones wick, including ours. Thats the problem: Gordons character is so unpleasant that youre itching for someone to punch him. Had he  and everyone else  been a bit more likeable, we might have overlooked the fact that the film is an empty vessel: a dull, scattershot series of observational sketches that arent funny or enlightening. Granted, many ten year olds will identify with Gregs situation. The question is whether theyll stay awake to see the film through to its limp end.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Another impressive lob out of Argentina, this gleaming, tricksy thriller is pure accomplished entertainment with a sting in its tail worthy of <i>The Usual Suspects</i> - equal parts brilliant and ridiculous. Juan (Pauls) and Marcos (Darn) are a 'student and master' con-artist couple, paired for a day when the opportunity of a lifetime lands in their laps: the chance to flog a forged sheet of rare stamps (the Nine Queens) to a rich tycoon collector who's about to be deported. But can they trust each other or anyone else? First-time director Bielinsky snaps through this Mamet-like construct with justified confidence: the plot twists are sharp, the pacing sprightly (meaning fast subtitles at times), and the two leads completely convincing. And the ending, which suggests you can beat 'em if you join 'em, also contrives to redeem the rest of the film's amoral gusto. Crafty.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Time to click your fingers, dig out your best denim and act like a tough guy on street corners. No, its not a New Kids on the Block reunion but a rerelease of West Side Story. So how does the film  which won ten Oscars on its 1961 release  stand up now? Very well indeed. Old-fashioned song-and-dance routines set to Leonard Bernsteins music apart, theres something thoroughly modern about the whole affair  a mood set by the gliding opening aerial shots of New York City that embrace key landmarks before finding the mean streets, moody subway lines and dingy bars of Lower Manhattan. Theres a turf war going on down there, a battle between the all-American Jets, led by Riff (Russ Tamblyn), and the Sharks, a local band of Puerto Ricans (played largely by made-up white boys). The core of the story is a loose update of the classic Romeo and Juliet tangle, with Jet Tony (Richard Beymer) and Shark chick Maria (a stunning Natalie Wood) falling head over heels and sparking fireworks between their respective camps.Largely its simple, rousing stuff, but the debate among the Puerto Ricans about the attraction and repulsion of the American dream, as caught in the song America, remains current. The film divides opinion by sex: the forward-looking girls see the potential benefits (industry boom in America!) while the nostalgic boys resent their new homes hardships (12 in a room in America!). Theres also a still-relevant, cheeky dig at social theory in the hoodlums chirping naturally were punks and this boy dont need a judge, he needs an analysts care. These days, wed slap an ASBO on the lot of them.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A real 'winds of change' film, with traditional values crumbling in the heat of pre-revolutionary Cuba. Guinness is wonderful. Discovering an unexpected ability to recognise the real in the game of make-believe, he emerges as master of the situation through the boldness of his fantasies. This mad world, where fictional characters die real deaths and even the Clean-Easy man can't be trusted, has little in common with Le Carr's Circus, but as Guinness' vacuum-cleaner salesman/spy sheds his innocence, he becomes dimly recognisable as an early incarnation of mole-catcher Smiley. Graham Greene's 'entertainment' is only gently macabre and the threats never quite materialise, but the film cleverly captures the confusion of optimism, cynicism and money-grubbing greed of the 'never had it so good' years.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An intense, troubling, engrossing documentary from the streets of Rio de Janeiro, pieced together from TV news footage and interviews, about the hijacking of a downtown bus by one of the city's drug-dependent street kids, on 12 June 2000. Sandro do Nascimento had been living rough since the age of six, when he'd seen his mother stabbed before his eyes. Later, he survived the horrors of Brazil's jails and the butchering of his friends at the hands of the police. Now breaking news on all Brazil's TV stations, he tries to parlay a gun and a handful of innocent lives into some kind of settlement. Slightly overlong for overseas audiences, Jos Padilha's film (co-directed by editor Felipe Lacerda) makes it crystal clear why this incident proved so traumatic for many Brazilians.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This tale of an unemployed crane driver is a potent and moving depiction of contemporary survival. If it's specific to Argentinian society, it's also a general take on maintaining hope in the face of various forms of despair. Avoiding crude oppositions, it's a subtle and reasoned response to an unfortunately everyday occurrence, invested with real humanity. With its luminous monochrome camerawork reminiscent in places of the still photography of the great Brazilian Salgado, it's also equally committed to a truthful depiction of labour and its changing nature. It joins a select few films made recently that have successfully played personal dramas off against the huge forces of international capital and consequent social upheaval.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A war film is a war film is a war film... except that Siegel, brought into the project at the last moment when Steve McQueen refused to work with the scheduled director, toughened the standard war-is-hell screenplay into an extraordinary study of psychopathology. He centres everything squarely on the McQueen character (one of his best performances, a human war machine), and emphasises the tensions within the American platoon rather than the conflict with the offscreen Germans. The ending, which stresses the enormous human cost of a small tactical gain, is remarkably powerful, precisely because it's the first time that Siegel allows his audience any perspective on what they've been seeing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Roeg's hugely ambitious and imaginative film transforms a straightforward science fiction story (novel, Walter Tevis) into a rich kaleidoscope of contemporary America. Newton (Bowie), an alien whose understanding of the world comes from monitoring TV stations, arrives on earth, builds the largest corporate empire in the States to further his mission, but becomes increasingly frustrated by human emotions. What follows is as much a love story as sci-fi: like other films of Roeg's, this explores private and public behaviour. Newton/Bowie becomes involved in an almost pulp-like romance with Candy Clark, played out to the hits of middle America, that culminates with his 'fall' from innocence. Roeg, often using a dazzling technical skill, jettisons narrative in favour of thematic juxtapositions, working best when exploring the clichs of social and cultural ritual.

      <review><![CDATA[Keaton's third feature under his own steam is an incredible technical accomplishment, but also an almost Pirandellian exploration of the nature of cinematic reality. Buster plays a cinema projectionist, framed for theft by a jealous rival for his girl's hand, who daydreams himself into life as a daring detective. In an unforgettable sequence, Buster (actually fallen asleep beside the projector) forces his way onto the screen and into the movie he is projecting, only to find himself beset by perils and predicaments as the action around him changes in rapid montage. The sequence is not just a gag, but an astonishingly acute perception of the interaction between movie reality and audience fantasy, and the role of editing in juggling both. The timing here is incredible (a technical marvel, in fact); even more so in the great chase sequence, an veritable cascade of unbelievably complex gags (like the moment when Buster, on the handlebars of a riderless, runaway motor-bike passing some ditch-digging roadworks, receives a spadeful of earth in the face from each oblivious navvy in turn). It leaves Chaplin standing.]]></review>

Thunderously patriotic (the navy is wonderful) and sentimental (kids are wonderful), it's heavily dependent on Kelly's charm and Sinatra's supposed little-boy appeal, the combination of which fuels the running gags and almost saves the scenes with Grayson. The best item is Kelly's dance with Jerry, of 'Tom and Jerry'; otherwise, in a so-so score, Kelly has his first number with a child, and Sinatra sings 'I Fall in Love Too Easily' like he means it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[That Besson previously assisted on a couple of features by the anarcho-eccentric Claude Faraldo is significant: the grim, wordless, post-holocaust humour of <i>The Last Battle</i> bears more than a passing resemblance to the latter's devastating <i>Themroc</i>. Unlike most <i>Mad Max</i> spin-offs, this is much more than a transplanted Western, with a hero who's as often required to be tender as he is ferocious. The result is a neat, wry, pocket-size adventure with several magic moments such as a rain-storm of fresh fish, and a touching scene where two of the most human characters manage to exchange a fragment or two of speech with the aid of a gas inhaler. The monochrome photography enhances a bare-bones atmosphere, and the small cast is splendid. A welcome addition to the post-holocaust barbarism boom.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[You wonder, early in this enchanting film about Chet Baker, whether Bruce Weber is really going to nail this 57-year-old lost jazz legend who has the lines of a tragic life engraved forever in his face. Is Weber  famous for his fashion photography  going to bury Chet in beautiful images? But slowly, surely this composite portrait of Chet then and now (or in 1987, when Weber shot the film) reveals its own depths. Alongside archive material and new footage of Chet shot in his signature romantic, B&amp;W style, Weber elicits frank reminiscences from his subject and a host of ex-lovers and friends.<br /><br />He surprises, too, with his frank questioning. Did he disappoint you as <br />a son? Weber asks Chets mother, his lyrical voice softening the blow. Later he asks Chet: Whats your favourite high? All credit to Weber that Chet throws him a straight answer. Speedballs. The most moving moment is when Weber asks Chet if he had a good time making the film. You sense in the question that its been a tough ride. You sense in the answer that he genuinely enjoyed the company of Weber and the reflection required of making the film.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Damn and blast the bleeding boring old real world with its prejudices and its sadness and its violence and its dreary old clothes... Neil Jordans latest is the wild and wilfully fictional memoir of an introspective, romantic tranvestite who calls himself Kitten (Cillian Murphy). Sweeping us from Ireland to London, from rural backwater to the big smoke, Jordan presents this fast-flowing autobiography of a cross-dressing Dick Whittington in brief chapters that speed easily past the eye and are bolstered by a terrific soundtrack that skips from Cole Porter to T.Rex to Slade to The Wombling Song. Its breathless stuff  a whirlwind of colour, wit and imagination that is driven by a tender, nuanced central performance of charisma, wit and intelligence from Cillian Murphy.<br />Abandoned at birth in late 50s smalltown Ireland, Kitten  real name Patrick  loves to dress in womens clothes and flounce about the house as a girl, much to the obvious dismay of his foster family. He barely cares what anyone else thinks and employs his own internal monologue of random thoughts and crazy dreams as a wall between him and the silly, serious world about him, with its IRA bombs, guns and murders. Hes a bizarre, intoxicating creation and, in turns, a very seductive narrator.<br />His childhood over, Kitten is soon on the road with a touring glam-rock band, playing Bonnie to the lead-singers Clyde and appearing onstage in local community centres, in full drag, as the squaw to his new lovers chief. Always on the move, he crosses the Irish Sea in search of his mother and  once in London  encounters a panto cast of characters. Theres the man (Brendan Gleeson) who dresses up as Womble Uncle Bulgaria to entertain kids; a suave would-be murderer (Bryan Ferry) who lurks in a Jag on a dark side-street and tries to strangle Kitten with a silk neck-tie; a lonely hang-dog magician (Stephen Rea) who falls head-over-heels for him; and a policeman (Ian Hart) who accuses him of terrorism but later delivers him to the relative safe-house of a Soho peep-show parlour.<br />Is any of this real? Is it hell? And what a very dull question, Kitten might add. Breakfast on Pluto is a delightful fairytale that uses the very real world and its hardships  a long-lost mother, terrorism, abuse  as the theatre for much camp playfulness and wish-fulfilment. Jordan  drawing on Patrick McCabes novel  gives us a memoir so eventful, so rapid, so brimming over with flights of fancy that we are entranced by Kitten. Everything  and everyone  else is peripheral. Surprisingly  and much to the credit of both Jordan and Murphy  Kitten emerges as more than a fascinating caricature. Hes a splash of vibrant colour within a monochrome world, an antidote to (and reflection on) the Catholicism and conservatism of 60s and 70s Ireland and, on a more personal level, a credible reaction to his own abandonment and search for identity. The films interests in cross-dressing, performance, the sex industry, our capitals back alleys, the Troubles, messy childhoods and the journey from Ireland to London will be familiar to those who know Mona Lisa, The Butcher Boy, The Crying Game and other Jordan films. Breakfast on Pluto is a wild, imaginative and daring project that could equally be dismissed as chaotic and indulgent or as wild, imaginative and daring. Id say its all these things  and its a hell of a ride for it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This Australian Outback drama about past tragedies and buried secrets in one family relies on so many flashbacks that you end feeling as if youre flipping between two films. Its a device that kills much of the emotional kick of a familiar, if not uninteresting, story of a prodigal son and difficult father that rises above the norm with some bold ideas about brother-sister relations, strong acting and lyrical photography.<br />In the present, troubled middle-aged writer Ned (Ben Mendelsohn) arrives back at his familys farm after his sister Sally (Rachel Griffiths) tells him that his father, Bruce (Bryan Brown), is dying and she needs his help to care for this unhappy mans man who brought up his kids with a rod of iron. When he arrives, Ned has a new girlfriend, Toni (Maeve Dermody), in tow, who we realise is one of a long line of girls with whom Ned has failed to build a future. Its when Ned decides to pen some memoirs  another awkward device  that we learn more about his relationship with his sister Kate (Sophie Lowe), who, like his older brother Cliff (Josh McFarlane) died many years ago in odd circumstances.<br />The first feature to be written and directed by British actress Rachel Ward, Beautiful Kate has many strengths. Its ample hazy flashbacks and landscape shots look ravishing, but the more we learn about this family, the less interesting they become, and the need to tie up loose ends with unconvincing plot details neuters much of the films mystery by the end.]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[The Expendables]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[For all those hoping that Sylvester Stallones much-touted The Expendables would be a sardonic, fourth-wall shattering action spectacular that toyed affectionately with the meat-headed conventions of such retrograde 1980s artefacts as Cobra, Rambo and Commando, well, dont break out the foam-dome and Whitesnake records just yet<br />If ever a test case were required to prove the theory that shit in quote marks is still shit, this is it. The Expendables is a sluggish, derivative, witless farrago which is laser-targeted to the nostalgia set and would surely have gone straight to DVD were it not for Stallones recent run at the box office with belated sequels to his Rocky and Rambo franchises.<br />The Expendables is  once again  about ageing fighters who remain happily out of sync with the modern world, though its more Wild Hogs than No Country For Old Men, concerned less with growing old gracefully than with clinging to a state of perpetual adolescence in which fast cars, tattoos and knifes all remain indescribably cool. Sly is Barney Ross, the stogie-chomping front man to a ragtag, cosily diverse unit of jaded, muscle-bound mercenaries who accept jobs that no-one else in their right mind would touch. Stallone has lost much of the loveable-lug lustre of his early years and seems to have turned into his own Spitting Image puppet, spending the entire film looking like hes watching a fly perched on the end of his nose. <br />We open on the gang dealing with a fleet of Somalian pirates, revealing that  unsurprisingly  diplomacy is not a term in their lexicon. Before you can say, Hey, whats Dolph Lundgren doing with that 12-gauge?, a hostage-taker has been shot through the torso and the whole vessel is submerged in gunfire. And so the depressingly reactionary tone is set, offering the first hint that the title of the film refers as much to the groups view of other human beings as it does to themselves. <br />Settling for the most rudimentary of save-the-maiden/topple-the-dicator plotlines and wheeling out tough-guy clichs by rote, innovation and skill are notable by their absence. And as if things werent bad enough, Stallone mysteriously opts to photograph the entire film in extreme close-up, which a) allows you to see just how shallow all the characters are, b) alerts you to the shoddiness of the effects, and c) means that all the action scenes look like an indiscriminate tangle of bloody body parts. <br />Elsewhere, pickings remain slim. Cameo appearances by Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger serve no function whatsoever bar allowing Stallone to make a cheap allusion to Arnies day job (a Planet Hollywood gag wouldve been funnier), while the inclusion of a romantic sub-plot exists solely to allow Jason Statham to furnish retributive justice on the local wife-beater. Theres even a fight scene inspired by a racial stereotype, as Jet Li engages in a warehouse tussle with Lundgren and gains the advantage because hes so short.<br />Even if Slys sense of irony hadnt been lost in the mail, The Expendables would still be unsalvageable. Its a film that exists in a cultural limbo, where life, history and filmmaking appear to have ceased at the moment Ronald Reagan left office. Still, if you like watching men with no necks thumping each other, this could be your Citizen Kane.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Welcome to the land of heartbreak and tractors, says a 55-year-old Turkmen musician (Khajeh Araz Dordi) in Iranian-born writer-director and London Film School alumnus Babak Jalalis low-key feature debut. Jalalis film traces days in the life of a quartet of longing, waiting and remembering men living half-paced lives in the northern Iranian steppes. Slow-witted Hassan (Abolfazl Karimi) feeds his faithful donkey newsprint and listens to Franoise Hardy on his cassette player; his uncle Kazem spends a lot of time selling nothing in a clothes shop; Alam dreams of escape as he teaches himself English on his shifts at a farm; The Minstrel  has anybody died, yet?  waits for funerals as a Tehran photographer snaps clichd portraits of him for a magazine. Leaning to the droll side of comic, Jalali matches his pacing and tone to the hazy languor of an inconsequential midsummer, using a likeable non-pro cast, alternating travelling and formalised camera positions and the muted chords of composer Noaz Deshe. As a portrait of a land of unfulfilled promise, this is emotionally contained, a little limited but sympathetically observant and seductively shot.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[American critics have taken this new big-screen version of the iconic 80s TV series to task, claiming its dumb, loud and painfully superficial.<br /><br />All three criticisms are wholly appropriate. But what in hell were they expecting? For audiences willing to switch their brain into disbelief-suspension mode, The A-Team is just as dumb, loud and superficial as it needs to be.<br />Its basically an origin story, as our four outlaw heroes meet in a hail of bullets on an undercover mission in the Mexican desert before being posted to Iraq and framed for treason. Eyebrows were raised when Liam Neeson agreed to pick up George Peppards stogie-chewing mantle as Captain Hannibal Smith, but he just about maintains his dignity, forming a solid core of thespian gravitas for his wisecracking sidemen Face (Bradley Cooper) and Murdock (Sharlto Copley) to run circles around. <br />Director Joe Carnahan (Narc, Smokin Aces) marshals proceedings with a thunderous and gleeful absence of subtlety: zip-pans, smash edits and MTV-style freeze-frames abound, and many of the action scenes are so jerky and cluttered that its hard to know whats going on. But when those same sequences involve looping-the-loop helicopters, avalanches of shipping crates and tanks plummeting from burning aeroplanes, perhaps its for the best.<br />So, of course, the plot could be tighter, the script less clich ridden, the action clearer and the performances not so broad. But as an unfussy, streamlined example of old-school Hollywood summer cinema at its purest and most unpretentious, The A-Team scores at least a B.]]></review>

No improbable stone is left unturned as the convoluted 60s-style spy caper unfolds to present a tale of conflict between two of mankinds most popular pets. On one side we have the secret, ultra-hi-tech organisation, Dogs HQ, and on the other, the terrifying spectre of a bald pussy with plans to take over the world. You do wonder how this odious enterprise ever got the green light: the script suggests it was developed on the hoof; the CGI is low grade stuff; and the human performances are loathsome. Worst of all, its not even funny. Very paw.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Street-dancing films should come with their own rating category: not suitable for over-15s. This one, number three in the franchise, is filmed like a deodorant ad  with the same nuances of character and story. It follows Moose (Adam G Sevani), a dancer who arrives in New York to start university after promising his parents to hang up his Nikes. Instead he falls in with a crew that needs to win the $100,000 prize in a dance-off championship to keep their studio open.<br />The 3D format has found a playmate in dance. The skills of the dancers  most are acting for the first time (it shows)  are exhilarating. If only there were more drop kicks and fewer banal lines. No clich is left unearthed: Weve become like a pseudo family, says the crew leader  in case you missed the bunk-beds. An 18-year-old dancer, Sevani as Moose lightens the load; a natural, hes sweet and funny, and gives what should be a breakout performance if any grown-ups are watching.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[If M Night Shyamalans po-faced fantasy epic were half as much fun as its ridiculous title suggests, it might have been possible to salvage a smidgen of entertainment from it. Instead, one is bored and stupefied by what seems like an eternity of vacuous spectacle, cod-Buddhist tosh and clunking dialogue. Even more embarrassing than the risible Lady in the Water, this wildly misjudged farrago is portentous but never profound, laughable but not remotely funny and action-packed without ever being exciting  all in fuzzy, retro-fitted 3D. <br />Having been awol for 100 years  during which time the world was thrown out of balance (yawn) and the bellicose Fire Nation conquered the peaceful Southern Water Tribe with their fearsome war machines  the shaven-headed Aang (Noah Ringer) is released from a sphere of ice by two Water Tribe children, Katara (Nicola Peltz) and her older brother Sokka (Jackson Rathbone). It looks like Aang may be the mythical Avatar, the only being who can control all four elements: Earth, Fire, Water and Air. Various interested parties, including the Fire Nations vengeful, exiled Prince Zuko (Dev Patel), are determined to harness or suppress the Avatars powers. <br />A series of confusing adventures, explosive battles and vaguely spiritual confrontations follows, while giant furry creatures float in the air, talking dragon spirits offer sage advice, and the moon turns red with shame. Devotees of the original Nickleodeon animated TV series swear this film adaptation is a travesty of its meaningful, allegorical themes  but most of them were aged between six and 12 when they first saw it. Either way, if your actual or mental age exceeds this, steer well clear.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[If ever, God forbid, Welsh psych-pop doyens Super Furry Animals decided to pack up their fuzz pedals, their acerbic, softly spoken frontman, Gruff Rhys, would make a great alternative to Alan Whicker or Michael Palin  at least on the evidence of this sweetly ramshackle travelogue. Separado! follows Rhys as he tours one of his Welsh-language solo albums around Patagonia, intent on uncovering his roots and tracking down Welsh-gaucho troubadour Ren Griffiths. It mixes historical recreation, live performance, family background and special linking shots with Gruff dressed as a teleporting Power Ranger. The film ends up being a gentle and entertaining study of a man trying to make sense of how people remain connected to their birthplace. Beware, though, of one or two moments when the makers have gone off-message in the edit, notably during a lengthy diversion in which a Welsh girl band are allowed a big song-and-dance number on a cliff top.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For classical buffs, the presence in this documentary of pianists such as Alfred Brendel, Pierre-Laurent Aimard and Lang Lang probably constitutes recommendation enough. Yet this Austrian offering is too intriguing and entertaining to be left to the specialists. True, a full 90-odd minutes following a top Vienna piano technician may sound somewhat academic, but documentaries are about people and the camera loves Stephan Knpfer, a keyboard obsessive whose pixie-ish sense of humour allows him to see the absurdity in his work  probably why he helps out with a piano-mangling comedy duo for light relief. Elsewhere, its surprisingly compelling to watch this master of his craft at work under the hood, as he struggles to prepare for Aimards first Bach recording. We also learn to listen, since the soundtrack captures every last reverberation of the notes tapering into nothingness. Such is the madness of perfection in a captivating film not just for pianomaniacs.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Close Encounters</i> takes the favoured dream of every UFO enthusiast (that the US government has been operating a cover-up) and turns it into a majestic and finally unprecedented adventure story. As early references to <i>The Ten Commandments</i> and Chuck Jones's Warner cartoons show, the film seems less concerned with science fiction than with recapturing the wonder of a child's first experience of the cinema, and the surprising thing is that Spielberg moves into this territory so effectively. There are some awkward touches (Truffaut never ceases to be Truffaut, while some of the comedy scenes are a little overplayed), but they're small price to pay for the first film in years to give its audiences a tingle of shocked emotion that is not entirely based either on fear or on suspense.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Forster, director of the impressively handled Monsters Ball, applies an equally sensitive touch to this story of the affair between JM Barrie (the playwright of Peter Pan) and sparkling married mother of five Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet). Trouble is, scurrilous Edwardian minds thought the affair had more to do with Barries interest in Daviess lovely children; a matter Allan Knee and David Magees script alludes too but deems beside the point. The point this film attempts to express is more about transcendence; not only how the childrens imaginations act as Barries artistic muse and help him come to terms with the early death of his beloved older brother, but also how the childlike Barrie, in providing chaste consolation for the grieving Sylvia, dignifies the value of the non-sexual side of caring relationships.<br />Its a difficult trick to pull off, not least within the confines of the conventional quality drama, and if the film is partially successful, it is in no small measure due to overall good performances. Dustin Hoffmans producer Charles Frohman, Julie Christie as Sylvias frosty mother and the young Freddie Highmore as the sensitive Peter Davies deserve mention alongside an unhistrionic Winslet as terminally ill Sylvia and Depps beautifully judged innocent. Forsters feel for Edwardian London, with its echoes of Topsy-Turvy-esque theatreland, can tend to the derivative, but he handles well, notably in the garden play scenes and the effect-generated fusion of fantasy and reality. But the whole is infused by an awkward decorum; the kind that descends on a gathering dominated by an unmentioned death or transgression.

      <review><![CDATA[Jacques Audiard (A Self-Made Hero, Read My Lips) translates to modern-day Paris the dilemmas of James Tobacks 1978, New York-set Fingers  the story of a young man caught between art and crime, between his own ambitions and those of his father  in an audacious move that reverses the old chestnut that you should ignore the remake and hunt down the original instead. In place of Harvey Keitels Jimmy Fingers, Audiard gives us 28-year-old Thomas Seyr (Romain Duris), an archetypal slick and streetwise Parisian  always immaculately suited and booted  and a man who is in perpetual conflict with himself as the victim of a dual, contrasting inheritance from his wheeler-dealer father, Thomas (Niels Arestrup) and his late concert-pianist mother, Sonia. When we first encounter Thomas, he is very much his fathers boy  he works as a heavy-handed employee of a dodgy property firm  but a chance encounter with a piano teacher, an old acquaintance of his mother, leads to an offer of an audition and a decision by Thomas to turn his back on the manhandling of wayward tenants and instead prepare himself for a career in music. Thomas hires a Vietnamese piano teacher, Miao Lin (Linh Dan Pham), but his impatience and brash manner mean that he approaches piano lessons as he does real-estate  as a hustler.You gonna make dough from pianos? asks one of Thomass sceptical colleagues. Not pianos. The piano, Thomas snaps back, yet his new ambition never really convinces. Rather, like the ill-defined sexual encounters that Thomas enjoys with his friends wife, the piano is an experiment, a means for Thomas to attempt to redefine his place in the world. Audiards nuanced (and very well-performed, especially by Duris) character study is ultimately about fathers and the shadow they throw over their sons lives. The films opening scene depicts a friend of Thomas analysing his own relationship with his ageing dad (You wake up one morning and youve switched places). In retrospect, it stands as a prologue to Audiards intelligent study of Thomass own life.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Cinema has licked the boots of the Rolling Stones so many times over the years that Scorseses slick new doc about the band, produced by the foursome themselves, struggles to say anything new, especially as the doors remain shut on their off-stage personas. Long gone are the days when Jagger masturbated for Robert Frank in Cocksucker Blues or the band bashed at the piano late at night in an Irish hotel for Peter Whiteheads Charlie is My Darling. <br />Scorsese, too, is no longer a youngster with time on his hands and something to prove. At 66, he is one of the worlds most recognised, respected and busy filmmakers. Crucially, though, he carries with him the kudos from when rock collided with film in the 1970s, when Jumpin Jack Flash introduced De Niros entrance in Mean Streets (1973) and Bob Dylan played for his camera in The Last Waltz (1978). Its that kudos, more than anything else, that Scorsese brings to Shine a Light. Hes a safe pair of hands for a band as aware as ever of their image while appearing not to care about anything so un-rocknroll as public relations.<br />The point being: all Scorsese has to do is switch on the camera, stress the age-old Stones-Scorsese alchemy,let the band play, insert the odd clip from Charlie is My Darling and other docs, and his job is done. This is a superior concert film, no more, no less, blessed with the nod from Scorsese that makes it more than another tour film.<br />Scorsese knows his special place in this act of collusion and so gives himself a role as an equal to the band despite his pretending to be subservient to their crazy whims. We see him stressing about the set-list and standing at the stage-door but all this does is put the spotlight on him even more. And if the Stones can call on guests to join them on stage (Buddy Guy, Jack White, Christina Aguilera), so can he: he hauls in a bunch of heavyweight camera guys to help him film the two-night, smallish gig at New Yorks Beacon Theater that makes up most of this film. They include Robert Elswit, who shot There Will Be Blood, and Emmanuel Lubezki, who works with Terrence Malick. Thankfully, we dont have to watch Scorsese bash bums with Lubezki as Jagger does with Aguilera.<br />What the Stones still do well is play live. The band give it their all, with Mick bouncing and contorting through the gig and Keith proving to be a living one-man finger-up to medicine. But what do we learn? That Micks in charge but not against letting Keith stagger through a solo. That Mick wishes Charlie Watts would dress a bit more rock (he loosens the zip of Watts top as they take a bow). That Mick spends a lot of time at the gym, judging by the stomach he shows off. That Keith looks like a tramp with a brilliant dentist. And that, all in all, these guys can put on a damn good show even if its left to archive and a meet-and-greet with the Clintons to entertain us beyond the music.<br />Lets face it: sexagenarians  even Keith Richards  probably dont do that much after a gig other than sleep. Which doesnt make for great cinema. And so Scorsese has made a wise choice to rely on live gigs and past glories. It doesnt make for anything like his rich Dylan film, No Direction Home, but it allows for a stylish, intimate concert film for fans.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The lies family members tell each other form the basis for many an overheated melodrama, but few as entertainingly OTT as City Island. Andy Garcia plays Vince, a working-class family man who hides his passion for acting from wife Joyce (Julianna Margulies). Their daughter (Dominik Garcia-Lorido) cant admit she strips to pay for college, while son Vince Jr (Ezra Miller, so good in Afterschool) has a furtive passion for chubby women. <br />The movie is a mixed bag: for every keen insight theres a clich, for every quiet character moment a scene of outrageous overacting  Garcia, for instance, lays on the Common Man routine with a trowel. But these flaws dont detract from what is an enjoyable, thoughtful and old fashioned celebration of human flaws and familial foibles. Writer-director Raymond De Felitta  who made a splash last year with excellent jazz doc  Tis Autumn  displays a sure hand, and it all comes together in a wonderfully unrestrained climactic scene of pure melodramatic overkill. Great fun.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This remake of the 1984 weedy-kid-makes-good parable is a fascinating example of how fine the line is between success and failure in films. The story is still great, and in shifting the action to urban China, director Harald Zwart and his writers have refreshed an old set-up. The cast are solid  Jackie Chan makes for an oddly vulnerable Miyagi (now Mr Han)  and the script, though overlong, moves at a crackling pace.<br />But the makers have made one giant misstep, and it sinks the film: in reducing their hero from streetwise teen Daniel-san to gobby 12-year-old Dre (Jaden Smith), theyve completely altered the tone of the piece, changing it from a goofy, uplifting coming-of-age drama into a distressing, queasy tale of bullying and retribution. Everything about Dre feels written for an older actor  his tense relationship with his mum, his awkward courtship of a local girl, and the final battle, in which the sight of crowds cheering a battered pre-teen into bone-crunching combat just feels jaw-droppingly inappropriate. Come back, Ralph Macchio. All  even Karate Kid 3  is forgiven.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Prolific director Priyadarshans latest is a muddled Bollywood attempt at satire on the hardships faced by the common man in order to progress in modern India. Simpleton Sachin (Kumar) struggles to complete various road and gutter construction contracts as he has to give baksheesh at every point. This overlong film portrays the ingenious means one has to employ to survive in a system endemic to bribery and corruption. However, this accurate observation is swamped by unnecessary and unconnected subplots. This includes the obligatory half-baked romance and dispensable ditties with scantily-clad blonde babes. Kumars customary hamming evokes unintentional laughter especially in a flashback sequence where he plays a college student. He throws in one funny joke at real life ex-girlfriend Shilpa Shettys expense!]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[That rare thing: an intelligent, beautifully acted, and gloriously funny British comedy. At the butt-end of the '60s, two 'resting' young thesps - Withnail (Grant, a revelation), a cadaverous upper middle class burning-out case with an acid wit and soleless shoes, and the seemingly innocent unnamed 'I' (McGann) - live on a diet of booze, pills, and fags in their cancerous Camden flat, until a cold comfort Lakeland cottage is offered for their use. For all its '60s arcana, this is no mere semi-autobiographical nostalgia trip, but an affecting and open-eyed rites-of-passage movie. Robinson's debut as writer/director (he scripted <i>The Killing Fields</i>) exhibits the value of the old virtues: characterisation, detail, and engagement. His characters are oddball, degenerate even, but rounded - none more so than the elephantine figure of Griffiths as Withnail's gay uncle Monty. Beautifully scripted, indecent, honest, and truthful, it's a true original.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Brave knight-turned-bounty-hunter Bowen (Quaid) teams up with Draco, an 18 by 43ft last-surviving dragon (voice by Sean Connery). They go from village to village, faking the dragon's capture and pocketing the reward. Thus Bowen is kept in turnips, while Draco escapes extinction. Being a medieval Hollywood romp for the '90s (notable computer-generated effects), the film has a villainous king played by an English actor - here, the wonderful Thewlis, who distracts attention from Quaid's obvious inability to match the technology. When he finds out his mother the Queen (Christie) has tried to have him killed, he pauses before muttering, 'How unmotherly of you.' Engaging fare: part Dungeons and Dragons, part buddy movie - in the style of 'The Good, the Bad and the Very Ugly' - and, finally, a tale of redemption. Connery's dragon doesn't baulk at chatting up the leading lady.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A Hollywood has-been slums it in an amateur British production: its a description that covers both plot and film in this amiable but scattershot comedy. Burt Reynolds is Jefferson Steel, a pampered action star desperate to make a comeback. He accepts an offer to do Shakespeare in Stratford, little knowing that its not upon Avon, but the (fictional) village of Stratford St John in Suffolk. <br />Naturally, the amateur theatre group is in raptures about the arrival of their LA King Lear, but the man himself is less than enthused about acting alongside pig farmers and staying in a B&amp;B with no ensuite facilities. Its a reasonably amusing idea, and the script duly has fun with the contrasts between LA-la land and sleepy Suffolk. Steel pops his shoes outside his bedroom door only for a dog to chew on them. Later, the local mobile library is hurriedly transformed into a makeshift trailer. <br />Such antics raise a smile, but no belly laughs. Those are reserved soley for Imelda Staunton, who puts in a jolly performance as the owner of the B&amp;B and Steels biggest fan. Derek Jacobi also acts a bland Reynolds off the screen in a no-brainer role as a Shakesperian purist. But the story is completely preposterous, as anyone with a passing knowledge of Hollywood and agents (ie 'Entourage' viewers) will know. Its also hastily edited and, in places, poorly cast. The talents of Staunton, Jacobi and love interest Samantha Bond aside, the title may be more accurate than originally intended.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Giuseppe Tornatore has spent his career trying to top 1988s Cinema Paradiso, and this mammoth tribute to his Sicilian hometown (Bagheria, or Baara in the local dialect) seems intended as some sort of magnum opus. Sweeping through more than half a century, it traces a social transformation from the near-feudal backwater of the 1920s to a recognisably modern community.<br /><br />The surprise, perhaps, is that its not primarily a Mafia saga, focusing instead on the travails of Peppino (Francesco Scianna), scion of sheep-rearing stock, who gets himself an education, ascends the Communist Party ranks and makes his mark on the local council, where the Christian Democrats  way too cosy with the Cosa Nostra  have long held sway.<br />The thrust of the story is how Peppino always feels like hes a failure because Sicily never seems to be changing when youre in the midst of it  so its for the viewer to grasp the measure of his achievement. While this concentration on the sleeves-rolled-up heroism of an ordinary man is theoretically uplifting, the proceedings get clogged with sundry comic misadventures, too many characters we dont care about, a weak performance by Margareth Mad as the love of Peppinos life, and a surfeit of effortful Morricone strings. Knowing that the entire town was built on huge sets in Tunisia renders the whole edifice an epic act of directorial obsession to rank with Heavens Gate, so its a shame Tornatores movie, impressive statement though it is, never musters the emotional potency that would make it really special.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For a director who dabbled in the avant-garde, Cavalcanti makes surprisingly little of the surreal possibilities of this convoluted Dickensian nightmare. As in <i>Champagne Charlie</i> he collaborated with art director Michel Relph to create an impressively atmospheric Victorian London, but stylish visuals hardly compensate for the flat, cursory rendering of some of Dickens' best drawn characters. Only Bernard Miles as Noggs and Cedric Hardwicke as wicked Uncle Ralph are given enough space to establish a proper presence. Meagre and one-dimensional, the film is finally smothered by Ealing's cosy sentimentality.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The first of a burgeoning series of American film industry attempts to colonise the kung-fu market, this manages to be inferior to even the weakest of Bruce Lee's <i>echt</i>-Chinese movies. A sorry mixture of James Bond and Fu Manchu, it tacks together the exploits of a multi-national crew of martial artists converging on Hong Kong for a tournament, infiltrated by Lee - fresh from his Shaolin temple - on an assignment to bust an opium racket. Worth seeing for Lee, but still unforgivably wasteful of his talents.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA['What am I working on? I'm working on something that will change the world and human life as we know it!' So Seth Brundle (Goldblum) promises in the opening line of Cronenberg's inspired remake. Sure, he wants to get science reporter Davis into bed, but he means it too. Not that Cronenberg evinces any interest in teleportation - Brundle's hokey invention. Nor does he hang his scientist for Frankensteinian hubris. Rather, this is a film about fusion. That of man and insect, of course; but also the emotional and physical fusion between man and woman - liberating and painful as that may be. The playful, quirky chemistry between Goldblum and Davis in the first half of the movie ensures that this gothic horror is heartbreaking as well as stomach-churning (the special effects by Chris Walas are still staggering, 16 years on).]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Horton Foote adapted his play <i>The Traveling Lady</i> for this vaguely literary tale of small town Texas folk, one of the string of well-meaning but amorphous pictures (<i>To Kill A Mockingbird</i> was the best) turned out by Mulligan and producing partner Alan Pakula throughout the '60s. McQueen is slightly ill-at-ease as a rebellious rockabilly singer trying to stay on the right side of the law after his release on parole, lip-synching unconvincingly on the bandstand, and unable to invest his characteristically spare acting style with the psychological insights that would enable the audience to 'read' his self-destructive character. Remick is typically radiant in a typically thankless role as the doormat wife. The impressive high-contrast b/w camerawork is by Ernest Laszlo.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A maddening mixture, this adaptation of John Kander's fine musical based on Christopher Isherwood's Berlin stories. Superbly choreographed by Fosse, the cabaret numbers evoke the Berlin of 1931 - city of gaiety and perversion, of champagne and Nazi propaganda - so vividly that only an idiot could fail to perceive that something is rotten in the state of Weimar. Doubling as director, Fosse unfortunately feels the need to put the boot in with some crude cross-cutting (eg from a man being beaten up by Nazis in the street to the leering faces of the cabaret performers) which lands the film in a queasy morass of overstatement.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[If you're still at the age when farting and nose-picking seem funny, then <i>Caddyshack</i> should knock you dead. Buried deep - very deep - beneath the rising tide of effluent is a pleasant enough story of a kind about trying to make it to the top as a caddy while yet remaining human; a movie which could have done for golf what <i>Breaking Away</i> did for cycling. Instead it allows a string of resistible TV comics (Chase excepted) to mug through an atrocious chain of lame-brained set pieces, the least vulgar of which involves a turd in a swimming pool. Going a bit far? Well, then someone eats it. And then someone sits in a pile of vomit. And then...it just gets worse. CPea.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A successful movie director in his 40s, Salvatore returns home to Sicily after hearing of the death of Alfredo, ex-projectionist at the eponymous village cinema. The greater part of Tornatore's film is a flashback to Salvatore's WWII childhood and adolescence when, obsessed by movies, he is befriended by the wise and gruffly benevolent Alfredo (Noiret), the local priest censors kissing scenes, the whole village is wowed by <i>Rome, Open City</i>, a fire caused by nitrate stock blinds Alfredo, and just as Salvatore is shooting his first home movie he falls in love. Warmly nostalgic without (for the most part) falling foul of Felliniesque caricature, the film is too emotionally manipulative for its own good, Noiret's typically professional performance notwithstanding. Alfredo's mystic sagacity is implausible, and the infant Salvatore (Cascio) is too cutely precocious by half. The politics and history, too, are simplified (partly, perhaps, by a 30 minute pruning for export release). But the final montage of censored clips, hoarded by the boy and rediscovered in adult life, is a sweet hymn to the romance of cinema.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Guy Hamiltons Pinewood-produced Goldfinger is the first of four James Bond films he directed and the third to star Sean Connery as 007. Any kid growing up in the early 60s will remember this one for several reasons: Birley Shasseys screamer of a theme; Bonds shocking use of a beautiful girl as a human shield; bullion-obsessed baddie Auric Goldfingers top hat-wielding henchman, Oddjob; Honor Blackmans risquely monikered Pussy Galore; and, above all, Bonds stupendous, gadget-infested silver Aston Martin DB5, the car that spurred a thousand Corgi purchases. Presented here in a newly restored digital print, it should look especially swish on the big screen.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Chaplin acts the roles of Hitler (alias Adenoid Hynkel) and a Jewish barber who returns as an amnesiac, decades after an accident in World War I, totally unaware of the rise of Nazism and the persecution of his people. The representation of Hitler is vaudeville goonery all the way, but minus the acid wit and inventive energy that Groucho Marx managed in his impersonation of authoritarianism gone berserk in <i>Duck Soup</i>. Mr Nobody is eventually carted away to a concentration camp, which leads to a reversal of roles when the barber escapes and is mistaken for Hynkel on the eve of the invasion of Austria. Cue for an impassioned speech about freedom and democracy calculated to jerk tears out of the surliest fascist, in a manner startlingly similar to Hitler's very own delivery.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[How would it feel to wake up to the same day <i>every</i> day? Would you crack up at the sheer tedium of it all? Cynically exploit others (<i>they</i> don't know they're trapped in a time warp) with what you learned about them the day before? Or use the situation to better yourself? That's the dilemma facing misanthropic TV weatherman Phil Connors (Murray) when he once more visits the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania - 'weather capital of the world' - to report on its annual Groundhog Day ceremony. What's so satisfying about Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis' script - besides the sheer plethora of gags - is the way it rigorously covers every last nuance of Connors' nightmarish predicament: he can drink himself legless without fear of the morning after, endlessly refine his chat-up lines, become an expert in 19th century French verse, but whatever he does he ends up back where he was on the dot of six. Ramis directs this surreal suburban fantasy with an admirably light touch, revelling in its absurd repetitions, surprising us with narrative ellipses, and allowing Murray ample space to indulge his special mix of sarcasm and smarm. But this is first and foremost a comedy of <i>ideas</i>, on which score it never falters.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Cukor and Donald Ogden Stewart's evergreen version of Philip Barry's romantic farce, centreing on a socialite wedding threatened by scandal, is a delight from start to finish, with everyone involved working on peak form. Hepburn's the ice maiden, recently divorced from irresponsible millionaire Grant and just about to marry a truly dull but supposedly more considerate type (Howard). Enter Grant, importunate and distinctly sceptical. Also enter Stewart and Hussey, snoopers from <i>Spy</i> magazine, to cover the society wedding of the year and throw another spanner in the works. Superbly directed by Cukor, the film is a marvel of timing and understated performances, effortlessly transcending its stage origins without ever feeling the need to 'open out' in any way. The wit still sparkles; the ambivalent attitude towards the rich and idle is still resonant; and the moments between Stewart and Hepburn, drunk and flirty on the moonlit terrace, tingle with a real, if rarely explicit, eroticism.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Bobby is a struggling black actor. The few roles offered by white movie writers and producers reek of artifice: punks, pimps, sassy soul brothers and Eddie Murphy clones. What's a man to do? Townsend's satire may be gentle, but more often than not it's spot on. As Bobby (Townsend) escapes the sad reality of racial stereotyping through daydreams that expose the absurdity of whites telling blacks how to be Black, we're treated to visions of a Black Acting School (learn how to play a yodelling butler Stepin Fetchit-style), a truly <i>noir</i> TV-<i>noir</i> (Sam Ace in <i>Death of a Breakdancer</i>), and best of all, a Bros' version of a Bazza Norman-type movie round-up. Despite the film's conspicuously minuscule budget and shaky narrative structure, it is funny. If you value enthusiasm and imagination more than glossy sophistication, you'll laugh.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In this engaging Argentinian comedy a motley group of characters - a taxi driver, his ex-girlfriend, a musician and his wife, an air hostess, a dog walker and others - all become acquainted and involved in various addictive fads, pastimes, and get-rich schemes. It's a refreshingly wry study of a society at the crossroads, trying to reinvent itself as it stutters from crisis to crisis, confidence barely dented let alone dashed. Fine performances all round, some very droll sight gags and a laconic but illuminating script make for very enjoyable viewing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The modesty of the title isn't misplaced. Indeed, one of its three intertwined micro narratives is so slight as to be almost negligible. Ironically, it's the one that sprang most immediately from the director's inspiration, a trip through the steppes of Patagonia to film a local television game show. Mara Flores (Bravo) is a young peasant mother, dumbstruck at winning an invitation on to 'Multicoloured Casino', and the promise of a prize multi-processor. Making the same 200-mile journey to San Julin in parallel is Don Justo (Benedictti), former proprietor of the local petrol station, following a tip that his long lost dog is now hanging out there. Our third wayfarer is travelling salesman Roberto (Lombardo), a font of modern improvisation and persuasion techniques who turns out to have as precarious a hold on his self-assurance as any of us. His plan is to escort a surprise birthday cake to the son of a young widowed client. The film has a bashfulness that's right in line with its characters' smalltime, world's-end aura of quiescent ephemerality. Of various light ironies at play, the most redolent is the contrast of character and landscape. In classical Hollywood such photogenic wide plains would confer a grandeur and dynamism, but these folk look humbly stranded.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Washington, DC, 2054: a city without murder for six years, thanks to the Pre-Crime unit's use of evidence foreseen by three psychic Pre-Cogs to track, arrest and lock up the 'killers' just before the act. The unit's chief, Anderton (Cruise), has his own reasons for supporting the scheme and its advocate Burgess (von Sydow) against sceptics like Witwer (Farrell), sent by the Attorney General to see if the nation should adopt the city's policy. But then something makes Anderton think again: during transmission of a stranger's imminent death, he recognises the killer - himself. Can Pre-Cogs be wrong? Hopes were high for Spielberg's film, adapted from a Philip K Dick story and blessed with a top technical crew and hot actors to bolster Tom. The first hour is promising. Despite ostentatious, obfuscating gadgetry, jargon and product placement; it's fairly persuasive as a future-projection. But thereafter ideas are mostly cast aside so that Cruise can run, leap, kick ass and look anxious but determined as clichs multiply around him. The fashionably fussy, funky veneer may convince some that the film's serious, but it's finally another chase pic, murky in detail, muddled in ideology and strangely predictable in dramatic thrust.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Splendid camerawork by Joseph MacDonald, otherwise a three-hour plod through a bestseller by Richard McKenna. Set in China in 1926, it deals with the trials and tribulations of an American gunboat crew who learn to love the natives while trying to save them from their own follies and the depredations of everybody else. Behind its timid criticism of imperialist attitudes, lies a much louder and heartfelt American cry - with China 1926 standing in for Vietnam 1966 - of 'Why doesn't everybody love us when we do our best for you?' To leaven the message, McQueen and Attenborough, as the two most humanitarian members of the crew of a ship run by coolie labour, both get romances: McQueen with Bergen's American mission teacher (hair in tight bun), Attenborough with Andriane's half-caste girl (highly cultured). There are also some well-staged battles.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Animation giant Oshii has made a couple of live-action films before, with undistiguished results, but this is some kind of masterpiece. Shot in Poland (in Polish!), it envisages a society in which a virtual-reality war game called Avalon is an illegal, underworld cult. Woman player Ash feels ready to leave team-play behind and go solo in Class A; the one blemish in her record is a game she is rumoured to have aborted by calling 'Reset' - a game which prompted team leader Murphy to go solo and end up apparently brain dead in hospital. Oshii presents her quest to triumph in Class A (and the two astonishing levels that lie beyond it) as a dissection of will and identity considerably more challenging than anything Cronenberg managed in eXistenZ. Using tinted monochrome images (only close-ups of food and the deceptive environment of Class Real are in full colour), elements of Arthurian myth, memories of Eastern Bloc war movies and CG effects of staggering sophistication, this plays like The Matrix re-imagined by Jan Svankmajer.]]></review>

Much obvious 'significance' (the pair playing chess; symbolic, see?), much glossy imagery (courtesy of Haskell Wexler) fashionably fragmented into interminable split-screen nonsense, and little of any real interest. The whole thing is as irritatingly meaningless as its Oscar-winning song, 'Windmills of My Mind'; a sad product of its times.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Charmingly bitter-sweet tale of the carefree jazz musician and the romantic shop-girl he gets pregnant, leading her to a back-street abortionist as a preferable alternative to facing her strict Italo-American family. Familiar in theme, but given a delightfully fresh flavour by Mulligan's  atmospherically low-key direction, excellent performances from Wood and McQueen, and vivid location shooting in New York's Little Italy (the musician's union hall at the beginning, the amusement park, the sad and shabby street of the abortionist). Edie Adams is outstanding as the quizzically cynical stripper with whom McQueen is shacked up, but who is given a characteristically raw deal by a script working its way toward the obligatory happy ending.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its been a long time since a comedy had me fearing for the seat I was sitting on, but watching a rabid assortment of soap-jawed marionettes solemnly swear, spew, and besmirch the civilised world under the bomb(t)astic rubrick of the Bush administrations war on terror, I really got the willies. I understand this ranks me as a reactionary running-dog and impressionable delinquent  but at least I kept the chair clean. <br />The missing  and debatably sarcastic  link between Washingtons special-ops ideal and Gerry Andersons prelapsarian Thunderbirds, Team America are a cracked terrorist-fighting task force whose defiance of WMD-toting mullahs tends to leave the likes of Paris and the Pyramids wasted anyway. Trey Parker and his South Park accomplice Matt Stone sift through this ostensible contradiction in the accompanying rock anthem America: Fuck Yeah! <br />More candid than the sniggering schoolboy politics is Parkers justifiable pride in how his painstaking (and often painstakingly crude) puppetry shows up the human performers in live-action Jerry Bruckheimer-style jingoist extravaganzas, as elaborated in the serenade I Miss You (And Pearl Harbor Sucked). Team America recruit a Broadway heartthrob to infiltrate the evil-doers, and discover a fifth column of hand-wringing Hollywood liberals in league with North Koreas crazed leader Kim Jong II. <br />Better sustained than the South Park movie, Team America delivers both spot-on movie deconstruction and gleeful destruction. It also teaches that there are different levels of piss-taking. The film might send up American war-mongers cartoonish world-view  a world of dicks, pussies and assholes  but the jokes still on the pussies.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A decidedly droll, subdued comedy from the Uruguayan duo behind 25 Watts, whose slacker comedy here jumps a generation to permeate the story of a greying trio of sock-makers. Jacobo (Andres Pazos) is a gruff, downcast bachelor whose daily routine is as mechanical as the small-scale, dilapidated Montevideo sock-factory he owns. His assistant Marta (Mirella Pascual) blithely follows his pace, even to the point of agreeing to play his wife when his estranged brother Herman (Jorge Bolani) decides to visit from Brazil. Its not much of an act, but Herman goes with it, gently fanning Martas spirit back to life and even prodding some semblance of self-inspection from the implacable Jacobo, notably during an away trip to the resort town of Piripolis. Richly observed, the film leaves a piquant aftertaste.<br />]]></review>

In giving a lift to Ranulpho (Miguel), he inadvertently picks up an assistant and  this being a movie  a friend; but what lift the film above clich are the wit and unsentimental warmth of the script, direction and performances (Miguel is especially captivating), the subtle details of characterisation and the sure sense of place.

      <review><![CDATA[There are other Neil Young concert films, of course, most notably 1979s rudimentary but valuable Rust Never Sleeps and Jim Jarmuschs 1997 grungefest Year of the Horse, but this one is complementary, capturing the long-running rocker at a very particular moment. Diagnosed with a potentially life-threatening brain aneurysm last spring, he recorded the Prairie Moon album in a matter of days in Nashville just before surgery  and, after recovery, asked Jonathan Demme to preserve a subsequent live showcase in the C&amp;W music capital. So, the Young we see here is not the raw feedback merchant of the Crazy Horse tours, but a composed veteran reflecting on mortality and core values in a mellow, lightly countrified vein as his band of top musos shuffle along in cruise control.<br />All of which may sound truly soporific to the unconverted, but even those who havent followed Youngs every recent move could well find his performance here surprisingly captivating. Delivered in front of painted backdrops enshrining the prairie, log cabin and church, the new-ish material  a direct testament to the important things in life  proves straightforward, heartfelt and rather touching, while the shows back catalogue selections affirm Young the songwriters impressive legacy. Demmes low-key, attuned direction keeps the attention on the stage, where the stars lined features betray almost four decades in the business, yet his glowing enthusiasm attests to the rejuvenating quality of gigs like this. An assured filmed record then, and Youngs affirmation of the centrality of music in his own personal and creative longevity proves authentically infectious, moving even. The old boys not ready to burn out or fade away just yet.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>***** (Five stars)<br />Instead of fixating on the topic of illegal immigrants working for low wages in America, this documentary focuses on a side of the alien experience we don't read every week in <i>The New York Times</i>illegal immigrants behind bars for murder. In following the trial of Rosa Jimenez, director Luca Gaj is able to shed new light on the struggle of incoming refugees attempting to adapt to an American way of life that they don't really understand. Jimenez, like others, is ultimately a victim of her own ignorance. By time we see the defense and prosecution give their closing arguments back to back, we know how the storys going to end, yet Gaj makes us confront every agonizing minute of this denouement. In so doing, she brings us face to face with another uncomfortable aspect of this issue: Americans love to find someone else to blame.<i>Daniel Lehrhaupt, online intern</i></p><p><i>[This is a </i>TONY<i> staff review, written for the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival.

      <review><![CDATA[Fukada plays Momoko, a schoolgirl in the second year of Junior High in a nowhere town of paddy fields two long train journeys from her favourite clothes shop in Tokyo where she buys roccoco-inspired 'Lolita' frilly dresses having conned money from her 'useless', separated, ex-minor-Yakuza father. She partners up with a biker girl of opposite mienne. <br />Part of a Japanese trend for modern Shomin-geki (films about 'ordinary life') at which directors like Nakashima and Ishii Yuya have thrown the postmodern hand-book in fashioning youth-orientated primary-coloured parodies, this employs illustrated voice-over narration to vibrant effect. Some of its jabs and jives at consumerist conformism and the theoretically youth-endearing pop-edited styling of youth media and tv ads are Japan-specific but most will be recognisable and amusing to youth audiences in any developed capitalist society. Older audiences may be required to get back in touch with their adolescent appetites for garish decor. <br />Two interesting factors 'Kamikaze Girls' has in common with many of these Shomin-geki aimed at younger audiences is, firstly, their adoption into 'realist' cinema of fantasy elements derived from animation and comics; and, secondly, how they dignify their targeted audience by, quite convincingly, making the youngsters seem older, wiser and more mature than the variously fucked-up older generation who are trying to bring them up.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Belgians are perfectly capable of being sillylook at Gargamel or Jean-Claude Van Damme. But to see them produce the kind of aggressively zany animation that we Americans gorge ourselves on is somehow disappointing. <i>A Town Called Panic</i> is playing at Film Forum because it has French voices doing the yelling and squealing. That might be justification enough for art-house fans. The stop-motion work, intentionally crude, is closer to Rankin-Bass than Wallace &amp; Gromit or Wes Andersons recent <i>Fantastic Mr. Fox;</i> all of those other examples are more sophisticated in terms of content and psychology.</p><p>A toy cowboy and Indian (voiced by cocreator Aubier and Ellison), often seen standing on their own fixed pedestals, scheme schemes in side-by-side beds like a pair of preteen brothers. Their father figure, of sorts, is a horse. Once you get over the droll joke of seeing an equine Web surfer wearing a bathrobe and sipping his morning coffee, the movie settles into a shrill groove from which it never escapes. Fans of 2007s <i>The Duchess of Langeais</i> will be glad to hear Jeanne Balibar do her best sexy voice, as a local piano teacher with the hots for the horse. (Shes a horse with long hair.) Even this brief running time, though, seems too generous. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Intelligent and chic, this account of Coco Chanels brief affair with the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky picks up where Coco Before Chanel left off: in 1920. Before that, it opens electrifyingly in 1913 with the near-riot at the premiere of The Rite of Spring. Coco is in the audience as jeers and boos greet Nijinskys dancers stomping out Stravinskys brutal, atonal score. Stravinsky (Mads Mikkelsen) storms out of the theatre.<br />Anna Mouglalis makes for an icier Coco than Audrey Tautou, hardened by the death in 1919 of Boy Capel, the love of her life. When their paths cross in 1920, Stravinsky is penniless in Paris. Chanel invites him and his family to stay at her chic villa. Its an obvious come on, and the two circle each other: Igor proud and egotistical, Coco arrogant and egotistical. Still, in the end you cant help thinking this brief love affair was just that  intense maybe, but of no huge significance to either of them. More involving are Chanels encounters with Stravinskys wife, who is bedridden with tuberculosis but knows what her husband is up to. Coco presents her with a bottle of Chanel No 5  an act of calculated cruelty. But Mrs S is no pushover, and her plain-spoken words to Coco about the effect of marriage on love might explain why Miss Chanel remained a mademoiselle.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Eddie (Charles) is a chubby 17-year old dreamer who loves scoffing chocs and watching old movies with his blowsy mum. Dad thinks he's a nancy boy, so when his mate Michael (Forsyth) calls for help the two scousers take off in search of adventure, and find it in a nightclub called 'The Fruit Machine', presided over by Annabelle (Coltrane, marvellous), an outsize drag queen whom they witness receiving too close a shave from a sicko called Echo (Payne). Running for their lives, the pair fall in with an opera singer (Stevens) and his agent (Higgins), who takes them to Brighton. Michael pays for their fares by horizontally dancing with both of them. Eddie remains oblivious to all this - he's too involved with a dripping dolphin man (Norgaard) who keeps appearing in front of him...Saville films Frank Clarke's script in a mishmash of styles, and the pace sometimes flags. But what the hell, it's as camp as Christmas, and if it rarely hits the jackpot, playing along with it is wildly enjoyable.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Films of Tennessee Williams' plays now often look very artificial and overwrought, but with this Huston came up with one of the best. Williams is treated with respect rather than reverence, and Huston injects his own sly humour. The film, which perambulates around Burton as the clergyman turned travel courier after a sex scandal, and the effects of his various crises of faith on the coachload of women teachers he is escorting (with assorted provocations from Lyon's nymphet, Gardner's blowsy hotel proprietor, Kerr's artist) is all the more interesting in the light of <i>Wise Blood</i>, Huston's later descent into the maelstrom of religious obsessions.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Presumably it was the plot of this Children's Film Foundation adventure that led one American critic to call it the teenies' <i>Chinatown</i>: blustering right-wing property developer of eminent respectability (Cossins) is uncovered by three kids as the man behind the Great Plane Robbery. Rather, we're back in the world of the <i>Dandy</i> and <i>Beano</i>, where a hit on the head means a sudden acquisition of prophetic powers, where kids become super-sleuths moving through a world of half-disguised names (Pentonmarsh Prison, Whittlewoods Pools) and get their picture on the front page of the local paper. What's more, the kids actually look as though they were thought up by a DC Thompson artist. The film develops a refreshingly conspiratorial attitude to grown-ups, and a healthy irreverence towards figures of authority. Just the right amount of laughs and a scary sequence in the Ghost Train for kids. Excellent use of London locations, natural performances, and enough wit for attendant adults.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This flawed but promising debut from writer/director Kelly is like <i>The Ice Storm</i> with a surreal psychological twist. It's 1988, and the title character (Gyllenhaal) is a moody adolescent in small town America. After a near fatal incident in which a jet engine falls on his house, Donnie suffers schizophrenic hallucinations of a spooky figure warning of imminent apocalypse. Kelly's script is an over-ambitious mess, dragging in time travel, high school politics, premonition and the presidential chances of Michael Dukakis, but his assured direction compensates. The tone alternates nimbly between comedy and horror, and two early sequences combine music (Echo and the Bunnymen's 'Killing Moon' and Tears for Fears) and image to stunning effect.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hollywoods early-70s identity crisis produced a multitude of masterpieces, but few are fit to stand alongside Bob Rafelsons autumnal 1970 tragedy Five Easy Pieces. In his most restrained and arguably finest role, Jack Nicholson plays Robert Eroica DuPea, a cultural refugee from a well-to-do musical dynasty hiding out in a California trailer park and trying unsuccessfully to drink and screw away his deep-seated sense of shame and self disgust.<br />Its a film of stark, superbly judged and beautifully sustained contrasts, the soundtrack hopping confidently from Tammy Wynette to Chopin as Bobby and his waitress girlfriend Rayette (Karen Black) travel from the lusty, sun-baked south to the cerebral, rainswept north to pay final respects to Bobbys dying father. Refusing to submit either to gross sentimentality or pompous pontificating, Rafelson and co-writer Adrien Joyce play their themes like piano keys, touching lightly but effectively on ideas of masculinity and mortality, class and creativity, family and frustration.<br />Its not a particularly subtle film  some of the supporting characters, notably Blacks dogged but witless Rayette, are written and played a little broadly  but it is a magnificently insightful and engaging one, flipping effortlessly from icy realism to heated melodrama while always maintaining a darkly comic, at times quietly satirical undercurrent. All of which is reflected in Nicholsons phenomenal central performance, for Bobby is himself a kind of actor, playing at being ugly, mean and self-sufficient in a doomed effort to disguise his absolute emotional emptiness, feeling himself exposed layer by layer as the film approaches its devastating climax.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In everything but its commercial success, <i>Batman</i> most resembles Lynch's <i>Dune</i>: plotless, unfocused, barely held together by mind-blowing sets, gadgets and costumes, and by director Burton's visual flair. It begins with promising angles - is Batman crazed vigilante or hero? Will journos Vicki Vale (Basinger) and Alex Knox (Wuhl) win the Pulitzer for discovering him? Why does Bruce Wayne spend millions dressing up as a bat? - but all are abandoned half-way through for a straight slugging match between Good and Evil. Cackling, dancing, killing for sheer humour value and hogging the best one-liners, Nicholson's Joker makes <i>The Witches of Eastwick</i> seem restrained and pulls off the greatest criminal coup of the decade: stealing a whole movie. Though Keaton is a perfect Bruce Wayne, at the heart of the film, where a <i>noir</i>-ish, psychologically disturbed Batman should be, there are only a small actor and a couple of stunt doubles in an inflexible rubber suit. Basinger's role, on the other hand, is over-inflated, presumably in order to prove by her prescence, as with Aunt Harriet in the '60s series, that there's nothing kinky about a hero who likes to dress up in cape and leathers. In the end, one's reaction to Burton's blockbuster is little more than that of the Joker to Batman: 'Where did he get those wonderful toys?']]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This comic update of the world crystallised by Raymond Chandler charts the disastrous involvement of laidback dopehead Jeff 'the Dude' Lebowski (Bridges) in a kidnapping case involving the wife of his millionaire namesake (Huddleston). The Dude is hired as bagman and of course finds himself increasingly at risk as he makes his way about an LA populated by the rich, strange and dangerous. Nor do his bowling buddies help: Donny (Buscemi) is frankly several pins short of a strike; while Walter (Goodman), a crazed, irascible Viet vet, is so determined to stand his (and the Dude's) ground that he causes more trouble than he solves. Immensely inventive and entertaining, the film may not have the enigmatic elegance or emotional resonance of <i>Barton Fink</i> or <i>Fargo, </i>but it's still a prime example of the Coens' effortless brand of stylistic and storytelling brilliance. Thanks to Roger Deakins' gleaming camerawork, T-Bone Burnett's eclectic soundtrack selection and the Coens' typically pithy dialogue, it looks and sounds wonderful. Moreover, far from being shallow pastiche, it's actually about something: what it means to be a man, to be a friend, and to be a 'hero' for a particular time and place.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An evident precursor to <i>The Driver </i>(Walter Hill scripted both, this one from Jim Thompson's novel). The major strength of <i>The Getaway </i>rests solidly on McQueen's central role, a cold tense core of pragmatic violence. Hounded by furies (two mobs, police, a hostile landscape), he responds with a lethal control, blasting his way through shootouts that teeter on madness to the loot, the girl, and Peckinpah's mythic land of Mexico. Survival, purification, and the attainment of grace are achieved only by an extreme commitment to the Peckinpah existential ideal of action - a man is what he does. Peckinpah's own control of the escalating frenzy is masterly; this is one of his coldest films, but a great thriller. CPea.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Vanessa Paradis brings out the fey side of older French male directors who should know better. Leconte has always been a sucker for a pretty curve, but he used to work around that with an idiosyncratic mix of flamboyant storytelling and a good nose for mischief making. What with its monochrome 'Scope photography and shake-a-limb camerawork, and the plot's magic-exotic conceits about knife throwing and telepathic love, here Leconte comes over all moonfaced romantic for a character who seems a wet rag even before she tries jumping in the Seine. Poor Adele, bad luck seems to follow her. Gabor (Auteil), who stops her jump, insists that her luck can change, and to prove it he throws knives at her, this being his stage act. They invest in some circus clothes, and ply their newfound luck around the Riviera. And because they're apparently psychic, they start wandering about talking to the ether like damn fools. Leconte too seems to be communing with himself, or some fantasy audience. The film has the precocious gloss of an advert, a similarly crass conception of human connection, and an utter lack of rhyme or reason.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[There's a lovely sequence about a third of the way into Anders' delightful movie which follows a song from conception - the street scene that inspires it - through the writing, to the recording session. This seamlessly edited passage swings like the snappy '60s girl pop it emulates. Like the film as a whole, it works as a musical in its own right, and as history and critique of the pop process. Anders charts the progress of Denise Waverly (the excellent Illeana Douglas), an aspiring singer signed up to write songs at the Brill Building by impresario Joel Millner (outrageously wigged-out Turturro). Denise is tough and smart, but often ill-served by a series of amorous and professional partners: beatnik radical Eric Stoltz, married DJ Bruce Davison, and finally surf sensation Matt Dillon, none of whom allows her to develop her own voice, though they all provide plenty of song material. Loosely inspired by the life of Carole King, this is a light, feminist take on 15 years of pop: hits and Ms, if you will. It begins with a bright, peppy tone, pastiching the nascent rock'n'roll scene with an affectionate smile and perfect pitch - the Larry Klein-produced soundtrack is spot on. But it's not all kitsch nostalgia: the period coincides with great social changes, particularly regarding the role of women, a recurrent Anders theme. Sharp cameos include Patsy Kensit's rival songwriter and Bridget Fonda's teen songbird with a secret love.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The fifth Pink Panther effort might seem marginally disappointing even to diehard Clouseau fans, with slapstick gags for the pratfalling clown hung very loosely on increasingly implausible jetsetting plot antics. Lom's former Chief Inspector Dreyfus, driven mad by Clouseau's bungling and now a master criminal plotting manic, twitching revenge, shifts the series into the realm of mad scientist fantasy, full-scale exploding Bavarian castle finale and all. Added to a score of movie references, it's just enough to keep one's critical faculties anaesthetised.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Earth's in peril, yet again, and the US President must call the shots. This time, though, we're rooting for the space invaders. Tim Burton's film is the most subversive big-budget Hollywood production in years, a splenetic satire which gleefully trashes contemporary culture - politics, science and religion, the army, TV, food, music, even money. Unfortunately, it's not very good. The tacky design undoubtedly cost a fortune, and there's a real perversity in casting superstars to ham it up in homage to Ed Wood. The anarchy is sometimes inspired (Burton incinerates Congress, movie stars and doves with equal abandon - he loves playing Godzilla), but much of the film is flat and cripplingly indulgent. It feels nearly half an hour too long, and Nicholson, in a double role, is just too much. It's a personal work, but not a mature one. It didn't hit home at the US box-office, but the reviews have been surprisingly accommodating. In that sense, this sour, prefabricated cult movie has the last laugh - and I'm afraid the joke's on us.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hemmed in by an arid marriage, paunchy middle-aged banker Randolph grasps another chance at life when a secret organisation transforms him into hunky Hudson and gives him a new start as an artist in Californian beach-front bohemia. Freedom, however, turns out to be a rather daunting prospect, and the struggle to fill the blank canvas comes to typify Hudson's unease with his new existence. Saul Bass' unsettling title sequence sets the scene for the concise articulation of fifty-something bourgeois despair, as visualised by James Wong Howe's distorting camerawork and the edgy discord of Jerry Goldsmith's excoriating score. After that, the film's uptight view of the hang-loose West Coast feels like a slightly forced argument, until Frankenheimer regroups and the jaws of the narrative shut tight on one of the most chilling endings in all American cinema. Little wonder it flopped at the time, only to be cherished by a later generation, notably film-makers Siegel and McGehee who drew extensively on its themes and visuals in their debut <i>Suture</i>. (This downbeat sci-fi thriller completed Frankenheimer's loose 'paranoid' trilogy - earlier instalments being <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i> and <i>Seven Days in May</i>.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hazarding another movie inspired by Stanislav Lem's novel might seem folly when Tarkovsky's 1972 version still boasts cult appeal, but Soderbergh's movie beats its predecessor in virtually every respect. It's not only richer and more rigorous, philosophically, than the Russian's woolly musings, it also has an emotional force barely there in Tarkovsky. More significantly, it's probably the finest, certainly the most stylish, sci-fi film in years. Clooney and McElhone are both immensely impressive. He's a psychotherapist Chris Kelvin, sent to the Prometheus space station to investigate strange, sinister occurrences; she's his wife Rheya, dead for years but now rejoining him, as if drawn by his guilty memories, while he and two surviving, possibly crazy crew members orbit the mysterious planet Solaris. Soderbergh uses this story to trace tangled links between time, memory, desire, fear and freedom of will, even as these connecxtions are complicated by the fact that Rheya is a sentient copy of herself. Scripted, shot, directed and edited by Soderbergh with his customary intelligence and assurance, this is perhaps the most ambiguous and cerebrally sophisticated Hollywood movie in nearly three decades.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Inspired by <i>The Arabian Nights</i>, Reiniger's charming silhouette animation was perhaps the first ever feature cartoon. Released in Germany in 1926 to a lukewarm reception, it proved a smash in Paris, where it was championed by Jean Renoir and the avant garde as a work of rare artistry and fluid beauty. Today, with allowances for some racial and sexual stereotyping, it impresses for its exquisite craftmanship, balletic movement, expressive romanticism and moments of potent sensuousness and poetry. In the days of super-expensive CGI technology and ever growing armies of animation technicians, it's worth noting that Reiniger and husband Carl Koch were a two-person factory. Ex-actress Reiniger designed and made all the articulated foot-high cutouts herself; Koch was in charge of the camera, and Walter Ruttmann and Berthold Bartosch helped with the special effects and backgrounds. As the original negative was lost, the DVD is based on the tinted restoration of the NFTVA answer print (1999); thankfully, the syrupy music added in the '50s has been replaced by Wolfgang Zeller's romantic original score.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This very engaging first feature from a former assistant to Walter Salles has a very simple, slightly over-familiar story: two young guys (Ramos and Moura), friends since childhood give a ride on their run-down cargo boat to a young stripper and prostitute (Braga), and after she starts giving them freebies, they first fall for her then fall out with each other. Whats most impressive is the way Machado and co-writer Ainouz (who directed Ramos in Madame Sata) manage to avoid not only moral judgement but dramatic clich; crucially, we see and believe in all the characters passionate feelings for one another, and come to understand and sympathise with their actions, notwithstanding the less than salubrious world (dives, stripjoints, cockfight arenas, boxing rinks, etc) in which they live and work. The performances are terrific, the direction unfussily to the point, and the film even succeeds in finding an ending thats both satisfying and credible.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Noah Baumbachs autobiographical film takes its name from a ceiling-mounted diorama in New Yorks Museum of Natural History called Clash of the Titans  an apt working title for the bitterly hilarious adventures of any kid enduring his mum and dads angry split. Based on the directors memories of his parents divorce, The Squid and the Whale draws battle lines in its opening scene, staged on a Brooklyn tennis court in 1986: Bernard Berkman (Jeff Daniels) and his teenage son, Walt (Jesse Eisenberg), on one side; mum Joan (Laura Linney) and Walts younger brother, Frank (Owen Kline), on the other. When Bernard tells Walt to exploit his mothers weak backhand and his worshipful son enthusiastically complies, its a decent first indicator of the trivial spite and sour one-upmanship that infect the couples relationship and trickle down to their children.<br />Joan is anxious and rational, difficult to pin down, and on the verge of publishing her first story in the New Yorker. Bernard is an established novelist in a slump, and a pompous, petty monster whose ego swells in inverse proportion to his declining career. After the marriage collapses, Walt and Frank ricochet between apartments and allegiances, increasingly bewildered by their parents festering resentments and sexual indiscretions: Joan beds their tennis instructor (William Baldwin), Bernard pursues a nubile writing student (Anna Paquin). Neglected Frank guzzles beer, swears like a sailor, and sticks cashews up his nose; uptight Walt struggles to emulate his father, passing smug judgement on books hes never read and playing inept head games on his adorable semi-girlfriend, Sophie (Halley Feiffer).<br />Baumbach, who co-wrote Wes Andersons The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, shot his low-budget film  clef in just 23 days, but the cogent script and tight pacing make virtues of any production constraints. Fittingly for a story of four people all variously enthralled to their hormones, The Squid and the Whale is a comedy of embarrassment, even of shame. Sexual urges express themselves in fumbling aggression or furtive solitude, and Baumbach mordantly renders the art house must-see of 1986, Blue Velvet, as a howlingly inappropriate date movie, especially when your father tags along. As Bernard, Daniels  part of a superb cast  captures a diminished mans anguish and disenfranchisement yet relishes the characters drolly outlandish self-regard. Baumbach is toughest, however, on his alter-ego. Walt is endearingly insufferable, projecting his pain on to his flighty but hardly villainous mother and so desperate to live up to his fathers standards that hell present Pink Floyds Hey You at his school talent show and just hope that no one notices.<br />Filmed in vivid, steadily handheld Super 16, The Squid and the Whale is a rueful remembrance leavened by spry verbal wit and artful brevity. Plangent and wry, the movie finds much of its magic in the closeness of farce and tragedy  the images seem to tremble with the friction between them.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The British gangster movie has taken a self-inflicted beating of late, but its not out for the count. Staying well clear of the usual parade of putdowns and punch-ups, Down Terrace takes an unexpected approach to the genre, fusing the wry realism of Ken Loach with the blackly comic bloodlust of Ken Russell to produce perhaps the best homegrown movie of the year so far.<br />The action is confined almost exclusively to one claustrophobic suburban house, where shiftless, insular dope dealers Karl (co-writer Robin Hill) and his petulant, paranoid dad, Bill (a stunning first-time performance from Hills father, Robert), are facing trouble with the law and a snitch in their midst. Everyone is in the frame: brooding matriarch Maggie (Julia Deakin), chubby, avuncular neighbour Garvey (Tony Way) and sadistic Irish thug Pringle (Michael Smiley) are all called upon to explain their actions, leading to rows, recriminations and, inevitably, bloodshed. Lots of it.<br />What director Ben Wheatley and his writing partner, Hill  veterans of TV comedy shows like Time Trumpet  manage to achieve in Down Terrace is a mounting, sickening sense of a world in freefall, where morality has been compromised to the point of meaninglessness and where distrust leads to murder, even within the family unit. And while this does result in a few berserk plot diversions, particularly in the final act, Wheatley and Hill establish such an oppressive mood and construct their characters so meticulously that even in its most extreme moments, the film remains engrossing, not to mention consistently funny and even, at times, rather sweet.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Another trump from Pixar, this is the studios tooniest toon yet, ditching high-sheen computer-generated naturalism for a world of sleek stylisation and plastic-fantastic action spectacular: our heroes are a family of dormant superheroes (Bob Parr n Mr Incredible, his missus the one-time Elastagirl and their high-powered offspring), languishing under the constraints of the FBIs superhero relocation programme after a series of encounters with litigious citizens puts them out of action. Then a secret-mission invite snags Mr Is curiosity<br /><br />Plot logic isnt the films strongest suit, and its rapid gag rate and quick-heeled turns of tale dont wholly paper over some questions begged, not to mention some ideological loose ends. The film brilliantly acknowledges the experience of parental compromise and glory-days nostalgia, commingles that with the everyman fantasy of repressed eminence, and then seems to egg on the latters anti-egalitarian ethic: how else to interpret the dictum that saying everyone is special is another way of saying no one is, a jibe the film makes twice? And its pastiche of caped-crusader tropes neatly (and unironically) synchs with the enduring American daydream of global salvation. <br />But what pastiche, what playfulness! Seamlessly blending comic-book caper, domestic comedy and sci-fi spy fantasy, the film is a triumph of design, wit and zip, from its villains retro-futurist island hideaway to the montage of superhero couture faux-pas presented by the Incredibles dotty confidante Madame Edna (Birds own spoof of the late Hollywood costumier Edith Head). Bombastic finale aside, its a cut (and an age-range) above the simplicities of Finding Nemo. Bud Luckeys accompanying short rhyming rondelay Boundin is double reason to get to the cinema on time.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Just as French realist cinema latterly needed a shot in the arm from such uncompromising, hard-edged banlieue thrillers as La Haine and LEsquive, so this promising writer-director debut from former commercials and pop-promos director Eran Creevy shows how a knowing eye and a sympathetic vision can reinvigorate the stale conventions of our own recent cycle of (sub)urban dramas such as Rise of the Footsoldier and Kidulthood. <br />Set in the council estates of fictional Dudlowe (standing in for Creevys native Harlow), Shifty traces the reacquaintance of two friends: humorously laconic Chris (Daniel Mays, excellent), visiting home for 24 hours after four long years in Manchester quietly recuperating from moral and romantic wounds inflicted by an old girlfriend; and Shifty (Riz Ahmed), an intelligent and once ambitious school pal of Chris who has become progressively hardened, boxed in and self-justifying by a life spent supplying drugs. The dealing is an occupation that Shifty is keen to keep secret from the more orthodox Muslim older brother (Nitin Ganatra) with whom he shares a house.<br /><br />So far, then, all seems familiar. The scene is set for a clash of loyalties and a contrast of destinies between the sobered, returning hero and the bad egg, with the rules and tropes of the old westerns ready to be played out in the new concrete battlegrounds of our housing estates. But, some minor hiccups aside (not least the role of Jason Flemyng as Shiftys boss Glen), what Creevy delivers is something far more seductive, witty and involving: a non-deterministic portrait of a friendship thats allowed to emerge organically and suggestively through the subtle, enjoyable interplay, mannerisms, body language and banter of the principals. Creevys fine ear for dialogue, sensitive and productive direction of actors and confident control of tone is all the more impressive for being delivered under the short schedule and tight budgetary exigencies of Film Londons Microwave initiative.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[So immaculate and rich was the idea behind the first Toy Story movie  the anxieties of a box of retro toys  that releasing a similar sequel worked like a dream. Seeing the film ten years later  and in the mighty shadow of Pixars recent masterpieces  the film feels a little chaotic, safe, tired on its feet: deficiencies that remastering it in 3D (which adds less than nothing to the viewing experience) serves to expose rather than conceal. I know, saying youre not a huge fan of Toy Story 2 is like admitting you dont like throwing snowballs or eating ice cream, but the familiarity of the characterisations and the story arc (not to mention the smug humour) make this a film of great moments rather than a brilliant whole. Still, the scene of Jessie the Yodelling Cowgirl singing about being dumped by an owner is a complete heartbreaker and a clear forerunner to the riskier material that Pixar would tangle with in future projects. In short: 3D, go home!]]></review>

Desperate for inspiration, he follows an imperious Princess flanked by Fascist (or 'Cruising') type police. Her rubber-gloved hand leads through the looking-glass to a slow-motion night kingdom. This <i>Sur-Noir </i>fantasy has more meanings than the Book of Revelations. It's an allegory for Poetry. It's the Confessions of a Gay Opium-Eater. Its mirrors and misogyny, optical tricks and enigmatic phrases, mark it as prime meat for Lacanians and feminists. With its Resis-tance Band radios and brutal militiamen it catches the terrors of Occupation life. Its tight cross-lacing of paranoid dreaming and poetic realism grips like a bondage corset.

      <review><![CDATA[Brain-dead, sunken-eyed, shambling and gormless - London's 20-somethings don't look set to wrest control of the universe any time soon. In fact some are enough to make you despair of the human race. Take Shaun (Pegg), a genial bloke with lovely girlfriend (Ashfield) and well-developed pint arm and PlayStation thumbs ... But could he stretch his horizons beyond the local boozer if his relationship depended on it? The horde of zombies on his doorstep may not know where they're going, but at least they know how to pick themselves up off the floor and stumble on. A slacker romp, this 'rom-zom-com' from the creative duo behind the Channel 4 sitcom <i>Spaced</i> takes a simple conceit (think George Romero meets early Kevin Smith) and goofs off with it something rotten. The cast make a cosy fit, the patter is still sitcom snappy, but Wright also has the visual snap to carry this saga of backyard apocalypse.

      <review><![CDATA[The Sandford Players tribute to Romeo and Juliet isnt your average pigs ear of a local production: this particular pigs ear is modelled on Baz Luhrmanns high-octane celluloid adaptation, down to a curtain-call singalong of The Cardigans Lovefool, as featured on Luhrmanns soundtrack. Wham-bam am-dram  surely a hiding to nothing if ever there was one? Yet with Hot Fuzz, as with Shaun of the Dead before it, Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg show that a Hollywood genre aesthetic can be grafted onto the preposterously inappropriate fabric of banal English life with surprising success  as long as you take it seriously.Pegg plays Nicholas Angel, a high-achieving London sergeant dispatched to the West Country because hes showing up his fellow Met officers. Greeted reasonably warmly, especially by town drunk and fellow copper Danny (Nick Frost), he makes some stiff steps towards finding a place in the tight-knit community. But, compulsively alert as he is, Angel starts to wonder if theres more to a series of accidental local deaths than meets the eye<br />Though Wright and Peggs latest is stocked with as many film and TV references as Spaced and Shaun, it mines most of its plentiful laughs from the collision of Angels uptight uprightness with the lackadaisical village ways of Sandford, a genteel backwater of quintessentially English naffness that suddenly becomes the backdrop for a crescendo of disarmingly credible chase and shoot-out set-pieces. Its Peggs stonily straight-faced performance  amid an almost distractingly high-calibre cast of comedy stalwarts (Bill Bailey, Olivia Colman, Adam Buxton) and legit luminaries (Jim Broadbent, Billie Whitelaw, Timothy Dalton as a moustache-twirling supermarket manager)  that holds things together, and also reflects the films essentially respectful attitude towards the action movie. Hot Fuzz isnt a spoof or parody: its jokes arent at the expense of genre expectations, but its characters failure to live up to them; correspondingly, the editing is sincerely frenetic and the violence, though sometimes ridiculous, is strong and bloody. Its not a perfect template  running motifs are glaringly flagged up and there are at least two too many climaxes  but for both gags and thrills, few current British filmmakers come close. The Sandford Players can eat their hearts out.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Its something of a coup that Jerry Seinfeld has managed to mangle together 90 minutes worth of semi-decent bee jokes for his feature-writing debut. Alas, its probably the only noteworthy aspect in this otherwise waxen slab of digitally animated anthropomorphism which is little more than a series of loosly linked sketches with the odd celebrity cameo (does Sting count?) squeezed into the process for adult viewers. Seinfeld lends his shrill but solipsistic Noo Yoik drawl to the voice of Barry B Benson, a sprightly honeybee determined to break free from the punchclock tedium of hive life in order to experience the outside world. In doing so, he makes the shock discovery that humans harvest and consume the honey which so many of his bee brethren have toiled to produce. He decides to file a lawsuit against the entire human race.</p><p>Where a film like Ratatouille had the good grace to counterbalance some of its more far-fetched plot machinations with a surfeit of wit and wisdom, Bee Movie piles up the big asks without once stopping to offer the point to all of this. Passes the time, but undoutedly one for the little uns.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Realism has rarely felt as mannered as it does in this Chicago-set offering from mumblecore linchpin, Joe Swanberg, in which the myriad sexual adventures of irksome indie chick Hannah (Greta Gerwig) are captured in earthy, almost vulgar detail. Filmed with a tiny crew (but without a script) on juddering, hand-held digital video, theres certainly something amiable about the cluttered, communal vibe on show, but where these techniques may have had their financial advantages, here is a film which achieves little more than its meagre means will allow for. One key problem is that the intended air of blunt naturalism is mired in the actors awkward habit of playing to the camera, and while theres an interesting discordance between the banal (really banal) dialogue and the characters internal emotions, its never enough to establish any sensitivity or social pertinence beyond the trifling tiffs which are playing out on screen.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>For sheer contrariness, lets tip our hat to any film that would enter the hyperadrenalized <i>Speed Racer</i> zone clad almost entirely in long shots of elderly folk discussing the weather. (Take that, Emile Hirsch.) But dont nod too reverently. Your head may not rise.</p><p>Bearing a leisurely title that proves only too fitting, Paraguayan Hammock will almost undoubtedly lull you into private contemplation of your own favorite bedding, as its married protagonists (Del Rio and Genes) sway in the hammock and bicker in their soothing Guarani dialect over the possibility of rain, the quieting of a barking dog and other passing concerns.<br /></p><p>Eventually, they do get around to a serious subject: their absent son, almost certainly a military casualty in Paraguays ongoing civil war. Still, they cant be totally sure, and as director Paz Encina modulates her shots to tighter perspectives and the talk goes voiceover, you realize that these are the ruminations of parents facing the worst possible future. Paraguays first movie to receive theatrical distribution here in 30 years was funded by New Crowned Hope, the same art concern responsible for Tsai Ming-liangs dreamy <i>I Dont Want to Sleep Alone. </i>Of course the film is gentle and suggestive. But youll have to provide any stirring emotions yourself.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Cracking an enigma: thats the mission that Italian director Paolo Sorrentino sets himself with his third film, a slick but never superficial portrait of the much accused, never convicted Italian politician Giuilio Andreotti. He served as a Christian Democrat prime minister seven times from the 1970s to the 90s and his career hit its crucifixion and resurrection in the late 1990s and early 2000s when he was tried both for having connections to the Mafia and for instigating the murder of a journalist. He was judged guilty of the latter but had his conviction overturned on appeal. Now 90, he remains in the Italian senate.<br />Its safe to say that Sorrentino doesnt side with his countrys judicial system: his stunning film, which couldnt be less of a traditional biopic if it tried, with its unsettling clash of the classical and the modern, from the music (Vivaldi, Trio) to the mise-en-scne (Antonioni meets car adverts), squarely places Andreotti in the centre of a sinister network of politics, business, religion and crime. An opening montage of violent deaths, including Gods banker Roberto Calvi hanging from Blackfriars Bridge, speaks volumes about the films attitude to its subject. The first half is a speedy onslaught of episodes in Andreottis later life that culminates in a barrage of accusations  surely the films conscience  from a journalist. The second half slows down slightly and tightens its focus on the approach to his trial, the endless flashbulbs in his face a sinister contrast with a demeanour that couldnt be less suggestive of celebrity.</p><p>Actor Toni Servillo, the lead in Sorrentinos first film, The Consequences of Love (2004), plays Andreotti as a walking corpse, a shuffling, silent, migraine-afflicted mystery. Hes surrounded by the more colourful members of his faction and carries the physical awkwardness of a schoolboy. Hes almost a caricature with his gargoyle ears, his hunched back and his deathly movements  he glides like a Hoover in slo-mo. But theres enough compassion to make this more than a cartoon: indeed, theres enough in one scene in which Andreotti watches a crooner on television with his wife. Briefly we see behind the mask of his public persona.<br /><br />Unless youre closely acquainted with Italian politics, its unlikely that the onslaught of names and allusions to politicians, the Mafia, P2 (the anti-communist Masonic lodge) and the business world will entirely compute. But that doesnt matter: Sorrentinos skill is to tell his story almost entirely visually. The telling is breathtaking, a showy, musical dance that somehow bombards you with facts but limits dialogue to a minimum. Sorrentino surprises with every new shot, camera move, juxtaposition, snippet of humour and dollop of dread. As character assassination, its delicious and deadly.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Portuguese elder statesman Manoel de Oliveira has been making films since 1931. The 101 year olds delightful latest is a perfectly executed comic miniature on the perils of old-fashioned courtship. Delivered as an irate remembrance from the seat of a train, the story describes the lengths to which pretty boy Marcrio (Ricardo Trpa) goes to woo the sultry maiden (Catarina Wallenstein) who throws him come-hither looks from a window opposite his office. Playing on the idea that our traditional notions of romance are at loggerheads with the modern world, the films players struggle to uphold the chivalry and politesse expected during a burgeoning relationship. Sly, understated and ruthlessly focused, the functional yet elegant photography by Sabine Lancelin enhances the films ironic kick.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Following a welcome return to his bug-eyed heyday in Bad Lieutenant, Nicolas Cage again goes for the big-bucks jackpot of the family movie with The Sorcerers Apprentice, reuniting with National Treasure director Jon Turteltaub for a breezily entertaining but forgettable magical romp. Cage plays Balthazar Blake, a mage locked in a long war of wills with sleazy, power-hungry warlock Horvath (Alfred Molina), until the appearance of bumbling student physicist and natural magician Dave (Jay Baruchel) threatens to tip the balance. Cue training montages, wacky mop-based mishaps and deafening plasma-bolt battles on New Yorks streets. <br />With Cage playing it relatively straight and serious, the show is stolen by moustache-twirling Molina and his David Copperfield-inspired acolyte Drake, essayed with oily glee by Toby Kebbell. But with Baruchels likeable lead turn hamstrung by a disastrous romantic subplot, some distinctly non-special effects and a script loaded with blunt expository dialogue, the film casts a superficial and short-lived spell.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Returning to the rich pastures of American suburbia, Spielberg takes the utterly commonplace story of a lonely kid befriending an alien from outer space, and invests it with exactly the same kind of fierce and naive magic that pushed Disney's major masterpieces like <i>Pinocchio</i> into a central place in 20th century popular culture. Moreover, with its Nativity-like opening and its final revelation, the plot of <i>E.T.</i> has parallels in religious mythology that help to explain its electric effect on audiences. But although conclusively demonstrating Spielberg's preeminence as the popular artist of his time, <i>E.T.</i> finally seems a less impressive film than <i>Close Encounters</i>. This is partly because its first half contains a couple of comedy sequences as vulgar as a Brooke Bond TV chimps commercial, but more because in reducing the unknowable to the easily loveable, the film sacrifices a little too much truth in favour of its huge emotional punch.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its like a Pavlovian reaction. I know its coming but I can do nothing about it. The strings swell for the introduction to Over the Rainbow and already Im wavering. Judy Garland gets a few lines into the song and Im emotional wreckage. Every single time<br />Oh, but this is supposed to be some creaky old kids movie, a charming relic of vintage MGM showmanship, full of chirpy songs and midgets and a wee dog. Not to be taken to heart, surely? Well, intellectually that may be so, but this is one instance where the vagaries of cinematic fashion simply dont apply. Like Chaplins The Kid or ET The Extra-Terrestrial, The Wizard of Oz simply lays bare primal emotions, exposes our childhood anxieties about abandonment and powerlessness and brings to light the tension between the repressive comforts of home and the liberating terrors of the unknown marking all our adult lives.<br />After all, who wouldnt, like Dorothy, want to leave black-and-white Kansas farmland, where the people are lovely but they just dont understand you, and try your luck in the jolly old land of Oz, where life is lived with the magically fervid intensity of three-strip Technicolor? Yet with the thrill of escape and the cusp of maturity come all sorts of insecurities: what if you cant ever go home again? What if the adults in whom you put your faith cant help you because theyre too busy with their own fallibilities? What if, like those you meet, youre not sufficiently smart, courageous or emotionally astute to deal with this brave new world? And what if it contains cackling, cruel individuals bent on doing you harm? What then? Put it like that, and maybe the film wrings tears from grown-ups because it hot-wires us to the pain of growing up.<br />Garlands performance is key here. She was 17 at the time, and although the vestiges of childlike innocence are still there, she conveys an undertow of trepidation, put across with the adolescents jangling nerve-ends. The cheesy, insentient bravado of a moppet-ish child actor would have ruined it completely. Yet you cant imagine Garland, or anyone else in the splendid cast of vaudevillian pros, being self-conscious about the timeless significance of what they were doing. This was just another studio shoot, and although masterly craftsmanships evident in every frame and every bar of Harburg and Arlens wonderful score, the production lurched from crisis to crisis. A string of directors included King Vidor and George Cukor as well as credited journeyman Victor Fleming, while Toto was out injured for two weeks when somebody stepped on him, Wicked Witch Margaret Hamilton got badly burned when she went up in a puff of smoke and the first Tin Man wound up in hospital with aluminium poisoning.<br />What they left us with, though, is celluloid alchemy of the highest order. Kids will continue to love this movie, but perhaps only adults really get it. See this luminous restoration and rediscover the power of truly great storytelling to reveal us to ourselves. Just follow the Yellow Brick Road]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Superlatives are in short supply to describe the emotional power of Terence Davies fractured chronicle of the life of a working-class family in 1940s and 50s Liverpool. Drawing on his own childhood, Davies turns his film on the pivot of a brutal patriarchs death and his daughters subsequent marriage, so splitting his film into two episodes (which he filmed a year apart). The first, Distant Voices, is a set of difficult memories of childhood fear and wartime suffering that drift in and out of the wedding day, while its companion, Still Lives, portrays the life of a happier widow, her two daughters, a son and their friends who gather in pubs, sing and are beginning to suffer their own marriages. Pete Postlethwaite is Tommy Davies, the violent, damaged and taciturn father; Freda Dowie is Mrs Davies, his stoic wife and the suffering lynchpin of the family; and Angela Walsh is Eileen, the daughter whose marriage blows a gust of fresh air into the stale misery of her family but also threatens to follow the same tragic pattern as her parents.<br />Davies storytelling is a unique joy. Images evoke family photos and the struggle of recollection. Voices drift in and out, suggestive of family ghosts and inner demons. Chronology is poetic, and memories are filtered after the event like the films washed-out colour palette. The writer-director offers a terrifying tension between the public solidarity of pub sing-a-longs, marriage celebrations and mourning and the private horror of domestic abuse, depression and personal dreams sought and destroyed. The men are the most flawed, but the women, though the heroines of the piece, are compromised too: Why did you marry him, mam? asks a daughter. He was nice. He was a good dancer Its a heartbreaking work. Its cast are phenomenal; its songs flow through the film like blood; and Davies is unflinching in his hunt for truth and full of nothing but love and understanding for his characters. A masterpiece.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Tati's Hulot on the loose in a surreal, scarcely recognisable Paris, tangling intermittently with a troop of nice American matrons on a 24-hour trip. Not so much a saga of the individual against an increasingly dehumanised decor, it's more a semi-celebratory symphony to Tati's sensational city-set, all reflections and rectangles, steel, chrome, gleaming sheet metal and <i>trompe l'oeil</i> plate glass. Shot in colour that looks almost like monochrome, recorded in five-track stereo sound with scarcely a word of speech (the mysterious language of objects echoes louder than words), this jewel of Tati's career is a hallucinatory comic vision on the verge of abstraction.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A sprawling, discursive fresco: three stories bookended by a prologue and epilogue. In the first story, a mobster (Travolta) is charged with looking after the irresponsible wife (Thurman) of his vengeful boss. In the second, a washed-up boxer (Willis) tries to trick the Mob by failing to throw a fight. And in the third, two hitmen (Travolta and Jackson) carry out a job, only to call on the services of a 'cleaner' (Keitel) when it gets messier than planned. It's the way Tarantino embellishes and, finally, interlinks these old chestnuts that makes the film alternately exhilarating and frustrating. There's plenty of sharp, sassy, profane dialogue, and there are plenty of acute, funny references to pop culture, though the talk sometimes delays the action, and the references sometimes seem self-consciously arch. And there are, too, the sudden lurches between humour and violence - shocking, but without moral depth. What writer/director Tarantino lacks, as yet, is the maturity to invest his work with anything that might provoke a heartfelt emotional response to his characters. Very entertaining, none the less.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[During the Depression, downtrodden housewife Farrow so inflames a film's leading man (an explorer-poet) that he climbs down from the screen, and entices her into a chaotic but charming love affair. Woody Allen's deft script investigates every nook and cranny of the couple's bizarre relationship, the irate Pirandellian reactions of the illusory characters left up on the screen, and the bewilderment of the actor whose movie persona has miraculously gone walkies. As the star-struck couple, Farrow and Daniels work wonders with fantastic emotions, while Allen's direction invests enough care, wit and warmth to make it genuinely moving.]]></review>

Lord Olivier turns up under a policeman's helmet to stare suspiciously at Donat's - 'But it moved!' - first triumphant screen projection. Then there's (among others) Jack Hulbert, Kathleen Harrison, Margaret Rutherford, Peter Ustinov, Stanley Holloway, Robertson Hare, Emlyn Williams, Ronald Shiner, Cecil Parker and most of the cast of <i>Radio Fun</i>, who all deferred most of their salaries.

      <review><![CDATA['Off tacks and main sheet!' commands Russell Crowe's pony-tailed, gimlet-eyed Royal Navy captain, 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey, in Weir's rousing 1805 adventure, adapted from two of Patrick O'Brian's much-admired seafaring novels. Aubrey's three-masted frigate HMS <i>Surprise</i>, cruising the coast of Brazil on the lookout for Napoleon's allies, comes under splintering fire from the fleeter French privateer <i>Acheron</i> and lifts off in the fog. The sailing master (Pugh) counsels caution, but the standfast Aubrey, who fought with Nelson on the Nile, will have his man, whatever the odds, come hell or high water. Thanks in no small measure to <i>Perfect Storm</i> designer William Sandell, this handsomely mounted actioner exudes the authentic tang of salt, sweat and gunpowder. Cameraman Russell Boyd gives painterly expression to the ship's 'little world' and, as in <i>Gallipoli</i>, Weir shows his adroitness at action and the psychology of men at war, helped by a string of sterling performances, notably Bettany's Darwin-esque doctor (Aubrey's friend, cello partner and obverse) and young Pirkis as a heroic aristocratic midshipman. Nice too to hear English accents in a major US production, especially Crowe's clipped tones, and a well used classically oriented score stripped of bombast. If there's a problem, it's the insistence on the warrior/man-of-science dichotomy, which has the film meander off on a naturalist jaunt through the Galapagos to tension-slackening effect. But in the main, a fine old-fashioned <i>Boy's Own</i> yarn.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Originally intended for TV, <i>Mulholland Dr.</i> is much in the mould of <i>Twin Peaks</i> and <i>Lost Highway</i>. Lynch's characteristically bizarre <i>noir</i> focuses (probably too strong a word!) on a young beauty (Harring) who loses her memory after a car accident and hides out in a house where she's found and befriended by the absent owner's helpful niece (Watts), new to LA in the hope of becoming an actress. Meanwhile, a hot young film director (Theroux) is having trouble with the Mob trying to influence his choice of leading lady. Despite too many detours into nonsensical narrative cul-de-sacs, and too many shots that slowly travel towards corners down darkened corridors to the accompaniment of ominous rumbles, this works well enough as unsettlingly nightmarish suspense. That is, until it suddenly and stupidly decides to switch characters' identities, leaving one with a so-what feeling of dj vu.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The story is risible, the direction routine, the underlying ethic highly questionable; but the flying stirs the blood like speed. This concerns the exploits of one 'Maverick' (Cruise), who aspires to be top gun at the Top Gun, the US Navy Fighter Weapons School at San Diego. In what looks suspiciously like a retread of the <i>An Officer and a Gentleman</i> storyline, Maverick, an arrogant piece of Officer Material, climbs the ladder of fly-boy success, falls in love with his aeronautics instructor (an unlikely McGillis), and has his best friend and navigator (Edwards) fall off the ladder and into a concrete cloud. However, the traditional mainstays of love and death are here supplemented by lengthy and highly realistic dog-fight sequences, in which the pupils and instructors tail-chase each other all over the desert sky, and then do it for real with an unnamed enemy over the Indian Ocean. A great ride to hell and back; kick the tyres, light the fires, and you're away. CPea.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The latest would-be crowd-pleasing Britcom takes its cue from a true story, and offers befuddled Joel Edgerton, whos just inherited a traditional Northampton shoe factory heading for bankruptcy, unlikely salvation in the beefy form of Chiwetel Ejiofors drag artiste  who reveals a hitherto unsuspected niche for sturdy high heels suitable for chaps in dresses. Thus we get triumph-of-the-underdog with a sequinned twist, except that the movie makes a real meal of getting to its all-singing, all-dancing finale at a Milan fashion show. Theres a dreary half-hour of contrived complications in the middle, for instance, while the chemistry between the two male leads is policed to rule out any suggestion of mutual attraction  instead, Edgerton faces a clumsily loaded choice between his duck-faced nominal fiance and Sarah-Jane Potts perky salt-of-the-earth employee. Ejiofor, on the other hand, runs through his dance routines with gusto, gets to sing Whatever Lola Wants, but has no discernible sexuality of his own. Overall, its breezy, forgettable fluff, but kinky? Obviously, the term is relative.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The original French version of this adaptation of Marjane Satrapis sensitive and sharp autobiographical graphic novel picked up the Prix du Jury at last years Cannes and was nominated for the animated feature Oscar earlier this year. Now theres an English-language version, with Sean Penn voicing Marjanes sensible, caring father, Chiara Mastroianni reprising her role as Marjane, and Gena Rowlands stepping in as Marjanes worldly wise grandmother with a great line in bitchy, conspiratorial put-downs. Iggy Pop even features as the voice of Marjanes impressive, radical uncle.<br />Its not the voices, though, that make Satrapis film so distinctive: that honour goes to her soft black-and-white drawings of characters and foregrounds and her charcoal backgrounds of Tehran or Vienna or Paris. Also distinctive is her precocious child-turned-reflective adults eye view of the people around her and the changing fortunes of Iran. Born in 1969, Satrapis passage from childhood to adulthood coincided with her countrys own passage from Shah through revolution to Islamic state. Outspoken and disruptive as a smart schoolgirl in the new Iran, Satrapi was sent to a school in Vienna, where she discovered music and men and struggled with the bourgeois apathy of her anarchist schoolmates. She later settled in Paris, and its a series of inserts, in colour, of her as an adult at Charles de Gaulle airport, reflecting on the past, that gives the film its voiceover and sense of reminiscence.<br />Persepolis is realism seen through special eyes. Satrapis animation, with its stark monochrome palette and soft edges, allows her to stress the warmth of her family while suddenly lunging into the mood of claustrophobia caused by prying relatives, Irans moral police or leering men on the street. The shift from French subtitles, which suited the films roots in the graphic novel, to English voices (especially with the political undercurrents of Penns involvement) may jar a little with anyone who has seen the original, but thats a minor quibble. This is a delightful, curious film that indulges in both the personal and the political and provides a potted history of modern Iran through one womans experience.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Set in a Louisiana bayou, Adam Greens old school slasher movie has all the right ingredients for a gruesome gumbo, but lacks an all-important piquancy. Bloody deaths, jokey cameos by Robert Englund and Tony Todd, breast-baring blondes, a killing-by-numbers plot and raucous rock music from pasty-faced poseur Marilyn Manson are thrown into the pot. Yet somehow the tired flavours never quite mingle. <br />On Halloween night, a hapless tour guide strands lovelorn twentysomething Ben (Joel Moore) and his wise-cracking black pal Marcus (Deon Richmond) in a supposedly haunted swamp. They and their fellow tourists  a porn director, two ditzy actresses, a middle-aged couple and a shy teenage girl  are then haunted and hunted by hatchet-faced hick Victor Crowley. Burned and hacked with an axe as a child, the hideously deformed Victor now likes to tear off the heads or chop off the limbs of passing strangers. Greens efforts to strike a balance between knowing humour and no-holds-barred horror are stymied by an erratic tone: a slow, talky build-up gives way to a soggy middle section and a messy, all-stops-out finale.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[DVD is ruining historical education in this country: with hundreds of movies now available, theres no reason for the families of middle England to gather around the TV on a wet bank holiday afternoon to watch The Colditz Story for the umpteenth time. But help is at hand: in Valkyrie, Tom Cruise doesnt just set out to beat the Boche, but to save the great British Sunday.<br />Its surprising that Hollywood never got around to making an all-star epic about the plot of July 1944, in which a group of disgruntled generals, led by the aristocratic von Stauffenberg (Cruise), attempted to off the Fhrer and rescue Germanys reputation. The failure of the assassination plan, and the attempted coup that followed, marked the end of organised Germanic resistance to Hitlers regime.<br />Director Bryan Singer takes a staunchly old-school approach, assembling a cast of reliable British thesps and dividing the action between swastika-adorned wood-panelled offices and rainswept, shadowy Berlin streets. The period is exactingly recreated, with the camera lingering lovingly over leather jackboots, snarling dogs and those fetishistic, immaculately starched uniforms. <br />Valkyrie has serious flaws: the script, by Nathan Alexander and Singers longtime compadre Christopher McQuarrie, takes an age to get going and steers clear of any moral ambiguity. Too many of the prestigious cast  notably Kenneth Branagh and token female Carice van Houten  are underused, and the accents are simply ludicrous, with Cruises mid-American drawl sitting awkwardly alongside Branaghs cultured RP and the Fhrers Teutonic whine. But as old-fashioned historical escapism goes, this is solid, compelling stuff.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ralph Fiennes is Michael Berg, the present-day narrator of this film and Bernard Schlinks 1995 novel, a middle-aged German lawyer whom we first encounter making breakfast for a younger bedfellow but refusing to exchange intimacy for commitment. We reconvene in 1958 and 15-year-old Michael (David Kross), a clever child from an academic family, loses his virginity to taciturn Hanna (Kate Winslet), a mysterious, 36-year-old trolleybus worker whom he encounters in the street. He falls in love; she enjoys hearing him read from Tolstoy until she disappears one day without warning. Several years later, Michael, a law student, encounters Hanna in a new context  one that reveals devastating facts about his former lover. A new, unusual relationship emerges, at a distance, and one that stretches over many years. To reveal more would damage the debate at the films heart: an argument that pitches feelings against facts and, necessarily, asks more questions than it answers.<br /><br />David Hares unshowy, thoughtful screenplay, Stephen Daldrys unfussy direction and Roger Deakins and Chris Mengess impressive cinematography are faithful to the detail and tenor of Schlinks novel, which is a complex beast in simple clothing. The Reader has been called a Holocaust film but thats not entirely accurate. It would be better tagged a post-Holocaust work as it pitches itself between the known facts of that cataclysm and the unanswerable philosophical questions of its fallout relating to responsibility, law, justice and forgiveness; all the while considering education, and literacy, as crucial to those debates. Its dynamic is generational: Schlink and Berg are second-generation voices, embroiled in first-generation issues, addressing a third-generation audience. Its issues are infinite and moveable. Its a bold and challenging work.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[There is an unspoken rule in Hollywood that states that, in order for two men to love one another, at least one must die. We saw it in Philadelphia. We saw it again in Brokeback Mountain. A similar rule applies in this debut feature from Peru, only here its played out with an unexpected twist.<br /><br />Miguel (Cristian Mercado) and Santiago (Manolo Cardona) are secret lovers  secret because Miguel has a heavily pregnant wife, and because the fishing village where they live isnt exactly progressive when it comes to homosexual relationships. We know this because Santiago is open about his sexuality, and as a result has been ostracised by the entire community. Women murmur things under their breath, while the men are overtly hostile. Nobody calls him by his name. He is referred to simply as the artist.<br />So when Santiago drowns in a tragic accident and reappears as a spirit only Miguel can see, hear and touch, in many ways it looks like the perfect solution. Miguel can continue his relationship without the fear of being found out. Theres just one problem. Until his body is found and buried in accordance with custom, Santiagos soul is unable to pass peacefully to the afterlife. What follows is a test of Miguels measure of himself as a man and of the love he feels for his family and the man he has so far denied.<br />The symbolism might sound a little heavy, and there are odd moments when the dialogue threatens to weigh things down. One scene in which Santiago coaxes Miguel to come and join him out in the open is mercifully short. But the performances are so convincing and the photography so breathtakingly beautiful, youre easily swept along. <br />Theres humour too, much of it at the expense of Latin American stereotypes, machismo and the automatic suspicion of a man who prefers watching Brazilian soap operas to football (Cardona, the Colombian actor who plays Santiago, is well known for his macho roles in television dramas).<br />But for all its knowing asides and playful twists on the traditional love triangle, this is no romantic comedy. In the end, Undertow achieves a kind of lyricism rarely seen in contemporary gay filmmaking. Its a film about modern sexual identity, but also about traditional values like honour, truth and the need for courage. Its an impressive debut, and a fine example of Latin American cinemas use of magical realism to explore difficult themes and deliver deeply affecting messages. Winner of the Audience Award for World Cinema at this years Sundance Film Festival, this is a true gem. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Lush Goldwyn weepie, based on a Guy Bolton play previously filmed by George Fitzmaurice in 1925, with Ronald Colman and Vilma Banky. Man loves woman who turns to his equally smitten cousin when he's reported killed in the war, but finds (gulp) that he's only blinded and living in self-sacrificial hiding. Irredeemable tosh (with a distinctly tepid performance from Oberon), despite Lillian Hellman script and sleek Gregg Toland camerawork.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Only superlatives will do to describe Keatons hilarious Civil War dramatic comedy. Made in 1927, at the culmination of the silent era, it sees the graceful, stone-faced genius at his inventive best. Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack), fiance of Western and Atlantic railway engineer Johnnie Gray (Keaton), wrongly suspects him of cowardice. When, in a preamble to hostilities, Union spies abduct her  along with her rival for Johnnies affections, the titular locomotive  he hot-rails it in pursuit of them both. What follows is a thrilling adventure yarn, based essentially upon a pair of hurtling and symmetrically opposed train chases, that is as superbly structured as it is executed.<br />The extraordinary budget (some $400,000)  allowed Keaton unprecedented freedom  and resulted in a series of  his most spectacular large-scale set pieces. But what makes the film so special is the way the timing, audacity and elegant choreography of its sight gags, acrobatics, pratfalls and dramatic incidents is matched by Busters directorial artistry, his acute observational skills working alongside the physical lan and sweet subtlety of his own performance. On another level, its also very satisfying as a Civil War drama (not to mention train movie), with Keatons ardour for authenticity expressed in his beautifully detailed (and expensive) period reconstruction. You have to watch every inch of the frame in a Keaton movie; youll find things that will continually delight and surprise.The cool contemporary response to the film disappointed poor Buster, but since then its status has steadily grown and grown and now its accepted as one of the greatest ever film comedies. This revival  heading a two-month NFT Keaton retrospective  will be digitally projected and feature Carl Daviss fitting score.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Ghostbusters</i> combines two of the most popular Hollywood products in recent years: <i>National Lampoon</i>/<i>Saturday Night Live</i>-style comedy and state-of-the-art special effects. But the story of a trio of incompetent 'experts' in the paranormal (Murray, Aykroyd and Ramis), who set up as ghostbusters after they are canned from their college sinecures, is less cynical a construction than it sounds. Reitman shows greater flair at controlling the anarchic comic rhythms of the <i>Lampoon</i>/<i>SNL</i> crowd than most of the directors who have attempted that hopeless task, and the effects are truly astonishing. <i>Close Encounters</i> meets <i>Animal House</i>, incidentally giving Murray's sleazily self-confident persona his best leading part to date.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Based on Henri Charrire's bestselling epic about life imprisonment in a French penal colony, <i>Papillon </i>begins atmospherically with the heat and deprivation well conveyed. But with Schaffner unable to find the necessary perspective to prevent the film from becoming unevenly episodic, it ends up looking as if it were tacked together by at least three different directors. Jerry Goldsmith's insistent music doesn't help much either. Consequently McQueen's escape bids and subsequent doses of solitary take on the proportions of a masochist's marathon. He battles manfully against miscasting and a script that remains content merely to celebrate his prowess. He almost carries it off, apart from one romantic dalliance, true Hollywood South Seas style, and the totally perfunctory final half-hour.]]></review>

A routine operation to rescue a cabinet minister captured by South American guerrillas turns into a fight to the death when Arnie's crack platoon is picked off one by one by an invisible adversary, which then makes itself visible, removes its protective helmet, and challenges him to a fair (!) fight. With its stilted dialogue and hammy acting, the film has the look of an expensive production but the feel of a B movie, delivering the sort of undemanding monster mayhem Arnie's fans have come to expect.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A marvellous comedy set in a lazy riverside town in the Deep South, with Buster as the foppish, city-educated boy who returns home to prove a grave disappointment to his father, a burly steamboat captain looking for stout filial support, and reluctantly joins him in his efforts to fight off a wealthy rival threatening to take over the river. Hilarious, of course, with both delicately observed jokes and energetically athletic stuntwork coursing through the movie. But what really delights is the detailed depiction of small town life, plus Keaton's comic awareness of his own persona; a sequence in which he and his father are buying a hat to replace his wimpy beret is a model of film comedy, played, remarkably, direct to camera. And the final masterstroke is the cyclone sequence, in which the entire town is destroyed but Buster remains miraculously untouched.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A collection of Jarman's 1972-74 home footage of friends superimposed around and over 1980 footage of a 'car trip to Avebury'. The 'effects' were all architected at the Super-8 stage, before the arty-fact achieved its final 16mm form. It features recurrent themes: a figure at a typewriter who may/may not be composing/dreaming the experience; slow cavortings by would-be mythopoeic figures (i.e. naked folk); flames; dunes; a woman swinging her skirt; a couple dancing; lots of robed and masked movers; knockoff plaster heads after the Grecian; and a depiction of angst that could easily be mistaken for an Anadin commercial. Mitigating against that sort of mistake is the soundtrack music by Throbbing Gristle (i.e. much electronic doodling with swells of 'meaningful' sound as a persistent shuffler of Tarot cards discovers an antique key and waves it at the viewer). Influences are legion here: Tai Chi movement, Murnau's <i>Nosferatu</i>, the wonders of the colour Xerox machine, Windscale-style protective clothing, Alan Alan's Holborn magic shop, and thermography. But, alas, zilch emerges from them; indeed, Jarman's genuine imagination as a designer seems totally in abeyance. Over fifty minutes, it's just not possible to keep your mind from wandering out to make a baloney sandwich.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Anyone afraid of the dark? When it comes to suspense cinema, the instinctive answer should be yes, if the filmmakers have been doing their jobs right. The murky corner, the unlit path, the light switch that doesnt work: these are the things to prickle the neck, while the chink of light should offer hope and relief. By the time the question is asked here, however, weve been led in a different direction. Light in Sunshine is both hero and villain, an absolute necessity and an existential threat, as it is to the projected image itself. Too little of it and youre on to a loser; too much and youre bleached to nothing.<br />Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland (The Beach) last collaborated on 28 Days Later, which up-ended convention with the introduction of fast zombies. Sunshine, set in 2057, is comparably contrary: the set-up is a climate-change crisis in which not global warming but a big chill is jeopardising the earth, while the ticking-clock narrative demands a massive bomb be detonated, not defused. The sun is dying and eight sexy astronauts (including Cillian Murphy, Rose Byrne, Michelle Yeoh and Chris Evans) have been dispatched to the heart of the solar system to kickstart the sputtering star. Their ship is the Icarus II. Now, to launch one mission named after the embodiment of hubris might seem questionable; to send another after it once its wings have been singed is surely asking for trouble, and, sure enough, our heroes soon find themselves faced with a painful dilemma, fraying nerves and one or two things that go bump<br />Theres plenty here that doesnt quite satisfy: the characterisation and dialogue feel thin; the plot veers awkwardly into slasher territory two-thirds in; and the future sensibility, which aims to meld deep-space functionality with metaphysical anxiety, is palpably derivative of Alien, Solaris, Dark Star, 2001: A Space Odyssey et al. (Theres even a Star Trek holodeck.) More impressive are the sound design and score, by Underworlds Rick Smith and Karl Hyde with John Murphy, which conjure an aptly foreboding aural backdrop for some strikingly suspenseful exterior action sequences  particular stand-outs are a suitless space-walk and a repair sortie on to the enormous curved golden shield that protects the ship from the suns rays. For these, Doyle and DoP Alvin Kchler potently alternate pitch dark and an overpowering light that constantly threatens destruction. <br />Its in the relationship between the crew and the sun that Sunshine really shines. The star is a siren here, perilously captivating; when we first see psych officer Searle (Cliff Curtis), it takes a minute to realise that his permatanned, panda-eyed complexion is the result of too many hours on the observation deck. The awesome CG solar designs (by the Moving Picture Company) make this compulsion quite understandable, forging a powerful link between them and us  we too sit gazing at the playing light, fascinated and at its mercy. Forget fantasies of global catastrophe or psycho killers: the realest violence a director can inflict on his audience is to flood the cinema with white.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>National Film School graduate Sandhya Suris delightful, seductive and deceptive documentary/home movie on her family  who, in 1965, arrived from India to settle among the brightening pastel-coloured Cortinas and mini-skirts of an otherwise bland-looking Darlington  offers enjoyment on a number of levels. First of all, it draws very movingly on her doctor fathers own charming and naive Super-8 and handycam film  the snowy Northern railway stations contrasted with bustling, stifling Indian bazaars  which she uses to compose a surprisingly revealing and full familial biography. The project is deepened by being an example of a daughter updating, contextualising and enveloping a work begun by a father, with all the  emotions and associations that can bring.</p><p>It helps, of course, that Dr Yash Suri is such a good, colourful, subject, being articulate, funny and sensitive. It is his daughters awareness, and sympathetic treatment, of his dilemmas, feelings and aspirations  expressed in the often confessional commentary he taped as accompaniment to his movies   that makes her film the more powerful as a meditation not only on her own family relationships but more generally on immigration, dislocation, patriotism, racism and what VS Naipaul called the enigma of arrival. Finally, either by virtue of its fine, discreet editing or by the directors decision to offer for public consumption what is essentially private material, Suris film  prompts a wealth of reflections, not least on the layered appeal of home movies themselves, with their intriguing, morally complex mix of unmediated intimacy and vicarious fascination. Further, it questions the justice of their subordinate relationship as artisanal primitives to their sophisticated, professional fiction film and documentary cousins as communicators and archivers of our lived reality. A lovely and thoughtful film.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Take sugar, water and lemon juice, mix it up and youve got Beiruts favourite depilatory product, a sticky goo which removes feminine hair, though not without a certain struggle. Such is the eponymous Caramel in actor-writer-director Nadine Labakis delightful first feature, an ensemble drama that explores the secret world of a Lebanese beauty parlour where the women struggle to make the best of a society which so often limits their options. <br />Labaki herself plays the thirtysomething daughter from a Christian family, who should of course be off their hands by now  except shes having a secret affair with a married man. Her Muslim co-workers meanwhile have problems of their own, including a bride desperate to hide the fact that shes not quite as virginal as her in-laws would like to believe, and a tomboy-ish type whose only apparent outlet for her sexual longings is delivering creamy scalp massage to an obviously colluding female client.<br />In surroundings of faded would-be glamour, Lebanons bloody recent history and religious tensions barely get much of a look-in, since the film prioritises personal intrigues, played out by a largely non-professional cast (the mad old ladies next door are particular treasure) who bring an impeccable authenticity to the proceedings. Labakis direction favours an affectionate amble: her screenplay throws up few genuine surprises, yet this is, frankly, a lovely film. Insisting on the bittersweet buzz of tiny female victories in the fraught milieu she describes as my Beirut, its lovingly shaped and deeply felt, a happy-sad charmer which deserves a wide audience.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Another of Alonsos minimalist parables in the form of a slow, largely mute and obscurely motivated oddyssey, this chronicles the journey of a middle-aged sailor from the Atlantic freighter on which he works, via Ushuaia, the southernmost town in Argentina, to the remote and snowy hamlet that was his birthplace. After years of travelling, this loner, who communicates with a bottle of booze more comfortably than with humans, wants to see if his mother is still alive. When he finally reaches home, he not only finds her dying and unable to recognise him, but discovers that he has a sister he never knew existed, a young woman lost in her own sad and abused world. The imagery is meticulous, the pacing carefully measured, and the mood generally melancholy and enigmatic. Whether the film adds up to more than the some of its parts is moot; Alonso certainly seems keen not to give away any superflous information.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This tough, impassive, marvellous second feature from young Chilean Pablo Larran exhibits a candour and keen eye for its lower depths milieu worthy of Pasolini at his most austere and non-judgmental. Set in, and partly intended as an allegory of, the dictatorial reign of Pinochet in 1978, its a sympathetic portrait of an unsympathetic, even unredeemable character, Ral (Alfredo Castro). This 52 year old is a calm but psychopathically violent thief whos obsessed with the disco hero Tony Manero played by John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever. Shot entirely hand-held, sometimes jump-cut and out of focus, and constructed as an informational jigsaw, Larrans movie follows his evasive quarry through the wasteground, scrapyards, apartment blocks and run-down cinemas and cafs of Santiago as he prepares for his appearance on a daytime TV audition show aiming to find Chiles own Tony Manero.<br />This is a film where, if anything, the execution exceeds the idea. In as far as the script proposes interesting parallels between the distorting excesses and temporary impunity of the murderous Pinochet regime and the actions and amoral behaviour of its main protagonist, such ambitions also threaten to rigidify and overwhelm the impressive character study and abandon the movies intriguing dramatic centre. Thankfully, not least through impressive, company-wide low-key performances  including a standout central one  and dextrous and discreet direction, the films original, tragic and bleakly humorous vision shines out, definitely marking out Larran as a talent to watch.]]></review>

Camadulle plays hefty thirtysomething metalhead Jara, whose routine as a nightman in a Montevideo supermarket is livened by the sight of Svarcass fresh-faced cleaner Julia on his security monitors. Unable to speak his mind, Jara takes to following his intended around the city, though his approach is more guardian angel than lustful predator. Morally skewed but always compelling, Gigante builds a slight but wholly convincing portrait of a damaged but sympathetic character struggling for self-improvement.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Scott Pilgrim vs the World might be a US studio movie and have cost more than three times the combined budgets of Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, but for British director Edgar Wright its no huge leap from Spaced, the 90s TV series which made his name, to this. Like Spaced, Scott Pilgrim trades in the messy lives of twentysomething slackers and springs from the world of the comic book. The characters in Spaced often felt like they tripped off the pages of a graphic novel (and Simon Peggs Tim was a fledgling comic artist), while the original Scott Pilgrim was the hero of a six-volume Canadian comic-book series published between 2004 and this year.<br />Scott Pilgrim also has a similar relationship to realism and fantasy as Spaced: what we get are down-to-earth observations on everyday lives explained with wild flights of visual and narrative fancy, with plenty of nods to films and TV shows, loud music and daring edits.<br />Whether you like or just admire Scott Pilgrim will probably rest with how you feel about Scott, as played by Hollywoods favourite nerd, Michael Cera. Scott is the 22-year-old jobless bass player in a garage band called Sex Bob-omb and is the kind of role that Cera regularly plays. But hes also likeable, adorable at times, and free of the super-cool jive-talking that mars films like Juno. Hes self-centred and emotionally childish, but no more, we think, than most of us, and we enjoy the company of his friends, especially his vicious gay flatmate (Kieran Culkin). It means that when the frosty, unreachable Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) enters his life and he gives his try-hard younger girlfriend Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) the brush-off, were running along with him.<br />Which is handy because most of the film invites us to take a trip in Scotts head, a place heavily influenced by computer games.Ramona warns that hell have to defeat her seven evil exes before they can get together  a classic gaming challenge  but the way the film flows between dream and reality, straight drama and crazy flourishes, makes it clear that its mostly happening in Scotts mind. <br />And so the seven battles come one by one, complete with on-screen point scoring like an arcade game. Two fights stand out: Scotts showdown with Lucas Lee (Chris Evans), a film star making a movie in Toronto, and his dispersal of a vegan rock star (Brandon Routh). The later battles are a bit less engaging, and its a relief when one of Scotts adversaries turns out to be two: a pair of twins.<br />Scott Pilgrim feels like Ghost World in its honouring of young people with spikey, interesting personalities. There are hints of Woody Allen in its navel-gazing. And theres a dash of The Matrix in its sneaky affection for pyrotechnics. It could have been a noisy, flashy mess, but luckily its got heart, which makes it feel fun and unique, and more like a lo-fi, endearing mess instead.]]></review>

An amateur jockey (well, none of them professionals can speak proper) tries to discover who is nobbling the favourite for the National (well, they do say that racing attracts the worst of every class). Seems he's having an affair with the wife of a racehorse owner and getting a bit on the side with a masseuse. But it's OK. They both help him to go and win the Grand National. Despite a few concessions to our times, and a potentially promising subject, the film manages nothing in the way of suspense, insight or entertainment.

      <review><![CDATA[Since its release in 1927, Fritz Langs epic modern fable has only been available in truncated form. Even with an extra 25 minutes, this restored version isnt entirely complete, but its the closest were likely to get, and its a triumph. The added material doesnt yield a fundamentally different picture, but amplifies its strengths, the narrative finally proving as compelling as the films ambitious idealism, production design and special effects always were. <br />Set in a future city where a sliver of gilded society lives atop a mountain of subterranean labour, Metropolis sends the city leaders son on an odyssey to the depths in pursuit of saintly workers advocate Maria. Meanwhile, her evil robot doppelgnger is set loose on a mission to corrupt and destroy the city. (Brigitte Helms amazing, freaky double performance is a major asset.) <br />Building on earlier science fiction and endlessly influential on later works, Langs film is a mammoth marvel, fusing modernism and expressionism, art deco and Biblical spectacle, Wagnerian bombast, sentimental Marxism and religiose millenarianism. Sit close to a big screen and submit to the machine.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A documentary record of Talking Heads in concert, using material from three shows in Hollywood, December '83. Apart from what artifice the Heads themselves allow on stage, Demme restricts himself to a cool, almost classic style, with the camera subservient to the action. Building from David Byrne performing a solo acoustic 'Psycho Killer', to the full nine-piece leaping through 'Take Me to the Water', its distinction is more what it omits than what it includes. Tacky rock theatre razzle is stripped down to humorously 'minimal' conceits of staging, lighting and presentation. Apart from a few moments of incongruous boogieing, the allegedly over- intellectual Heads are revealed to be human, warm-hearted, and possessed of a sizeable humour. A quietly large achievement.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The emperorthat is, George Lucasshould be most pleased. <i>Fanboys, </i>a sweaty, strenuously overgeeked comedy about <i>Star Wars</i> obsessives (made by an unaffiliated team of filmmakers, but with Lucass blessing and original sound effects), is free advertising bordering on a b.j. More pivotally, the movie rolls back the clock to a happier, preJar Jar moment: the autumn of 1998, when expectations were high for the following summers <i>The Phantom Menace,</i> even among those not living in a nostalgia bubble.</p><p>These twentysomething characters do live in that bubble, however, crashing Halloween parties in full stormtrooper regalia and happily lolling in a smelly universe of video games, comics and Moms garage (whoops, carriage house). <i>Fanboys</i> cant bring itself to poke too much fun at its benign heroes, and when the sweet-faced Linus (Marquette) is revealed to have terminal cancer, he and his buddies pile into the R2-topped van of Hutch (Fogler, doing the shouty Jack Black thing) and depart from their Ohio suburb. Their mission: infiltrate Lucass Bay Area Skywalker Ranch for an illegal peek at the prequel.</p><p>At the risk of incurring some serious Jedi wrath, lets just say that youve seen better road movies, ones that dont resort to yet another accidental traipse into a gay bar or mistaken-hooker-inLas Vegas scene. (Vegas, guys?) Cameos by Billy Dee Williams and Carrie Fisher make a certain sense, but casting an actor as the hirsute Web pundit Harry Knowles borders on cringeworthy. I can hear his beard! whispers femme geek (and love interest in waiting) Kristen Bell as a docile aide receives Lucass orders by phone. The line hints at a more savage comedy about artistic ego, one that couldnt be made in this galaxy.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Davis, impeccable as usual, turns the sow's ear of Hollywood's notion of a repressed spinster (remove the glasses and lo! a beauty) into something like a silk purse. Great stuff as a worldly-wise psychiatrist (Rains at his smoothest) recommends a cruise, and bitter-sweet shipboard romance soars with an unhappily married architect (Henreid, suavely performing the archetypal two-cigarette trick). The women's weepie angle gets to be a bit of a slog later on, but it is all wrapped up as a mesmerically glittering package by Rapper's direction, Sol Polito's camerawork, and Max Steiner's lushly romantic score.

      <review><![CDATA[Dogs left by summer vacationers gang together, run wild, and terrorise an out-of-season island resort. Somewhere inside <i>The Pack</i> a modestly good movie struggles to find expression. But Robert Clouse's script (from Dave Fisher's novel) is almost indecently hasty in turning the characters into dog food, and his direction is monotonously relentless in its pursuit of the requisite thrills. Occasional set pieces work - a woman trapped in a car, for instance - but little is done to string them together. It's a pity that Joe Don Baker's strangely reticent hero isn't allowed greater dimension, and that stalwarts like Shull and Armstrong are given so little to do.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Showing at the NFT as part of a two-month season of his work, The Dead was the last picture to be directed by John Huston. It was a family affair: written by Hustons son Tony, it features daughter Angelica among its ensemble cast. And as if to complete the personal, valedictory air of the movie, its a near word-for-word adaptation of a short story by James Joyce, hero writer of the country that Huston called home for much of his life.<br />Like its literary source, The Dead is a beguiling chamber piece that seizes on the conflict between public and private lives. Huston immerses us in a dinner party at a well-to-do Dublin home in 1904. Our hosts are two ageing sisters, Kate and Julia Morkan, and their young niece,  Mary Jane. The mood is lively: a friendly drunk, Freddy Malins, joins his frail mother; the house-servant, Lily, is continually flustered; and well-liked writer Gabriel Conroy (Donal McCann) attends with his contained wife, Gretta (Anjelica Huston), and gives a witty speech to the assembled reps of Dublins beau monde. The whirl is social, and Huston cuts between conversations. There are hints of lost dreams, not least when Hustons camera wanders upstairs and rummages among Julias belongings, but most of the film is an easy dose of chat and dance. Its only in the final act that Huston  and Joyce  leave this jolly gathering and ride back to a hotel room with the Conroys. Once there, Gretta punctuates Gabriels self-satisfaction with a memory that turns the film on its head.<br />Fans of Patrice Chreaus Gabrielle should respond particularly well to both Hustons superb handling of this interior drama and Joyces pointed lament for love lost or never found.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An open wound of a girl, Susanna Kaysen (Ryder), puts up only minimal resistance when her parents bundle her off to a mental asylum. There she meets a pack of similarly troubled souls, led by rebel Lisa (Jolie). In this glossy adaptation of Kaysen's '60s memoir, it's the beauty of the two leads you first notice. Jolie has a flaming, slithery, childlike presence. During a group outing, Susanna is accosted by the wife of her former lover, unleashing Lisa's protective rage. As the humiliated woman backs away, the girls roar with delight and we feel like roaring with them. It's not just Susanna who's being seduced here, it's us. Does it matter that every time Jolie's offscreen the film wilts a little? Ryder should be perfect as the bright spark; her lines are sharp as a knife. There's a gap, however, between what we hear and what we see. Ryder's too wide-eyed and cutesy, and when we see her with nurse Valerie (Goldberg), we know it's only a matter of time before they start hugging. As Lisa's dark side turns pitch black, she hisses to Susanna: 'You need me to play the villain, 'cos it makes you the good guy' - a clever attempt by Lisa to wriggle free of her own guilt. As a summary of Ryder's schtick, though, it's bang on.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Fed by comic tributaries perhaps, but Pee-Wee Herman comes over as a delightful original. It's a balancing act, and he doesn't put a '50s preppy white buckskin wrong. He lives in a house which is a Heath Robinsonish turn in itself, and responds to his environment with all the restraint of a streaker in a carwash. A nasty boy steals his beloved bicycle. Pee-Wee gives chase, taking in a lot of America's tourist map and winding up in Hollywood (which buys his adventure, and we see their version too). Dreamlike situations hover on the edge of unease (a meeting with a waitress in the mouth of a model dinosaur, pursuit by her giant boyfriend waving a caveman's bone), and there's a wonderfully sustained gag in which Pee-Wee rescues animals from a burning pet shop, nervously stalling the snakes. The score works edgily against the comedy, and the dream sequences are just this side of Dali. Pee-Wee himself comes from the school of acting that usually sits under a bubble - Rage, Foiled, Idea - in a cartoon. Truly weird and wonderfully addictive.]]></review>

The sets, costumes (by Cecil Beaton), photography, and Hermes Pan's choreography are all sumptuously impressive, and Harrison makes a fine, arrogant Professor Higgins; but Hepburn is clearly awkward as the Cockney Eliza in the first half, and in general the adaptation is a little too reverential to really come alive.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Two years earlier, several Walt Disney animators (including Bluth) left the company to set up on their own, complaining that Disney was lowering its animation standards and heading for the dreadful cut-price techniques that are pumped out daily on children's television. This is their first animation feature, and visually they make their point well. It's a spectacular return to the shimmering, mesmerising deep-focus animation associated with Disney's classic period: a marvellous use of lighting to create atmosphere, dew-drops glisten from every tree, and the villains are as primally terrifying as cartoon villains should be. The choice of material (Robert O'Brien's novel <i>Mrs Frisby and the Rats of NIMH</i>) is less fortunate, since it lacks the wonder of early Disney, and the mouse heroine is far too insipid and twee. It's still a pretty effective family film, though.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[On paper at least, Disneys latest character creation  a chicken with teeth  is only marginally less irritating to look at than Barney the bloody Dinosaur. Thank heavens, then, that the production team elected to give him an engagingly droll adult voice (Zach Braff) and not a twee Tweety Pie-style twitter, or you too may have felt the urge to lob grenades at the screen. The film is being promoted as Disneys first ever foray into computer animation. Its not an auspicious start: the mostly unimaginative characters and backgrounds on display here are no better rendered than those in Pixars first Toy Story film; and how long ago was that? Indeed, judging by the generally uncreative level of detail all round, its perhaps just as well that Disney has recently bought Pixar from Steve Apple Jobs. The content of the film is no great shakes, either: the cry wolf storyline simply isnt strong enough to survive an 80-minute running-time and, aside from a few amusing witticisms and a couple of well-oiled film references (yawn!), most of the jokes fall flat. One can only assume its target audience will be a little easier to please.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[What with the population explosion, ongoing pollution, global warming and the depletion of natural resources, the planet we call home is not exactly in tip-top condition and a response is urgently required. <br />Such are the headlines from this latest cinematic attempt to raise our eco-consciousness, narrated and produced by Leonardo DiCaprio, whose presence is presumably intended to lure in youthful audiences for an altogether earnest if slightly draining barrage of information. The content could hardly be more important, but this increasingly familiar story puts the onus on the filmmakers to present their argument in a fresh and accessible manner.<br />Their experience limited to a couple of environmentalist shorts, the co-directors slightly struggle with the longer form. While An Inconvenient Truth was criticised as an illustrated lecture, Al Gores delivery was much more charismatic than Leos stiff line readings, and that films single voice a much more approachable prospect than the throng of over 50 miscellaneous experts (Stephen Hawking and Mikhail Gorbachev the star names) assembled on this occasion. <br />In visual terms too, its a cut-and-paste affair, moving unimaginatively between talking heads and fairly generic images of landscape or industrialisation, and edited for pace in a manner that frequently feels rushed. <br />True, the philosophical musing on human self-perception as a species apart is a useful attempt at explaining our arrogant destruction of our environment, yet the film still tiptoes around the key issue that change wont come unless the US elects a president committed to action. Overall, the subject matter makes The 11th Hour significant, not its rather underwhelming execution.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[From Marcus Nispel, director of the half-decent Texas Chain Saw Massacre re-make, comes a thoroughly indecent re-imagining of Sean S Cunninghams formula-fixing slasher movie: psycho killer slays obnoxious, dope-smoking, promiscuous college kids. Strictly speaking, this offers a pick n mix selection from the first three movies, with the first two reprised as a campfire tale and an extended, gory pre-title sequence. As such, it treads a fine line between satisfying fans of the original (and its sequels), and attracting those who werent even born in 1980. <br />The story of Jason Voorhees and his mad mother having been swiftly disposed of, the sack-hooded Jason starts terrorising visitors to the abandoned Camp Crystal Lake summer camp. His first bunch of victims duly dispatched, the film re-boots itself and flashes forward a few months. Trent, Jenna and their pals are partying at his fathers swanky lakeside home; Clay is searching for his missing sister Whitney. All of them end up on the sharp end of the now hockey-masked Jasons machete. <br />Early on, a woman is burned alive inside her sleeping bag, but the subsequent kills are standard fare. As is the would-be knowing dialogue: 'Go to the tool shed, its just down the path.' The only innovations are Jasons labyrinthine, subterranean lair and the revival of the originals adolescent obsession with titillating nudity and sex  topless water-skiing, vigorous coupling and a priceless line about 'perfect nipple placement'. Stunt man Derek Mears is fine as the indestructible Jason, but this is dull, unimaginative stuff.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Theres a revolutionary conceit behind Humpday, and its not the tawdry question of what would happen if two straight dudes had sex on camera. If all Lynn Sheltons film offered was a crude will they, wont they? dramatic striptease, the movie would soon grow tiresome. Which is where the real high concept comes in: what if we took the laidback, stunted heroes of a Judd Apatow comedy and stranded them in the too-cool-for-school environs of a zero-budget mumblecore romance? And then got them to have sex on camera?<br />Office drone Ben (Mark Duplass) is happy with his humdrum existence until he attends a party with long-lost buddy Andrew (Joshua Leonard). Eager to prove he can still cut loose, Ben agrees to take part in an upcoming DIY porn film festival: having sex with Andrew.<br />Sheltons sardonic eye for the rituals of masculine bonding is unerring: as the pressure on our heroes builds, the deal develops from a stoned bet into a bizarre test of manhood. The characters are wholly believable: is Andrew, with his globetrotting past and smooth line with the ladies really more manly than homebody Ben, with his picket fence and steady income? But what finally lifts Humpday above macho junk like The Hangover is its all-inclusive warmth: for all their adolescent self-delusion, Shelton truly loves these characters. And after 90 minutes, so will you.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A sleek surgical thriller with disgust-inducing coprophiliac affectations, writer-director Tom Sixs is indeed six of one and half a dozen of the other. Abducted and drugged by the cadaverous Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser), two female American tourists Lindsay (Ashley C Williams) and Jenny (Ashlynn Yennie) become part of a deranged medical experiment. Sutured together, mouth to anus, with male Japanese abductee Katsuro (Akihiro Kitamura), they form the mid- and tail segment of the surgeons prototype human centipede. Unfortunately, once the ungainly, composite creature has been created, there is nowhere for the film to go. Repeated escape attempts, a visit by two suspicious cops and some creepy, gliding camera movements generate a degree of suspense; but by failing to explore the potential of the Cronenbergian body horror elements, Six substitutes cheap thrills and self-conscious sick-making for genuinely disturbing dread. Nevertheless, the slab-faced Laser makes a striking impression as the former separator of Siamese Twins, and although the blood-bath finale seems to preclude a sequel, the films success at horror film festivals means that the idea has legs. Part two, Full Sequence, is already being made. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Enjoyable as it is, in its affectionate way, theres a feeling of superfluousness about this latest spoof of the 70s-era Blaxploitation flick, directed by Scott Sanders from a story idea by its muscular star, Michael Jai White. White, with regulation Afro and half-moon tache, makes for a solid, relatively camp-free, avenger. He plays a flashback-prone, ex-CIA baadasssss, who, out to avenge his murdered brother, clean up the streets and free orphanages from crack, finds that taking on the dastardly, penis-shrinking malevolence of The Man takes him  believe it, brother!  to the very centre of the white establishment. Running closer to pastiche than parody, the comedy is muted. Youre meant to laugh at the dated jive-brother threads, the period split-screen, whip-pan, stock-mismatched cinematic and televisual stylings and the uninflected embrace of period clich. Meanwhile, the kung-fu-orientated action scenes are unexceptional and many of the OTT cameos (Arsenio Hall as gangster Tasty Freeze) may prove beyond the familarity of non-US audiences or retro-specialists. That said, the portentous dialogue, two-track-recorded soundtrack (by Adrian Younge) and eager performances are all highly diverting.<br />]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[French filmmaker Franois Ozon has taken a couple of odd turns lately: Angel was an English-language, period literary adaptation, while Ricky, which was never released here, was a grim slice of realism mixed with fantasy in which a baby grows wings and flies around a housing estate. It was daring but disastrous.<br />The 42-year-old Parisians latest returns him to safer and more familiar territory. Like Under the Sand, 5x2 and Time to Leave before it, Le Refuge is an intimate contemporary drama that plays out on bourgeois, metropolitan terrain and concerns itself with examining one or two people and their relationship to love or death. Its blessed with a mesmerising performance from Isabelle Carr who was six or seven months pregnant for most of the shoot and appears in nearly every scene. Its short and even slight, more of an observational short story of a film than a rich novel, but its entrancing and moving nonetheless.<br /><br />We begin in Paris, but soon, as so often with Ozons films, find ourselves dragged willingly to the sea. Mousse (Carr) and Louis (Melvil Poupaud) are heroin addicts, and Ozon invites us to share the piercing of their arms and necks  as a director, Ozon worships bodies  before tragedy strikes and Mousse is left alone and pregnant. An awkward encounter with Louiss haughty mother informs her choice to leave Paris for the coast, where she borrows a house. Soon shes joined by Louiss brother Paul (Louis-Ronan Choisy), himself more of an exile from his background than he seems. <br />Most of the film chronicles the short period of time  a week, maybe two  that Mousse and Paul spend together in this house. Their interests collide, as when they go to a beach or a club together, and diverge, as when Paul stumbles into a local affair or Mousse encounters strangers with differing attitudes to pregnancy, such as the lecturing woman on the beach or the warm seducer in a bar. Partly, you feel that Ozon just wants to portray a pregnancy up close  and the shots of Carr on the beach or in the bath are fascinating for their uniqueness: its refreshing not to watch an actress with a pillow stuffed up her jumper. But were also gently reminded that this is the pregnancy of someone who is an addict, who is without a partner and who is in the throes of grief, even if none of those are always apparent. <br />As such, most of Le Refuge unfolds in an ethereal sort of limbo space  something of which were sharply reminded by a brief, Parisian epilogue that will no doubt have audiences debating its credibility and its rights and wrongs.]]></review>

Blonde, shapely and good at fixing things, shes like a DIY Barbie (with wings). Here, Tinker is part of a Mean Girls-style bratpack who spend summercamp in Ye Olde England, near a cottage inhabited by fairy-loving Lizzy and the father she calls Father. A lot. A cute fairy-girl friendship follows, with vicarious fun for little girls who like dressing up in pink tutus. Theres a particularly enjoyable flying sequence that has a dreamlike air reminiscent of Tinkers origins. Animation-wise, the humans look like dolls, which makes them hard to relate to. And the plots wrapped up far too simply  the rescue of the title is missable. Still, the central character has enough pluck and personality to sell a gazillion Tinker trinkets.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Daniel Stamms frustrating faux-documentary about a charlatan exorcist confronted by a seemingly genuine case of demonic possession sustains its intriguing conceit until the last ten minutes, when a contrived generic ending pops up out of nowhere and erases all of its troubling ambiguities. Its a crushing disappointment as the intimate immediacy of the preceding scenes is emotionally involving, psychologically disturbing and often downright terrifying.<br />The Reverend Cotton Marcus, a charismatic evangelical preacher who has lost his faith, invites a documentary film crew to record and expose the truth about his final exorcism. Even when confronted by 16-year-old Nell, the daughter of a fundamentalist Louisiana farmer, the lapsed believer is sceptical: fragile and naive, Nell appears more psychologically distressed than demonically possessed. Since the death of her mother six years before, Nell has been locked way by her strict father and fiercely protective brother. There are whispers about a secret boyfriend and a faint suspicion of incest but Nell is initially calmed by the reverends hollow religious ministrations. Then the demons return with a vengeance. <br />The credibility of faux-documentary filmmaking relies on clear plotting and convincing, semi-improvised acting. German-born director Stamm is well served in both departments: Huck Botko and Andrew Garlands script toys with our scepticism, assumptions and fears, and Ashley Bell, as the shockingly feral Nell, and Patrick Fabian, as the charming showman priest, are both utterly believable. Sadly, the promise of the initial set-up and the atmospheric intensity of the central scenes are squandered by the ending.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The main reason why Keaton is funnier and infinitely more 'modern' than Chaplin is that his movies are written, directed and shot as movies, never as excuses for comedy and/or pathos. This was his second feature and first full-length masterpiece, a story about the innocent inheritor of an old feud between Southern families, who carelessly starts dating the girl from the other family. The period setting (1831, the early days of rail travel) is made integral to the action, and all the laughs spring directly from the narrative and the characters. Buster's climactic rescue of his sweetheart from a waterfall is one of his most daringly acrobatic (and most celebrated) gags.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Almodvar spins a serpentine story of a sentimental miseducation through a virtuoso spectrum of hues, from the gaudiest camp to the glassiest <i>noir</i>. A tortuous love triangle refracted through three time-periods and myriad layers of make-believe, it's also full of autobiographical flourishes and teases, starting in 1980 with the character of a New Wave film director, Enrique Goded (Martnez), rummaging through the tabloids for inspiration. Into his office steps a young man (Garca Bernal) who claims to be his old school friend and first love Ignacio Rodriguz, bearing a screenplay that riffs on their abuse and separation at the hands of the predatory Father Manolo (Gimnez-Cacho) at Catholic school during the repressive '60s, and the idea of revenge wrought during the country's liberated late-'70s knees-up. Enrique is tantalised, but as he delves into his visitor and his story, he finds that the priest's seeds of perfidy have born strange and terrible fruit. Packing the homoeroticism and masquerade of his early comedies with the sleek storytelling exuberance of his recent dramas, this teeming tragedy could be taken as an index of Almodvar ministrations: transgression, provocation, compassion and flair. It's certainly his most ambitious film to date, an ever-shifting kaleidoscope in which identity, desire and power are in permanent disarray. But for Garca Bernal's quicksilver lucidity through a wild variety of guises, the film would lack any focus. As it is, it's too fractured to stoke clear empathy or steer to dramatic satisfaction. But maybe that's its point: life's end is nothing to live for. Best relish the convolutions of the journey.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A dazzling opening sequence (not for the squeamish) as a teenage vampire of today (Amplas) satisfies his bloodlust in a railway sleeper compartment. Thereafter, Romero plays fascinating games with myth and reality as he balances traditional vampire lore against medically certifiable psychosis. Fundamentally a quite serious movie, relevant to contemporary personality problems and stresses, but shot through with a wicked streak of black humour. It doesn't always come off, but Romero makes stunning use of his Pittsburgh locations to create a desolate suburban wasteland, and at its best it is rivetingly raw-edged.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A band of charmless youngsters ignore all the warnings and stumble across a psychopathic family (closer to Charles Addams than <i>Psycho</i>) in remote farmland. This abattoir of a movie boasts sledgehammers, meathooks and chainsaws, and the result, though not especially visceral, is noisy, relentless, and about as subtle as having your leg sawed off without anaesthetic. It's notable only for taking woman-in-jeopardy about as far as she can go. The three men are despatched unceremoniously, and the women (bra-less and hotpants respectively), their screams rising into orgasms of fear, are toyed with endlessly while the camera often assumes a pointedly aggressive stance. Pernicious stuff and not even true, like the ads suggested - the Ed Gein case, on which this is supposedly based, bears little relation.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ang Lees adaptation of an Annie Proulx short story arrives amid much chatter from awards-season soothsayers and pundits who have slapped the easy tag of gay cowboy movie on this sensitive, intelligent and pleasingly traditional film. Certainly its two male protagonists, Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger), two free-and-easy 19-year-olds, tend sheep together in rural Wyoming. They favour denim, live close to the land and enjoy  briefly  a loving, sexual relationship. But theres little in this film to excite either John Wayne fans or devotees of Warhols Lonesome Cowboys. Instead, the films themes of forbidden love, lost opportunity, marital deception and romantic honesty are quite accessible, mainstream even. The revolution is all off-screen: what ultimately makes Brokeback Mountain a radical project is that its set to become the first bona fide, well-made and commercially successful gay weepie to emerge from Hollywood. <br />Jack and Ennis meet on a Wyoming mountainside one summer when both are employed to watch over the flock of a local farm baron (Randy Quaid). Lee indulges wide shots of flowing rivers, travelling sheep, wispy clouds and mountain vistas to canonise the pairs experience on Brokeback Mountain. He threatens to over-sweeten us with the shallow beauty of a Marlboro commercial or Wrangler advert until, one night on the mountain, a drunken Ennis spits on his hand, turns Jack over and lights the fuse on an on-off love affair that will stretch painfully over two decades but never escape the macho strictures of the rural worlds to which they belong. Both marry; both have kids; both meet occasionally over 20 years for the odd tryst disguised as a fishing trip. For Jack and Ennis, Brokeback Mountain is more than a place; its a symbol of what could have been, a state of mind, an unattainable nirvana. <br />Brokeback got us good, sighs Jack to Ennis as their strained friendship floats through the years, forever secret, barely defined, hardly spoken. Always taking his cue from Proulxs original story (a marvel of epic economy), Lee and his screenwriters Larry McMurty (The Last Picture Show) and Diana Ossana present just enough of the pairs married, post-Brokeback lives to remind us of the conservative and traditional nature of their domestic lives. <br />But what makes Brokeback Mountain more interesting than a well-meaning time capsule of period values are the subtle differences in character that Lee carves between Jack and Ennis. Jack is more exuberant, more romantic, a dreamer who rides the rodeo and hatches impossible plans for him and Ennis to live together. Ennis is a puritan, unadventurous and afraid of himself; he takes solace in violence, holds back emotionally and creates excuses for the stagnation that defines his life. The film is Enniss tragedy; it becomes painfully obvious that he left his soul on Brokeback Mountain. Its a tough act to witness and one that Heath Ledger handles superbly, delivering an increasingly sad, mumbling and desperate performance that smacks of loneliness and alienation. And all because the boy loves the boy but barely knows what such love means, let alone possesses the tools with which to act on it.<br />What we have here is acutely calibrated storytelling. Nothing is wasted. The pacing is calm, the mood sombre, and the adaptation is both respectful and imaginative. Lee retains the taut ease of Proulxs prose, allowing him to cover a long period of time (about 20 years) without lessening the tragedy at the heart of the tale or offering episodic biographies. Very little is added to Proulxs story; the films screenwriters take smart inspiration from a line here or a comment there, spinning them into well-placed new scenes. <br />Brokeback Mountain deserves all the awards and acclaim that its bound to gather in the next couple of months. Its painful stuff, moving and intelligent. Lee has taken a story of gay love and placed it where it should be  in the mainstream. Hes delivered a beautifully crafted film to boot.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Okay, hands up who would have guessed that a warmly nostalgic, near-silent comedy about the decline of the music hall in post-war Europe would be one of the years most immaculately constructed, heartbreaking releases? With his remarkable new film The Illusionist, French-born artisan Sylvain Chomet (writer-director of 2003s Belleville Rendez-Vous) joins the lofty ranks of John Lasseter, Brad Bird and Hayao Miyazaki as one of the masters of modern feature animation. <br />The film is adapted from an unfilmed script by the late Jacques Tati that some think was intended as a bashful apologia to Sophie, his daughter. Its a gorgeous visual poem that explores the practicalities of following ones dreams at the expense of parental responsibility. It gently circles a shambling stage illusionist named Tatischeff (Tatis real surname) as he tours his creaky act from neon-lit Paris to drizzly Edinburgh with a carnivorous white rabbit in tow. While performing in a far-flung Scottish pub, a naive young lass named Alice latches on to his coat tails and stows away with him to the capital. She believes he has real magical powers.<br />Alice and Tatischeffs wordless rapport is beautifully orchestrated and developed  she offers him a coy peck on the cheek as he showers her with gifts, he manfully rebuffs her affection but protects her. As Tatischeff gallantly swims against the turning tide of a fickle entertainment industry, its clear Alice is an emblem of his need to succeed, as a performer and a father figure. But the seductiveness of the city and the allure of modern fashions draw Alice in her own direction, towards love and independence.<br />As much as Tatis gravity-defying saunter as M Hulot cant help but provoke a wry smile, Chomet recognises that the principal skill of his muse was as a filmmaker, and more than that, as a neurotic micro-architect of screen comedy. As such, scenes are mounted in mid or long shot and camera movement is kept to a minimum, allowing each frame to buzz with detail. Chomet recreates the streets of 1950s Edinburgh with photorealist precision, creating a veritable location-spotters dream for anyone familiar with the area. <br />Purists may moan that there is too much of a defined story for this to be a genuine Tati article, but thats only because Chomet puts his own eccentric stamp on it. Tati thought anything could be funny, and while Chomet runs with that idea as a director, he challenges it as a storyteller. The Illusionist presents a cruel world in flux, a place where people grow old and drift apart and loneliness and failure lead to tragedy. The last five minutes are almost unwatchably sad, as Alice blossoms into adulthood while Tatischeff refuses to abandon his youth. The films parting suggestion is that a neat sleight of hand may be okay in the moment, but to excel as a parent, you need more than magic.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Liam Neeson goes from releasing krakens in <i>Clash of the Titans</i>
to wearing medical Crocs in this semisuccessful horror flick, which
casts the towering performer as Eliot Deacon, a soft-spoken mortician
with the ability to talk to the recently deceased. Its never entirely
confirmed if his very particular set of skills is genuine or the
elaborate cover of a serial killer; suffice it to say that when
schoolteacher Anna Taylor (a necrolicious Christina Ricci) crosses his slab,
theres a lot of impassioned hemming and hawing about whether shes
dead or alive.</p><p>Deacon cleverly talks around the facts of her case
with the kind of mock-philosophical misdirection (Only I can see you
as you really are.) befitting the Saw films Jigsaw. Yet this bogeyman
is different: Neeson clearly relishes the role, but he never plays to
the cheap seats by going whole-hog psychotic. The characters
motivations remain tantalizingly opaque from first frame to last.</p><p>Would
that writer-director Wojtowicz-Vosloo brought the same sense of
tightrope-traversing rigor (minus mortis) to the rest of the film.
Ricci is certainly game, baring body and soul in her scenes with
Neeson. But two subplotsone involving Annas bereaved boyfriend, Paul
(Justin Long), the other one of her death-obsessed studentsact as damaging
narrative deadweight. This is one case where theres more life in the
morgue than out.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It feels like Phillip Noyces flavourless spy thriller has been precision-built as a femme-fronted riposte to the suits-and-boots male machismo of the Bond franchise. Taken in that context, you cant deny that it succeeds because its every bit as dour, emotionless and nonsensical as Quantum of Solace. Angelina Jolie adopts a licence to pout and a small ocean of hair dye as the slippery, indestructible Evelyn Salt. Shes a svelte CIA operative married to a lovey-dovey arachnologist (arent they all?) whose loyalty is thrown into question when the Cold War flares up again and shes implicated in a Russian conspiracy to have the US vapourised.<br /><br />Its a pulpy, weakly political yarn that strains to maintain momentum by concealing Salts true allegiance, although small, not very subtle details (Why the hell didnt she just shoot me back there?!) essentially reveal which flag shes flying. Australian director Noyce has pedigree in this field, specifically his 90s Jack Ryan movies Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger, yet the focus here is less on creating a credible set of characters and motives than on manufacturing an excuse to have Jolie leapfrog between high-speed lorries. There is the odd moment of exhilaration, such as a vertiginous shot of Salt clinging to the side of an apartment block having evaded her captors, though mostly Noyce demonstrates little feel for movement, rhythm or flow, often allowing fights, chases and ideas to deflate just at the point you feel they should be hitting a higher gear.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Revenge of the Nerds-style wish-fulfilment fantasy is fused with Columbine massacre-like reality in Joey Stewarts self-consciously controversial teen horror movie. Alls fair in sex and high school, asserts an uber-babe straight out of Heathers and one of the ruling clique who make life hell for unpopular misfits. But after years of bullying, a group of outcasts exact a cruel, calculated revenge. Having spiked the punch at a costume party, windbag leader Dane (Marc Donato), his emo girl sidekick Emily (Lindsay Seidel) and three masked loser pals subject their tormentors to some personalised torture and humiliation  one girls flawless face is smeared with caustic face cream. Despite its courting of controversy, The Final has nothing interesting or insightful to say about the corrosive effects of bullying. Also, while the set-up is confidently handled, and there are some sly nods to Takashi Miikes Audition and the Saw films, Jason Kabolatis prolix script is marred by redundant sub-plots, logical inconsistencies and preachy monologues that state the obvious: I am the monster you made me, declares Dane.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The premise is a staple of teen romance: separate hero and heroine so that there's plenty of yearning but no danger of any squelchy business. The difference here is that the young couple are allowed a brief but memorable moment of on-screen passion; and the thing that comes between them is death. Swayze, he of the acting ability of a corpse, is ideal as the murdered yuppie who learns how to use his ghostly powers to foil a dastardly plot; Moore, as the grieving girlfriend, displays the animation of a dishcloth. Luckily, Whoopi Goldberg is on hand to ham it up gloriously in abetting the lovers with her newly discovered psychic powers. But the real credit for turning a minor mystic romance into one of the most enjoyable movies of the year rests on an excellent script by Bruce Joel Rubin, and on the surprisingly sure direction of Jerry Zucker. He borrows a roving camera from Sam Raimi, a penchant for shooting into and through solid matter from David Lynch; and the dissolves between scenes cleverly echo Swayze's ability to walk through walls.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[With Robin Williams as neurologist Oliver Sacks - here Dr Sayer - and De Niro as Leonard Lowe, the most afflicted Parkinson's case on the ward, we are deep in <i>Rain Man</i> territory (a terrain notable for its squashiness) in another homage to catatonia. The patients, frozen in what Pinter called 'A Kind of Alaska' in his play about the case, have been sealed off for decades. The good doctor treats them with L-Dopa, despite official hostility (Heard), with miraculous results. We don't get the euphoric explosions of libido detailed in Ry Cooder's 'What Makes Granny Run', nor do we get the depressions you might expect from all those wasted years. We do get Dr Sayer and Leonard relating, and - briefly - Leonard's diffident romance with a visitor (Miller) before he reverts. Dexter Gordon, one of the patients, was actually dying and looks it, which is something of a visual bring-down for the phony charades. Penny Marshall presses all the easy buttons, Williams bumbles loveably, and De Niro shakes his chassis to bits. Dramatically, it's a twin-tub, with a big slot on top to pour in the caring.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An irredeemable criminal exacts his revenge on the family of a lawyer who put him away. This supremely nasty thriller - originally severely cut by the British censor - boasts great credentials: a source in John D MacDonald's novel <i>The Executioners</i>, Mitchum as the sadistic villain (a bare-chested variant on his <i>Night of the Hunter</i> role), Peck as the epitome of threatened righteousness, seedy locations in the Southern bayous, and whooping music by Bernard Herrmann. If director Thompson isn't quite skilful enough to give the film its final touch of class (many of the shocks are just too planned), the relentlessness of the story and Mitchum's tangibly sordid presence guarantee the viewer's quivering attention.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When, towards the end of A Scanner Darkly, a character conspiratorially confides that the whole process is hidden behind the surface of our reality, hes talking about the industrial manufacture of narcotics, but it takes only the smallest of synaptic leaps to apply his words to the socio-politics of the world he lives in, and the production of the film itself. Closely adapted from a novel by Philip K Dick  in whose work the daily experience of future life is frequently exposed as a strategically constructed tissue of mollifying deception  Scanner is set seven years from now in a Los Angeles where a quarter of the population is dependent on the powerful and ultimately lethal mind-bender Substance D. Its a police state in which unaccountable authority is maintained through hypersurveillance and the cultivation of multiple strata of crippling paranoia, to which many citizens understandable response is a retreat from the world and even the self  a schism reflected on a formal level by a more subtle and sophisticated version of the digital rotoscoping technique Linklater used in 2001s Waking Life, whereby live-action is rendered as eerily beautiful painted animation.By turns amusing, unsettling and baffling, the skittish story centres on McDad-turned-dropout Bob Arctor (Keanu Reeves) who, in his alternative identity as a deep-cover drugs agent known as Fred, is charged with monitoring a gaggle of deadbeat D-users, including two-faced motormouth James Barris (Robert Downey, Jr), wild-eyed space cadet Ernie Luckman (Woody Harrelson), ostensibly more self-possessed dealer Donna Hawthorne (Winona Ryder) and, er, McDad-turned-dropout Bob Arctor. This Mbius strip of an assignment turns out to be pretty typical of LA, 2013, where intolerable pressures bear on atomised minds. Dicks title is a reference to the chapter in Corinthians in which St Paul suggests that, in this world, we see through a glass, darkly  an image of incomplete comprehension deployed in the service of a plea to embrace charity. That attribute is absent here: a friend in need is a cause for suspicion, the abduction of an innocent fellow-citizen a cue to look the other way. Here, there really is no such thing as society.Rather than a garish dystopia, then, Scanner offers the banality of fascism. Where other filmed Dick stories  Blade Runner, Total Recall and Minority Report being the most prominent  have gone to great lengths to fashion exotic future worlds packed with bleeding-edge eye candy, Linklater serves up a disarmingly familiar milieu with only a smattering of hi-tech magic, related to modes of perception and integrated into the animated mise en scne. Most impressive is the scramble-suit worn by Arctor-as-Fred: designed to stymie face-recognition sensors, its a constantly shifting mask of fractured features which at any one time might resemble, say, the eyes and nose of an African American girl and the jawline of an Asian grandfather. Its a local version of the rotoscoping technique with which the whole movie is stamped  a recognisable but fundamentally unreliable version of the real, its an apt expression of the pervasive uncertainty of the setting. Its also wondrously attractive, all the more so for the avoidance (with one or two exceptions) of extrovert Waking Life-style set-pieces.The casting is spot-on. Even on a good day, Reeves struggles to seem entirely certain of who he is, where he is and what hes doing there, and his air of hazy befuddlement is perfect for the increasingly cracked Arctor. That many of the rest of the cast have established track records of enthusiastic substance experimentation adds another layer. Part of Dicks point is the reduction of discourse to banality and, when Downeys Barris is on screen, the film can feel like being stuck in a lift with a crank. Even when hes not, its a very talky film: this may be the future, but its a future realised by the Linklater of Slacker and Before Sunrise, and the emphasis is on opinionated stoners in slovenly tract housing, not flying cars and laser fights. The narrative is also a slippery prospect, as scrambled and frustrating as Freds mask  but then thats only fitting for a film about fake impostors with lives that feel like movies shot on CCTV.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Kate! Leo! Sam Mendes! And a Great American Novel! The stars are aligned! All known film industry computations dictate that if you combine those two from Titanic with the British director of American Beauty and such heavyweight literary material as Richard Yatess 1961 novel about the breakdown of suburban dreams in 1950s Connecticut, then everyone involved should be drowning in gold statuettes come Oscar time. But, no, last week this film received not a single major nomination from the Academy, although Michael Shannon rightly received a Best Supporting Actor nod for a brilliant, brief performance that puts his co-stars in the shade.<br /><br />Shannon plays a wise fool, an unhinged chorus, who speaks out loud the unsayable truths that we come to share about youthful married couple Frank (Leo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet), whose marriage we observe veering from hope to tragedy. From the very beginning of the film, Mendes introduces a tussle between happiness and disappointment, leaping quickly from a jazzy, Manhattan-set scene in which the pair lock eyes on each other at a party to a few years later and a marital argument after a poor performance by April, a trained actress, in a local amateur production. Most of the film spins on this struggle between change and stasis as Frank and April struggle to be the free spirits  too special for the suburbs  they believe themselves to be. Mendes is good at identifying small, significant moments, such as the look on Frank and Aprils neighbours face when they announce their move to Paris: its as if theyve sucked all meaning out of their friends small world. <br />This is a good, thoughtful film, directed with some subtle touches by Mendes (an unpredictable director), acted with intelligence by its leads and photographed by Roger Deakins mostly to avoid suburban clichs. But overall it fails  just  to get to the heart of its main, female characters tragedy so that its climactic scenes feel hysterical rather than the culmination of all thats come before. Thomas Newmans forceful, repetitive score doesnt help either; its refrain becomes more annoying the more you hear it. Yes, we know this is sad stuff. We dont need constant reminders. <br />Winslet gives a good performance as a wife and mother desperately trying to swim against an ever-rising tide, but both she and DiCaprio are rigid at times. Theres one scene in which her character walks across her kitchen to kiss her husband like shes striding across a West End stage. Yet this niggling sense of theatricality has its upside too, adding to the idea that performance is at the root of this couples lives. <br />This is a horror film about living on the edges of self-perception. Its about people who are self-aware enough to have ideals and ambitions but at the same time not strong or daring enough to act on them. They have failings, but mostly  and this is something Mendes and his cast communicate very well  its their environment and societys values that dictate their fate. <br />This is a sobering, well-observed film that doesnt fully hit the mark but sets up enough pleasing ideas to chew on regarding ambition, marriage and ideals of how to live ones life, individually and as a couple.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Northern England, the late 70s: kids are hoovering up speed and dancing all night to obscure US soul 45s  thus a legend is born. Its no surprise to see the Northern Soul scene as a movie but this debut features inspiration stops there. Its a familiar story of a shambling young lad (Martin Compston) who comes alive at the Wigan Casino  but can he choose between the heartless blonde vixen (Nicola Burley) whose boyfriend is the dancefloor alpha male and the cheery girl next door (Felicity Jones) who teaches him the steps? Its all dismayingly formulaic and, although the period details are endearing, the film  like Compstons footwork  is too effortful to sweep us along. Director Shimmy Marcus integrates priceless archive footage and a suitably groovy soundtrack but its not enough to make the drama compelling.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>A hi-tech thriller with a human heart, offering slam-bang entertainment on a par with <i>Lethal Weapon</i> or <i>Aliens</i>. On Christmas Eve, visiting New York cop McClane (Willis) enters the high-rise LA office block where his estranged wife works, not realising that it has already being taken over by sadistic smoothie Hans Gruber (Rickman) and his ruthless terrorists. Inside the building, having taken wife (Bedelia) and celebrating colleagues hostage, the gang tries to crack open the Nakotomi corporation's computerised vault; outside, LA cops and FBI agents squabble over jurisdiction, while opportunistic TV reporters gather like jackals; it's up to McClane, having established a chance radio link with a passing patrolman (Veljohnson), to use the building's 39 empty floors, lift shafts, and heating ducts to improvise diversionary tactics. McTiernan excels in the adrenalin-inducing action scenes, staging the murderous mayhem and state-of-the-art violence as if he were born with a camera in one hand and a rocket launcher in the other..</p><p>See also:<br />Die Hard 2 <br />Die Hard With A Vengeance </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An inspirational movie from the director of <i>The Black Stallion</i>. The shock opening, however, sets a tone of emotional realism unusual for a children's film. (A car crash leaves 13-year-old Amy traumatised and her mother dead.) The ostensible (true-life) adventure - Amy is shipped to backwoods Canada to live with her eccentric sculptor/inventor father (Daniels), learns to fly a micro-light aircraft in order to reach the breeding grounds of the orphaned geese she's raised - is made a metaphor for the girl's empowerment thanks to the enabling support of her parent. It's a common enough image, but it's realised here without strain. Caleb Deschanel's cinematography is as arresting as Mark Isham's score is discreet. But the performances are key: as Amy, Anna Paquin proves again what an expressive, soulful actress she is, and Daniels' madcap dad is a winning study in hippy ingenuity and indefatigability.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This adaptation is paradoxical, a film celebrating the fruits of book-reading that's not as good as the original novel. DeVito can't resist the Hollywood touch - special effects, suspect stereotypes, crushing music - especially in the latter stages. Still, mainly he's stuck to the book, and anyway, there's scope enough in Dahl's slipstream for something worthwhile. Our heroine (Mara Wilson) is a precocious, bright, spunky young thing somehow born to mindless, amoral, stupid neanderthals. Dad (DeVito) is a crooked car dealer, Mum (Perlman) a bingo junkie; they both ignore her. When she's finally sent to school, it's as part-receipt for a used car Dad's sold to the headmistress, Miss Trunchbull (Ferris). Alas, the teaching methods of this Olympic hammer-throwing harridan are open to question - her idea of a perfect school is one with no children. DeVito's snappy, kinetic visual style fits the cartoon feel of the material, and the cast is great. It's a modern-day pantomime about childhood solidarity and self-empowerment: the real joy here is the view of generational war, the children's assumption of zero tolerance for injustices inflicted by absurd adults, and the recognition that the big meanies should be punished, by fair means or foul.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The new century is shaping up to be a fine time for world animation, not least for child's eye features packed with the old fashioned virtues of fantasy, adventure, ingenuity and derring-do - and more or less faithful to traditional cel-animation aesthetics. Miyakazi's <i>Spirited Away</i> may have the scale and sweep to josh with Pixar's <i>Finding Nemo</i>, but clock the Francophone 'toons: Senegalese fair tale <i>Kirikou and the Sorceress</i>, the Tintin-esque <i>Bcassine and the Viking Treasure</i>, and this first feature from the director of the baroque Parisian short <i>The Old Lady and the Pigeons</i>. Admittedly, its perspective is more dog's eye than child's, but that's in keeping with Chomet's skewed stance on all matters human. There's a whiff of wishful re-imagining the world in that title, and certainly at large in the story. Our hero's hometown mushrooms monstrous in the blink of years, and it befalls some shady kidnappers to whisk him across the Atlantic to the alternate metropolis of Belleville, a lavish Qubecois twist on Manhattan. In between, our orphaned Champion grows up under the spartan watch of the clubfooted Madame Souza, who rears him as the racing cyclist equivalent of a prize ox, all piston thighs and baleful eyes. Meekly strapped to the wheel(s), he's subsequently rigged up like a human dynamo to a miniature toy model of himself, with a projected racing film for blinkers. How's that for an animator's caustic self-portrait? For sanity's sake, probably best to analyse no further, but rather relish the film's deadpan grotesquery, its flair for invention, be it the fanciful narrative segues or various object lessons in customising a vacuum cleaner, and the almost blas beauty Chomet slips in alongside the caricature. Pretty fruity, really.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The twin shadows of the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings franchises hang unmistakeably over Disneys $150 million-dollar Christmas offering. Spot the telltale signs: a central cast of well-spoken British schoolkids with a penchant for fighting dark forces; a strange and distant land (ie New Zealand); the seamless interaction of man and creature; the triumph of good over evil via an epic battle; the promise of endless sequels and cereal box tie-ins<br />Fans of CS Lewiss book can rest easy. Disney  in cahoots with Republican US oil tycoon Philip Anschutzs production company, Walden Media  has preserved the substance and flavour of the first instalment of Lewiss seven-book Narnia cycle. As in the novel, the oh-so-prim-and-proper Pevensie siblings  Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy  are evacuated from Blitz-stricken suburban Finchley to the large, rural home of a mysterious academic (Jim Broadbent). One by one, they fall through the back of a wardrobe and discover Narnia, a snowy expanse where the White Witch (a sinister Tilda Swinton) has decreed that it should always be winter and Aslan, a big-hearted lion (voiced by Liam Neeson), calls on the same four children to assume political leadership and steer Narnia back to stability and happiness.<br />Its a very British, very twee fantasy and, for discerning adults, an odd cocktail of the New Testament, ideals of medieval kingship and 1940s family values. (Some modern suburban snobberies persist too: the beavers, as voiced by Ray Winstone and Dawn French, are petit-bourgeois Essex homeowners.) And how big is the Jesus factor? Director Andrew Adamson (Shrek) doesnt ignore the Christian allegory in Lewiss story. There are clear scenes of crucifixion, resurrection and ascension (the last, involving Aslan walking along a beach at sunset, is unfortunately comic; in a more pious scene, Lucy and Susan bow their heads like two Marys beneath the cross). Its also made clear that good humans owe their political inheritance to God: as newly-crowned King of Narnia, Peter (William Moseley) resembles Oliviers Henry V.<br />These subtleties will of course be lost on children, and the film is no more explicitly preachy than the book. Judged kindly, Adamson and his team have created a film that is charming, fun and carefully realised, even if it loses steam and magic when it succumbs to an overlong battle-scene towards the end, and never matches either Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings for visual excitement. Still, the idea of religion colluding with flagrant commercialism  la The Passion of the Christ remains unpalatable. At least we dont have to deal with Aslans bloody, weeping wounds.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Like a scrubbed-up werewolf film for kids, this remake of the 1959 family feature sees dog-hating Deputy DA Dave Douglas (Tim Allen) turning into a shaggy mutt at regular intervals. Scratching his ears, growling and chasing after cats may be a tad inconvenient when it comes to his court appearances, but Daves newfound canine status does give him a unique insight into the evil plans of Dr Kozak (Robert Downey Jr), whos performing experiments on animals in an attempt to find the secret of eternal life. So goes the protracted plot of this comedy (the reasons for Daves transformation are equally pointless and best left undescribed here). Allens broad physical comedy is very occasionally amusing  lets face it, kids will laugh at anyone acting like a dog  but while Downeys greedy scientist has potential, the films targeting of a young audience prevents any indulgence of the darker possibilities of its conspiracy plot. The result is mediocre and unnecessarily complicated.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Life for those in fawning, panicked thrall to Runway magazine ber-editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) can be nasty, brutish and short  as wannabe journalist and couture ignoramus Andy (Anne Perky! Hathaway) discovers upon fluking her way into the coveted post of Mirandas second assistant. But can she put up with the jobs incessant, ridiculous demands without going native? <br />The Devil Wears Prada is based on Lauren Weisbergers roman--clef about her spell at Vogue, a blinkered but scathing rejection of fashmagland transformed by Aline Brosh McKennas script into an aspirational Manhattanite fairy-tale about an ugly duckling who goes to the ball but learns theres no place like home. Its far from perfect  a romantic subplot featuring a smoothie writer and the contrived third-act jeopardy at Paris Fashion Week are both duff  but its often very funny, especially Streeps Priestly. She combines stringent expectations with infuriating vagueness and disappointment at the perennial incompetence of those around her. Still, the whole thing is humbug, a giant ad for the industry it affects to critique; any notion that it would be otherwise went out the window when the director of Sex and the City was given the gig. The dodgy cable-knit polymixes and reckless carb consumption that initially mark Andy out are madeover: street crossings become her catwalks and reaching a size four marks a triumph. Sure, she jacks it in to work for a community newspaper, but when you can wheel on Valentino to croon over the creation with which hes just fabulised Streep-Priestly, few 12-year-old girls will be leaving the cinema sighing, Yes! Let me at that rent-fixing scandal!]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Stateside rural fifth-formers Jess Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) and Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb) look a little too old to be playing make-believe, but lets overlook that Leslies fertile imagination gets the better of new-found friend Jess when she introduces him to a fantasy world on the other side of a stream. A secret place filled with weird, imaginary creatures, Terabithia proves an ideal retreat for the kids and a perfect environment in which to drum up the courage to face down school bully, Janice. But tragedy strikes<br />Gabor Csupos directorial debut  based on a 70s book by Katherine Paterson  is an affecting inquest into the nature of courage, mortality, grief and the healing power of faith. Its also a fresh take on the fantasy genre. Where film franchises like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter are set in an alternative reality, here the realm of fantasy is purely a state of mind that helps the children make decisions back in the real world. The CGI effects are competent enough and it all unfolds at an agreeable pace, but its the kids universally distinctive performances that impress most.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>With the likes of Open Hearts and Brothers, Danish director Bier achieved the very special trick of presenting melodramatic situations with such piercing directness we forgot their contrivances. Not difficult to see how this might appeal to Hollywood, yet her studio dbut suffers from the pitfall her best work has thus far avoided, a soggy self-awareness rendering the conflicts on screen into the stuff of sensitive prestige drama.</p><p>Actually, if you were trying to write a film aiming at surefire acting nominations, it would probably look something like this. Halle Berry gets to do grief-stricken stoicism as a mother of two whos just lost saintly property developer husband David Duchovny. Benicio Del Toro has a crack at a recovering junkie, as the late husbands best pal shocked into changing his ways. </p><p>Both of them have sundry bonding-with-children highlights, when Berry invites said dopefiend to live in their garage .Funnily enough, the way the children (Alexis Llewellyn and Micah Berry) adapt to the changing situation is the most persuasive thing in the movie, which is dogged by a spirit-sappingly predictable storyline, and a lot of over-familiar guff about letting go and moving on. </p><p>Throughout Berry strains too hard for effect, while Del Toros wide-eyed, sticky-up-hair routine is also wearing thin. It all looks suspiciously like a film with one eye on the awards season, and though not exactly negligible, has just been rewarded with zero Oscar nominations.</p>]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[In Search Of A Midnight Kiss]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[This debut indie flick is a crude, funny and tender riff on romance with a script that crackles with deadpan, spiky humour. Its New Years Eve in Alex Holdridges monochrome, nouvelle vague version of Los Angeles. The day starts badly for aspiring, late- twentysomething screenwriter Wilson (Scoot McNairy) when his best friend and housemate Jacob (Brian McGuire) catches him masturbating to a Photoshop mock-up of his girlfriend, Min (Kathleen Luong). Neither laidback Jacob nor his girlfriend mind very much, and neither do we: were too busy sympathising with likeable, wry Wilson to find this episode anywhere near as vulgar as it sounds.<br /><br />Were with Wilson from the off: this young man, all week-long stubble and indie threads, looks like hes got the world on his shoulders. Hes hurting over the girlfriend hes left behind in Texas and worried about spending New Years on his own. Its that fear of loneliness that drives him to put an ad on Craigs List calling himself a misanthrope whos seeking the same. <br />Within hours hes at a local French caf being interrogated by self-styled steely vixen Vivian (Sara Simmonds) who underneath her dark sunglasses and callous put-downs (Im not going to waste my New Years Eve on some total fuck-up) is as vulnerable as Wilson. While she and Wilson walk and talk about downtown LA, each of them fronting and flirting and joking in their self-protecting way, we hear the endless voicemails from her boyfriend whos crying about her unexplained disappearance.<br /><br />The heart of the film unfolds on the streets as Wilson and Vivian wander about the city. This is the central LA of abandoned theatres, tired pavements and office plazas  miles from Hollywood  and Holdridge does a great job of turning it into a theatre and sucking up all that it has to offer. He reminds us how lonely the city can be. As we look at Wilson and Vivian standing in an empty theatre, marvelling at the ceiling and enjoying each others company, we thank God for Craigs List, even if hes trying to discuss art and she insists on talking about the cool rooftop pool at the Standard Hotel.<br />Theres some Texan folk on the soundtrack that Holdridge uses to anchor this chatty, often laddish film, in a quieter emotional reality. Youve got to hand it to him for daring his men to speak their minds without coming across as unlikeable stereotypes. Its amusing and spot-on when Jacob reduces humans to the level of beasts, telling Wilson not to be afraid to carry a condom on a date because were animals, were apes, we stick bits of plastic into us so we can come.<br />Much of the movie plays out like this: someone says something filthy and personal and were hooting with laughter and nursing a little heartbreak from the truth of it. A few other films come to mind   Bout de Souffle, Before Sunrise, Knocked Up, even Manhattan  but finally Midnight Kiss achieves a laidback, Los Angeles hipster charm all of its own.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Every middle-aged Saturday Night Live alumnus grazing the wider pastures of Hollywood comes to a big decision: do you follow the model of Steve Martin and traipse into middlebrow mania? Or, like Bill Murray (and, to a lesser degree, the Mike Myers of The Love Guru), do you pursue your muse even further into go-it-alone weirdness? Adam Sandler may have made his choice. After flirting with some fascinating sourness in Judd Apatows Funny People, hes ready to sweeten up a bit; Grown Ups, a benignly crude slice of family hysteria, reunites him with ex-SNL-ers Chris Rock, David Spade and Rob Schneider (plus obligatory chubster Kevin James), as former 12-year-old basketball teammates drawn together decades later when their coach kicks the bucket.<br />Back to their old summer lodge they go, along with several impossibly attractive wives  the breast-feeding Maria Bello; a quietly dominating Maya Rudolph; high-strung fashion fiend Salma Hayek Pinault (who?)  plus a swarm of carefully written kids destined to wise up in the great outdoors. No viewer goes into this movie expecting John Cassavetess Husbands, least of all from soft-serve director Denis Dugan (You Dont Mess with the Zohan). But would it have been such a crushing blow to these stars egos if theyd accommodated a little honest anxiety, instead of the typical lake-rope-swinging mishaps and an inevitable Steve Buscemi cameo? Telegraphed down to the final shot of a basketball contest, Grown Ups suggests a mask being torn off to reveal another one: the male fantasy of cheerleader spouse, well-adjusted kids and expanding waistline.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[From The Servant to The Rocky Horror Picture Show to The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, powerplay between homeowners and the help has long been a film staple. Through understated, naturalistic technique, engaging, nuanced performances and assured storytelling that balances the suspenseful and the affecting, The Maid offers a pleasingly sly, ultimately endearing take on the set-up. Raquel (Catalina Saavedra) has been with a comfortable Santiago family for more than 20 years. She is part of the clan in some ways  as longstanding emotional attachments, both positive and negative, attest  but in others remains apart, even expendable. <br />So when its suggested that an extra pair of hands around the house might be useful, Raquels self-preservation instincts kick in. Deadpan, handheld technique allows director Sebastin Silva to mine mundane situations for subtle hazard but also to take his story in unexpected directions, initial reticence preserving the potential for surprise. Theres a similar quality to Saavedras performance, whose Raquel is now downtrodden, wily and vulnerable. The result offers a fruitful ambivalence far richer than any butler-did-it clich.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The dullness of British mainstream cinema is epitomised by this Stephen Frears  didnt he used to be an auteur?  adaptation of Posy Simmondss gently teasing 2005-2007 Guardian comic strip about rural goings-on. In the sense that you have soft porn, this is soft Brecht, a gentle, mildly amusing deconstruction of rural melodrama offering a self-amused wink at Hardy and Austen but being smiled back at by Mills and Boon.<br />Gemma Artertons tightly clad titular music journo returns to the country to inherit her family pile and set three lots of hearts and groins aflame: lecherous fiftysomething writer Nick (Roger Allam), teen-throb indie muso Ben (Dominic Cooper) and her childhood sweetheart, bare-torsoed handyman Andy (Luke Evans).<br />Much of the action takes place at Ewedown, the farm-turned-writers retreat run by Nick and his put-upon wife Beth (Tamsin Greig). Serial philanderer Nick flits to and fro, returning to host crime masterclasses to fawning admirers. All this is observed by Frears in the manner of an indulgent uncle, allowing his actors a soupon of caricature, with detours around the charming environs to satisfy foreign audiences and homegrown admirers of Midsomer Murders or Location, Location, Location. <br />The only characters who generate any interest are the terminally bored, all-seeing, sex and fanzine-obsessed teenagers (nicely played by Jessica Barden and Charlotte Christie) who comment, sneer, scheme and plot from a disused nearby bus shelter, and Boss, Bens unruly boxer pup, who collared the tenth anniversary Palm Dog at last years Cannes.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[On the evidence of its chic promotional poster and a trailer intercut with wistful platitudes (He a writer in search of meaning. She an art dealer in search of originality), youd swear that Certified Copy was the result of a ludicrous clerical error saddling Iranian maestro Abbas Kiarostami with the script for a droll coffee-table rom-com while, elsewhere in Europe, a baseball-capped minnow struggled to fashion an abstract visual essay on the nature of the subjective conscious. Of course, thats not entirely the case. But while its true that Kiarostami appears to have drawn a line under a decade of provocative visual experimentation  resulting in such poetic cinematic workouts as Five, Ten and Shirin  not long into his latest it becomes clear that this is just as challenging, ambiguous and moving as anything hes made before.<br /><br />Like those earlier titles, the act of consuming Certified Copy requires a willingness to engage in a game of intellectual hide-and-seek. In the past, Kiarostami challenged us to think about off-camera space  what is happening outside the frame that could influence whats on the screen. Here, he offers a decontextualised fragment of a relationship which only begins to make sense if we consider the details outside the storys timeframe. Juliette Binoche stars as a ruffled, slightly manic antique dealer, opposite English opera baritone William Shimell as an arrogant cultural commentator on a brief Italian stopover to deliver a lecture on the value of copies in art. Over the course of a single afternoon, they meet, drive into the Tuscan countryside, go for lunch, wander around a gallery and discuss the nuances of art, love, family and possible discrepancies in Shimells thesis. When a waitress naturally assumes the pair to be romantically entangled, Kiarostami takes that cue to have his characters mutate into what appears to be a bickering wedded couple. The game is set: is this love or just a copy?<br />Theres a pleasingly self-aware quality to the dialogue in the film, as if Kiarostami is anticipating the inevitable auteurist deconstructions of its meticulous structure and composition. In a telling line, Shimell admits, I only wrote the book to convince myself of my own ideas, as if this rambling tale is organically working itself out as it goes along. Binoche and Shimell are superb: she expressive, impulsive and emotional; he haughty, dogmatic yet vulnerable. If theres a problem with the film, its the idea that two people would instinctively choose to immerse themselves in unbroken role play. <br />It makes the ambiguities ring a little false and dampens the easy naturalism to which the film obviously aspires. But if Kiarostamis fingerprints are occasionally evident on the screen, the pairs off-kilter chemistry and the unquestionable artistry of the filmmaking prevents this from descending into an exercise in cold, technical pyrotechnics. And in true Kiarostami style, the final shot is an absolute doozy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A decent cast wrestle with a crummy script in this loose and creaky Hollywood spin on Le Dner de Cons, Francis Vebers award-winning French play and film. Middle-ranking corporate investment exec Tim (Paul Rudd) is angling for a promotion, but to seal the deal he has to run along with his blokey bosss invitation to a meal at his mansion to which every guest has to bring an out-and-out idiot. Lucky for Tim, he almost runs over Barry (Steve Carrell), a humourless, thick-skinned tax-office nobody and fan of small stuffed animals. The meal itself, which comes late in the day, feels like an afterthought, with more attention paid to low-grade farcical larks involving Tims fiance Julie (Stephanie Szostak), her self-possessed artist boss (Jemaine Clement), Tims ditzy blonde stalker (Lucy Punch), a potential Swiss investor (David Walliams) and Barrys cruel boss (Zach Galifianakis).

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Alexandre Aja says his 3D re-working of Joe Dantes 1978 original is an attempt to recreate the guilty pleasure movies of his youth. So here, in the best/worst traditions of '70s exploitation cinema, are flesh-eating fishy gore, lip-smacking nudity and lots of laugh-out-loud silliness. If youre looking for the anti-establishment message found in the John Sayles scripted, Roger Corman-produced Jaws rip-off, you will be disappointed. However, the re-makes cheesy, eye-popping 3D effects  flayed bodies, naked breasts, vomit and a severed penis are all flung out of the screen - are an authentic, affectionate throwback to cheapo Cormanesque excess.<br />When an underground earthquake releases shoals of prehistoric piranha into Lake Victoria, local sheriff Julie Forester (Elizabeth Shue) tries in vain to persuade several thousand Spring Break revellers to quit their aquatic hedonism before they become fish food. Meanwhile, her son Jake (Steven R McQueen) has been lured onto a pleasure boat by slimeball porn director Derrick (Jerry OConnell) and busty, bikini-clad star Danni (British glamour model Kelly Brook). Also aboard is nice girl Kelly (Jessica Szohr), on whom Jake has a crush, who ends up licking tequila, salt and lime off the body and lips of Dannis co-star Crystal (real-life porn star Riley Steele). But once the fishy feeding frenzy starts, its human flesh thats on the menu. </p><p>Aja serves up the tongue-in-cheek thrills, CGI-enhanced gore and gratuitous nudity with such unabashed relish that this may prove to be the summers break-out horror hit. There are also nice cameos from Richard Dreyfuss, reprising his Jaws role, and Hostel director Eli Roth, who completely loses his head after hosting a wet T-shirt contest. A guilty pleasure? Guilty as charged.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The best of Fellini went into this bleakly funny study of five young men adrift in the wasteland of their provincial home town. Middle class layabouts living by cadging off their families, aimlessly spending their days in pursuit of amusement and girls while nursing vague ambitions never likely to be more than pipe-dreams, they are trapped as much by their own moral bankruptcy as by the futureless society in which they have never quite grown up. Beautifully shot and performed, and governed by an inextricable mixture of affectionate sympathy and acid satire, it clearly (and beneficially) trails the neo-realist roots which Fellini later shook off.]]></review>

The crew embark on a chase through contemporary California: Spock gets to put the Vulcan pinch on a punk, Kirk gets lost on a downtown bus, and Chekov hits the street to find a nuclear 'wessel' (in order to get enough juice for the ship, whales and water to make the jump through time). Nimoy's irreverent tone makes it more digestible than it sounds: a myth whose heart lies 20 years in the past, and whose eyes look 2,000 years into the future.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The casting of Steve McQueen as the hero of Ibsen's play (a scientist determined to expose the pollution of a prosperous small town's water supply) threatens the worst. But his performance, together with Durning's as his brother the mayor (equally determined to put the lid on any scandal) make it fairly creditable. Sure, it's stagebound. But decent production values, and direction that preserves the suspense of Ibsen's exposition, make sure that it remains watchable until the play's own unsatisfactory last act. The only really offensive aspects are the denunciation scene, and the degeneration of the hero into an increasingly sentimentalised Christ-like martyrdom, as much the fault of the text as of McQueen's interpretation.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[No pigs or wells in sight in Hong's justly acclaimed first feature, which looks at the lives of five very recognisable urban types as if all of them were witnesses at the scene of some freak accident. These men and women make mistakes and suffer frustrations in the ways we all do: a failed novelist blames everyone but himself for his inability to keep a relationship going; a woman dreams of divorcing her husband and pins her hopes on a lover who has already moved on; a generally faithful husband impulsively rents a hooker while on a business trip and catches an STD. Part of the pleasure here comes from the skill with which Hong interweaves these seemingly unconnected lives; the rest comes from the excellence of the images, sounds and performances and from Hong's warm but unsentimental engagement with his characters.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Certainly Dmytryk's best British film, made after his blacklist exile and before freedom from the Hollywood system led him into the pretensions of <i>Give Us This Day</i>. Adapted by Alec Coppel from his own novel, it's an intriguing 'perfect murder' thriller in which an obsessively jealous husband lures his rival to a cellar on a bomb site, keeping him chained there until the coast is clear and his own grimly meticulous preparations for disposing of the body in an acid bath are complete. Perhaps only Buuel could have done justice to the flavour as the avenger sadistically torments his victim during the wait, and an odd intimacy starts to spring up between them. Here both dialogue and performances (with Newton doing much less eye-rolling than usual) stay a little too close to the surface, but it has much the same narrative grip as Dmytryk's earlier Hollywood movies like <i>Murder My Sweet</i>, <i>Cornered</i> and <i>Crossfire</i>.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An urban crime thriller which won undeserved acclaim for its efficient but unremarkable elevated-railway chase and its clumsy, showy emphasis on grainy, sordid realism. The performances are strong, although Hackman has done far better than this portrayal of a hard-nosed cop obsessively tracking down a narcotics ring in New York, using methods disapproved of by his superiors. The real problems, however, are that Friedkin's nervy, noisy, undisciplined pseudo-realism sits uneasily with his suspense-motivated shock editing; and that compared to (say) Siegel's <i>Dirty Harry</i>, the film maintains no critical distance from (indeed, rather relishes) its 'loveable' hero's brutal vigilante psychology.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[What better theatre in which to explore desire, hysteria, temptation and sexuality than a remote convent high up in the Indian Himalayas? And theatre this Michael Powell film most certainly is, as stressed by the gothic melodrama of the story and the acting, the studio setting with its beautiful backdrops and vivid colours and the most deliberate of characters and events. Theres something in the atmosphere which makes everything seem exaggerated, says Mr Dean (David Farrar), the nuns charming local nemesis. Indeed there is, Mr Dean, and what superbly crafted, elemental and entertaining theatre this Powell and Pressburger film remains almost 60 years on.Sister Clodagh (Deborah Kerr) is taken by surprise when asked to select four nuns from her convent in Calcutta with whom to travel to distant Mopu at the back of beyond and found a small, rural nunnery. Its Sister Clodaghs experience that forms the intellectual heart of this film, which appears deceptively light at first. Flashbacks reveal the reason behind her decision to become a nun: she fled a well-heeled, rural life in Ireland when a longed-for marriage failed to materialise. Which makes her relationship with bare-legged, rugged Dean  a local charmer and know-it-all  all the more stimulating. Dont you like children? asks Dean provocatively. Another nun, Sister Ruth (Kathleen Byron), who we know is sick, is a violent cauldron of conflicting desires and acts as a mirror to Sister Clodaghs repression. Their relationship contributes to the films most terrifying, artful scenes at its dramatic close.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Kinugasa's second film with his experimental theatre company, made two years after the better-known <i>Page of Madness</i>. At root, it's a simple melodrama about a young man's infatuation with a geisha, and his sister's frantic attempts to save him from himself. As such, it may seem too slow and over-emphatic for some tastes. But its imagery, lighting and montage effects are at least as daring as those in the earlier film, and fully the equal of anything done in the West at the time. Kinugasa's fidelity to physical realities (like breath misting in the freezing air and steam rising from sodden clothing) is often chilling, but his vision of the Yoshiwara pleasure district as a 'hell' of lights, shadows and frenetic movement also brings out his remarkable gifts as an expressionist. Certainly much more than an archive curiosity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[What more can one say about this much-loved, much discussed blockbuster? It epitomises Hollywood at its most ambitious (not so much in terms of art, but of middlebrow, respectable entertainment served up on a polished platter); it's inevitably racist, alarmingly sexist (Scarlett's submissive smile after marital rape), nostalgically reactionary (wistful for a vanished, supposedly more elegant and honourable past), and often supremely entertaining. It never really confronts the political or historical context of the Civil War, relegating it to a backdrop for the emotional upheavals of Leigh's conversion from bitchy Southern belle to loving wife. It's also the perfect example of Hollywood as an essentially collaborative artistic production centre. Cukor, Sam Wood and Fleming directed from a script by numerous writers (including Scott Fitzgerald and Ben Hecht); William Cameron Menzies provided the art designs; there's a top-notch cast; and producer David O Selznick oversaw the whole project obsessively from start to finish. Yet, although anonymous, it's still remarkably coherent.]]></review>

The movie was made by MGM British in the manner of <i>Mrs Miniver</i>, and was to have been directed by Wesley Ruggles. Divided into three 'acts', with a script by Clemence Dane, it is a reasonably acted, authentically staged evocation of British resolve under stress.

      <review><![CDATA[Less assertively 'new' than <i>The Day a Pig Fell into the Well</i> but more complex in structure and subtler in effect, Hong's second film tells two seemingly distinct stories (one after the other) and leaves the viewer to grapple with two disconcerting revelations: first, that the two protagonists are ex-lovers who have never got over each other, and second, that their stories happen <i>not</i> sequentially but within the <i>same</i> time frame. The first centres on Jisook, a young woman from Seoul who takes a trip to Kangwon with two girlfriends and meets a nice-but-married cop with whom she stays in touch. The second centres on Cho, a between-jobs teacher with a wife and kid; he, too, takes a short break in Kangwon with an old schoolfriend, who already has tenure in a university teaching post. The twist of lemon is that the two stories are also virtual mirror images of each other, as if both were variations on some larger meta-narrative. Virtuoso film-making, but not in the least high flown; Hong's targets are the ways people trap themselves in routines of all kinds, and the ways people hide truths from themselves and each other behind desultory small talk.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An epic medieval meditation, filmed at some length from a purportedly unfilmable novel by Vladislav Vancura. Acting out the intrigue, suspicion and bloodlust of 13th century tribal rivalry, the plot, such as it is, is wilfully wayward and often close to impenetrable. As 'pure cinema', though, it's stark, daring and often astoundingly dynamic. Black and white 'Scope camerawork surveys a cruel, desolate landscape of plains, castles and forests populated by scavenging strays, strugglers, tyrants and wolf-men, while an eerily evocative sound design gives the picture a near hallucinatory quality. It's not so much a drama as an ancient litany - mystical and feral rather than spiritual or religious.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Wong's paean to the agony'n ecstasy of buttoned-up emotions is a kind-of sequel to <i>Days of Being Wild</i>, shaped and scored as a <i>valse triste</i>. In Hong Kong, 1962, Mr Chow (Leung) and Mrs Chan (Cheung) are neighbours who discover that their spouses are having an affair. He finds excuses to spend time with her, apparently intending to jilt her. Then they fall in love, but (aside from one reckless moment in a hotel) repress their feelings. He runs away to work as a journalist in Singapore; in 1966, covering De Gaulle's state visit to Cambodia, he's in Angkor Wat trying to unburden himself of the secret which overwhelms his life... Every charged frame of the film pulses with the central contradiction between repression and emotional abandon; the formalism and sensuality are inextricable. Career-best performances from both leads, Leung having a Cannes 'Best Actor' prize to show for his.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A briskly entertaining (if ideologically cosy) espionage thriller set during World War II, with Kerr as an Irish colleen brought up on her father's tales of his exploits against the wicked English. Setting out to join the IRA but sidetracked into innocently spying for the Nazis in Dublin, she is run ragged all over the place - including the Isle of Man - before suffering a change of heart when she falls for a British officer (Howard). Rather too whimsical, but littered with engagingly Hitchcockian conceits like the disposal of a corpse by taking it for a stroll in a wheelchair.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hollywood's chutzpah whizzkids Spielberg and Lucas team up to bring the audiences who flocked to <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Close Encounters</i> a replay of the innocent pleasures of Saturday serials, but done at two hours length with a much larger budget than the old cliffhangers could command. Spielberg's evasion of present day realities in an effort to recapture the sheer childlike fun of moviegoing is as perverse as was his previous film, <i>1941</i>. What he offers is one long, breathtaking chase of a plot as his pre-World War II superhero, outsize and Bogartian, races to prevent the omnipotent Ark of the Covenant from falling into the hands of Hitler's Nazis. Whether you swallow it or not, see it for a handful of totally unexpected visual jokes, worth the price of admission alone.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Polanski's first feature, a model of economic, imaginative film-making which, in many ways, he has hardly improved upon since. The story is simplicity itself: a couple destined for a yachting weekend pick up a hitch-hiker, and during the apparently relaxing period of sport and rest, allegiances shift, frustrations bubble up to the surface, and dangerous emotional games are played. Like much of Polanski's later work, it deals with humiliation, sexuality, aggression and absurdity; but what makes the film so satisfying is the tenderness and straightforward nature of his approach. With just three actors, a boat, and a huge expanse of water, he and script-writer Jerzy Skolimowski milk the situation for all it's worth, rarely descending into dramatic contrivance, but managing to heap up the tension and ambiguities.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Four hijackers, got up like Groucho Marx and led by Robert Shaw with the voice of a Dalek, kidnap a New York subway train and hold the city to ransom. Saviour of the system is Transit Authority Inspector Matthau, harking back to his early acting days as a grim heavy, and with a Bronx accent as thick and fancy as a piece of angel cake. It's a slice of Urban Crisis life, you see, and to prove it the occupants of the train 'represent a cross-section of New York: a pimp, a Puerto Rican pregnant girl, a hippie, a hooker, a WASP, a wino and a homosexual'. This movie's so up-to-date even the mayor's a laughing-stock. Yet, despite the caricature, the facile screenplay by Peter Stone, and the desperate direction from Sargent ('who has directed some of television's finest hours'), the film retains a fascination - the way <i>Juggernaut</i> did; and needless to say, it's been a monster hit in cities with an underground system.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A severely beautiful Western based on the life of a semi-legendary cowboy who served as a cavalry scout, was then hired to wage secret war on Wyoming rustlers, and was eventually hanged by a society which had outgrown his maverick values. McQueen's performance is all the more affecting (his penultimate film) now that we know he was suffering from an incurable cancer. But the film's glaring production problems - rewrites to Thomas McGuane's script, change of director (it was started by James William Guercio), extensive re-editing - ruin what might otherwise have been an extraordinarily eloquent political fable.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hong's latest wry dissection of the gap between head and heart is divided into seven chapters, but the plot falls neatly into two halves. In the first, out-of-work actor Kyung-Soo (Kim Sang-Kyung) visits a country town famous for its lakes and has a fling with a dance instructor (Yea); she's crazy for him, but her affection turns him off and he bolts. In the second, he takes a train and chats to Sun-Young (Chu), who recognises him from his stage work; he gets off at Kyungju to follow her home and next day knocks on her door. They have sex in a hotel and he begs her to abandon husband and family to run away with him. She declines - and reminds him that anyway they met in similar circumstances twenty years earlier... As in <i>The Power of Kangwon Province</i>, the two halves are riddled with parallels, echoes and contrasts; the plotting is as intricate and detailed as anything you'd find in 19th century fiction (a form explicitly evoked by the descriptive chapter-titles), but the overall aesthetic strategy is as modernist as an ace scratch-mix. Often ruefully funny, too.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[At a time when 'Blimpishness' in the high command was under suspicion as detrimental to the war effort, Powell and Pressburger gave us their own Blimp based on David Low's cartoon character - Major General Clive Wynne-Candy, VC - and back-track over his life, drawing us into sympathy with the prime virtues of honour and chivalry which have transformed him from dashing young spark of the Nineties into crusty old buffer of World War II. Roger Livesey gives us not just a great performance, but a man's whole life: losing his only love (Deborah Kerr) to the German officer (Walbrook) with whom he fought a duel in pre-WWI Berlin, then becoming the latter's lifelong friend and protector. Like much of Powell and Pressburger's work, it is a salute to all that is paradoxical about the English; no one else has so well captured their romanticism banked down beneath emotional reticence and honour. And it is marked by an enormous generosity of spirit: in the history of the British cinema there is nothing to touch it. CPea.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Despite the relevance of its theme, Walter Greenwood's sentimental tragedy remains very much a '30s period piece. The Salford slums look as irredeemably picturesque as the surrounding Pennine countryside, and 'Honest' Sam Grundy in his big car and check suit looks more like a teddy bear than a repulsive villain. Kerr is hardly the archetypical Lancashire mill-girl, but her mixture of coolness and fragility works surprisingly well in the scenes with the grumbling, bullying father she 'disgraces' and the fawningly lecherous bookie she pawns her body to. The real bite, though, comes from the gaggle of black-coated gossips - Mrs Dorbell, Mrs Nattle, Mrs Jike and Mrs Bull - who, Greek-chorus-like, pronounce judgment over their hap'orth of gin.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The eponymous character in this faithful, live-action adaptation of EB Whites quaint 1952 tale of friendship, salvation, sacrifice and mortality isnt, as the title suggests, some noirish femme fatale. Rather, shes an innocent spider with a propensity for literacy. But then most schoolkids already knew that.
<br />The film begins with the sight of a runty piglet called Wilbur being carted off to slaughter. Alarmed by the prospect of a cute piggy ending up in the smokehouse, the farmers daughter, Fern (Dakota Fanning), convinces her father to reprieve it, at least temporarily. Sadly, when Wilbur becomes too big to handle, hes dispatched to a neighbouring farm to await the breakfast table. But then something miraculous occurs In the doorway to Wilburs new pen, a spiders web appears with the words some pig emblazoned across it. Its a Field of Dreams moment, a spiritual occurrence that attracts hundreds of folk from far and wide. Seems the little fella could be saved after all
Whites endearing book has long been considered one of the most sensible childrens books on the subject of mortality and the cycle of life, and Gary Winicks anthropomorphic Babe-like effort handles those aspects with care and sensitivity. But in the main its a dull slog punctuated by unfunny fart jokes and tired knockabout humour. Of the all-star voice cast  Julia Roberts, Steve Buscemi, Robert Redford  only John Cleese is recognisable and rather annoyingly at that. Still, youngsters will warm to the barns talking animals and perhaps even shed a tear at the sight of a spider shuffling off the mortal coil. Arachnaphobes, though, are advised to approach with caution.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[We must wash the French flag clean with our blood! exhorts an Algerian village leader, idealistically and self-sacrificially, at the opening of writer-director-producer Boucharebs grand World War II movie, an impressive, expensively mounted international co-production which tries  on the whole, successfully  to juggle the competing imperatives of the epic war movie with its concern to highlight the often-unacknowledged part that indigenous (that is Arab and North African) troops played in the liberation of France from the Axis forces and their sorry treatment subsequently. Its a grand, important thesis, conceived with a scope that compares to Sam Fullers The Big Red One. Its shot in widescreen and, similarly, follows an army contingent comprising a half-dozen highlighted individuals across the European theatre, beginning with the carnage of the North African campaign (in 1943) before moving on to the liberation of the mainland, here a protracted sequence of a platoon flushing out the last remaining German presence in Alsace-Lorraine. <br />The first thing to say is that Bouchareb shows a real talent for action sequences, with cinematographer Patrick Blossier equally at home filming the attacks of the massed ranks against the dust and grey rocks of Africa as he is with the more intimate scale of the house-to-house fighting of the finale. Not surprisingly, given the ambitious amount of freight carried by his and Olivier Lorelles script  which tries to honour not only the bravery and determination of the soldiers, but also to acknowledge and personalise their various ethnic, class and professional divisions and the injusticies and discrimination they were subject to  some of the performances seem a little weighed down by assigned types, not least French comic actor Jamel Debbouzes overly caricatured ordinary Joe. Its also true that Bouchareb does seem too happy to adopt some of the more clichd tropes of the war movie  the worst example of which is a slightly awkward episode of romantic fraternisation with a grateful liberated French woman. But overall, its an effective, thoughtful and stirring film which  aided by a number of memorable performances, not least those of Sami Bouajila as the stalwart Corporal Abdelkader and Bernard Blancan as the unyielding Sergeant Martinez  stands alongside Eastwoods diptych as important, relevant and corrective accounts of the damned contradictions of institutionalised human warfare.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Lets get one thing clear: there is nothing questionable about heterosexual actor John Travolta clad in a fat suit, dragged up in pink sequins and breathily trilling Im the cutest chickie that you ever did see! There is, however, something awkward and faintly disturbing about watching his Edna Turnblad dance and duet with Christopher Walkens Mr Turnblad dressed in toreador kitsch. Divine it aint. In fact, so peculiarly mannered is Ednas transformation from chipmunky homebody to liberated blob that its quite impossible to forget youre watching John Travolta in latex and, therefore, to suspend disbelief. Nor is that made any easier by uncertain, sometimes clashing performances from such other big names as Michelle Pfeiffer, Queen Latifah and indeed Walken, whose dance skills are criminally underused.</p><p>That said, this new Hairspray  adapted from the Broadway musical based on the 1988 film  is often great fun. Though not as scabrous, as sharp or even as musically memorable as John Waters original, it retains much of his filthy, big-hearted sensibility (he cameos as a happy flasher) and is less deadeningly stagey than that other recent film-of-the-musical-of-the-film, The Producers. Stepping into Ricki Lakes pumps as Tracy Turnblad  the tubby teen who takes 1962 Baltimore music TV by storm and nearly sparks a race riot by declaring I wish every day were Negro Day!  Nikki Blonsky is unflaggingly chipper as both naive kid chastised for inappropriate hair height and indignant civil-rights activist. Throw in plenty of sparky numbers and snarky gags and that chubby Communist girl is hard to resist.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A treat for Indian movie buffs and lovers of silent melodrama alike, this lovely BFI digital restoration of Franz Ostens moving and picaresque tale of fighting princes, thwarted love  and the perils of gambling is going on countrywide tour as part of the India Now celebrations. The German-born Osten, along with his Indian producer Himansu Rai, is often cited as a father of modern Bollywood and you feel in his accessible, animal-filled, extras-laden, Rajasthan-set movie quite a modern Mumbai-style musical ebb-and-flow, augmented by now-familiar but then startling location work (of forts, forests and lakes) and very engaging, if still recognisably silent-era, performances, especially from Charu Roy as the smiling royal gambler and sweet Seeta Devi as his coy bride. Lets hope its dry on Thursday, when you can catch a free preview in Trafalgar Square, with the LSO and Nitin Sawhneys band performing the eclectic compositeur-du-jours entirely appropriate  new East-meets-West score.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Forget Titanic. Sono Shions four-hour countercultural romantic epic is surely the Gone with the Wind de nos jours. Novelistic in scope and emotional richness, Love Exposure details the long and winding courtship of star-crossed lovers Yu (Takahiro Nishijima) and Yoko (Hikari Mitsushima). These dysfunctional, hypersensitive Japanese teens and their quest for erotic and spiritual enlightenment make for a swooning, often riotously funny melodrama charged with a refreshingly perverse undertow. <br />Yu is the son of a priest but is relentlessly driven towards a life of sin. He learns kung fu with the help of a local street gang. Then he becomes a world champion up-skirt photographer, a pastime he relishes, believing that one day he will snap the panties of his true love. Coming to the rescue of aggressive tearaway Yoko in a street fight, he exhibits a humungous bulge in his slacks that suggests that destiny is calling. But matters are complicated by the fact that, at the time, he happens to be disguised as svelte femme warrior Ms Scorpion, and Yokos subsequent decision that shes a lesbian. <br />On paper, it sounds like lo-fi madcap idiocy, but Sono manages to elevate this potentially seedy and glib yarn to something approaching pop-philosophical genius. He does this by focusing on a very small group of characters and is served by a clutch of utterly committed, unselfconscious performances from actors who genuinely understand and believe in the material. A segment about religious cult deprogramming in the final hour is perhaps a twist too far, but for the most part this is a film that will have you tingling with pleasure from charming start to heart-pounding finish.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Lumet's origins as a director of teledrama may well be obvious here in his first film, but there is no denying the suitability of his style - sweaty close-ups, gritty monochrome 'realism', one-set claustrophobia - to his subject. Scripted by Reginald Rose from his own teleplay, the story is pretty contrived - during a murder trial, one man's doubts about the accused's guilt gradually overcome the rather less-than-democratic prejudices of the other eleven members of the jury - but the treatment is tense, lucid, and admirably economical. Fonda, though typecast as the bastion of liberalism, gives a nicely underplayed performance, while Cobb, Marshall and Begley in particular are highly effective in support. But what really transforms the piece from a rather talky demonstration that a man is innocent until proven guilty, is the consistently taut, sweltering atmosphere, created largely by Boris Kaufman's excellent camerawork. The result, however devoid of action, is a strangely realistic thriller.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Actor Jason Segel is no Adonis. We learn this from an early and already notorious scene in Forgetting Sarah Marshall in which the titular TV star dumps our hero, Peter Bretter, played by Segel (also the films writer), as he stands completely nude in the kitchen of their apartment, weeping and begging her to stay. And yet, despite his distinctly average-guy physique, Peter still manages to seduce (by my count) five exceptionally beautiful women over the course of the film. <br />Because this isnt the real world: this is producer Judd Apatows world, in which the crotch-scratching schlub is king and its only a matter of time before even the most glamorous females fall under his slovenly spell.<br />From its opening montage of slacker Peter mooching through an average day, Sarah Marshall is textbook Apatow, replete with all the embarrassments and cringeworthy mishaps that audiences have come to expect. It sports a cavalcade of scene-stealing cameos from regular alumni like Jonah Hill, Bill Hader and, most memorably, Paul Rudd as archetypal surf-burnout Kunu. The fresh face is our own Russell Brand, typecast as self-absorbed, sex-obsessed but oddly lovable rock legend Aldous Snow, the unwelcome hypotenuse in Peter and Sarahs love triangle. <br />The films major flaw lies in its narrative: Segels script was rewritten over an exhaustive 18 months, and it shows. Lacking a recognisable hook  like those in Knocked Up or 40 Year Old Virgin, the story tends to flounder. But Sarah Marshall remains a film of glorious moments and memorable scenes, lovingly crafted characters and sparkling one-liners. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This subjective double take transcends the limitations of the biopic to exult in the artistry of the great cellist Jacqueline du Pr, even as it poses profound troubling questions about communication, destiny and the artist's sense of her own identity. Taking its cue from the controversial memoir<i> A Genius in the Family</i>, by Jackie's siblings Hilary and Piers, the movie begins with the prodigy finding free expression in the cello, and rapidly overtaking her elder sister's musical development. This opening movement is played out in a florid, ostentatiously romantic style which is slowly undercut as the sisters - now played by Watson and Griffiths - go their separate ways. Jackie disappears into music's jet setting high society, while Hilary's self-confidence gets a boost from the courtship of the ebullient Kiffer Finzi (Morrisey). When they come together again, the trauma is a defining moment in their lives and the movie's emotional centrepiece. The film's most audacious inspiration is to track back from this shocking, very moving and apparently unforgivable act, to retrace events from Jackie's perspective, revealing her loneliness and her ambivalence towards her instrument and her calling. Watson's performance is virtuoso: passionate, sensitive, impressionable and sometimes grotesque; and she's well matched by the subtle Griffiths and vibrant Morrisey.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The Francis Bacon paintings that haunt the opening credits  are the first hint that life might be both tortuous and beautiful in Bertoluccis unforgettable portrait of grief and anonymous sex in 1970s Paris. The city looks to have been built uniquely for the occasion as Brando  then 48, with shoulder-length greying hair and still so striking  gives his best performance in years as Paul, an American mourning his wifes suicide. He finds solace in the bed of Jeanne (Maria Schneider), a pliant young thing whom he follows into an empty apartment that becomes the stage for their odd and oddly erotic affair (butter, animal noises and No names!). Vittorio Storaros photography  all yellows and browns  takes its cue from Brandos camel coat, and the films volatile emotional register springs from that staggering opening shot of Brando howling under a railway bridge as Schneider ambles past, carefree and beautiful. Its Brandos film: his monologues devastate.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The arrested adolescents from <i>Swingers</i> tangle with the Mob in this belated follow-up to the 1996 indie hit written by Jon Favreau. This time he and Vaughn play hapless Angeleno ex-boxers, Bobby and Ricky, who get a chance to atone for their misdemeanours as delivery boys for old-style crime figure Max (Falk). All they have to do is fly to New York on expenses, hook up with major player Ruiz (Combs), and do the deal. Sounds simple, but fast-talking Ricky has a gift for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, every time. No wonder Bobby's a worried man. Favreau's first directorial effort risks feeling repetitive until you realise it's playing a set of variations on a theme as bigmouth Ricky puts his foot in it and his ever-loyal buddy tries to smoothe things over. Though the scenario echoes <i>Mean Streets</i>, it's actually a comedy of manners in crime-flick garb. If the film's too ready to go with the flow of Chris Doyle's handheld camerawork, and sometimes seems ad hoc, its spot-on attention to the faux pas of the moment certainly raises a smile. If it's never quite a knockout, Vaughn's cannily judged display of virtuoso assholery is something to see.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Pixar's computer-animated rumpus comes to you from Monstropolis, a pastel-coloured parallel world populated by largely peaceable beasts. Sure, some do victimise small children, but purely in a professional capacity: they're the scarers employed by Monsters Inc, the city's scream-fuelled power-generating corporation, to prospect kids' bedrooms and harvest their most piercing shrieks. Take James P Sullivan (voice: Goodman), a horned, shaggy-haired colossus, and the company's star scarer: off-duty you couldn't find a more genial creature, except perhaps for his assistant Mike Wazowski (Crystal), a green walking eyeball who's a hit with all the chicks. Life's smooth scaring, until the unthinkable happens: a small girl called Boo crosses the threshold into Monstropolis. It's common knowledge those things are toxic. A raucous underworld escapade, this is as vibrant and colourful as Orphean comedies come. It's unfailingly lively entertainment that doesn't stint on (earned) feeling. Ideas about fear of the unknown, industrial corruption, and the splendours of polymorphity are all taken in stride. The balance tilts towards action and gags, and does them gloriously.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[What begins like a concert movie and ends with the dull whimper of a moralising fairytale for TV kids is, startlingly enough, a long and expensive pop video. The fact that it is a cut-and-paste job, interpolating chunks of Jackson history in with a sequence of rather feeble cartoon dominated 'episodes', lends the whole adventure the distinctly un-cinematic ambience of a fanzine, which is great for the fans. Mum and Dad and baby sibling, however, will be alarmed and bored by the spectacle - the former alarmed by the vast displacement of cash on so witless a project, and bored because it's boring, the latter frustrated because a human version of <i>My Little Pony</i> is not as entertaining as the real thing. Altogether a ghastly experience, which even the rabid 11-year-old in your life might well find patronising and unimaginative.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An all-time low for the Enterprise and her crew, with Spock dead, the ship condemned, and everyone else looking about 104. But hold! Why is Bones behaving so oddly? Could it be that he contains part of Spock's essence? A sluggish start gives way to quite a fun romp, as the crew's valiant efforts to find Spock are impeded by a bunch of malign Klingons (all with a distinct resemblance to Lemmy of Motorhead), and reaching one surprising anti-climax when the lilywhite Kirk actually starts spluttering and swearing! Decent SFX, but a little more action wouldn't have gone amiss.]]></review>

Thereafter the plot, about a quest for the Ultimate Answer, resembles something Douglas Adams would have thrown in the bin, complete with triple-breasted whores decorating the journey to God's front door. 'Nobody ever went <i>through the barrier</i>!' scream the cast. One sub-<i>2001</i> light show later, Kirk is boldly splitting infinitives in heaven itself, unscarred and (naturally) unimpressed by God, who after all isn't any good with girls. Polarities are duly reversed while Uhura does the dance of the seven veils and smooches with Scotty (warped factor 5!), whose dilithium crystals clearly canna take it any more. Beam me up this instant.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This makes little concession to non-initiates. The Borg, a species of cyborg linked in a hive-consciousness and dedicated to the 'absorption' of all other life-forms, build on their reputation as the TV series' best baddies to invade the Federation: only Picard (Stewart) stands between them and conquest of the Earth. But just when we think we're in for 'Independence Day 2', the routed Borg go back in time to win the war before it began, and we're hurled along with the Enterprise into much darker territory. The Borg's infiltration of the starship recalls some of the tension of <i>Alien</i>, while the attempts of the Borg Queen (Krige) to convert the android Data (Spiner) to the pleasures of the New Flesh are positively transgressive. Certainly Spiner convinces you that androids do dream of electric sheep, and electric ladylands; while Stewart, confronting his conscience, draws a sci-fi blockbuster audience into the intimacy of a fringe play.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This recaptures something of the appeal of the original TV series. In fact, it feels like an extended small screen episode, with one strong idea and a simple, linear storyline. When the android Data (Spiner) runs amok during a Federation sponsored observation, Capt Picard (Stewart) and his crew uncover a conspiracy to deprive the pacifist Ba'ku people of their idyllic, technology free existence. The incentive is the planet's unique atmosphere, which gradually reverses the ageing process. With the Federation's blessing, political opportunist Admiral Dougherty (Zerbe) and So'na leader Ru'afo (Abraham) plan to beam the inhabitants off the planet and relocate them elsewhere. Forced to defy the Federation in order to preserve the integrity of its first principle - non-interference in the separate cultural development of indigenous peoples - Picard and his crew help the Ba'ku to fight back against their would-be dispossessors. Despite the usual strained stabs at topical social significance, Frakes maintains a brisk pace, staging the battle scenes with panache and undercutting the absurd techno gibberish with crass but leavening humour.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The time-travelling premise to Disneys Jetsons-style sci-fi animation bears a faint resemblance to Back to the Future, with elements of The Terminator. Its a frenetic enterprise, but it does at least address the spectre of adoption in a sensitive way. To date, dweebish orphan Lewis has been through 124 adoption interviews; his propensity for inventing things that go wrong is the reason for his latest rejection. Lewis life changes dramatically, however, when young Wilbur Robinson rocks up in his spaceship and whisks him off to the future, a high-rise, pastel-coloured floating world, where Lewis meets the space cadets nutty family. Meanwhile, in the wings is a Dick Dastardly-style figure<br />The first 20 minutes of this competently animated kids adventure are entertaining enough. But thereafter, the plot fractures, the pace goes into overdrive and the jokes wear thin. Some loose ends are tied up, but what a convoluted journey. Check out the impressive 3D version.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>From the people who brought you March of the Penguins, informs the trailer for this wildlife doc by husband and wife Adam Ravetch and Sarah Robertson. That may be, but the only connection I can make between the two  apart from their polar locations  is that they both carry the National Geographic moniker. </p><p>Where March stuck to a mature doc template, this one stoops to kindergarten level by giving names to its lead protagonists (a polar bear cub named Nanu and a walrus pup called Seela) and using some crafty editing to spin a yarn around their lives and habits. This anthropomorphic Disneyfication  presumably intended to give youngsters something to relate to  is made worse by the films elementary dialogue and Queen Latifahs crass n brash delivery.</p><p>But thats not the worst of it; theres something weird about the sound effects too. Do cute little polar bear cubs really go weeeee when falling into a hole? And do walruses really break wind in such human fashion? The consistency of the print quality also disappoints: one minute its pristine Planet Earth-style eye candy, and the next its wishy-washy stuff that looks like it was filmed on a camcorder. </p><p>But lets not be too cynical. The nub of the film is to recruit more children to the great ecological cause and in that respect it succeeds. Its also refreshing to see a child-friendly nature film that doesnt shy away from harsh realities. Which prompts the following parental warning: Nanus nameless little brother doesnt make it. Sorry, thought you should know.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Cheerfully bucking the trend for dark, miserablist blockbusters, Lost creator JJ Abrams has updated the Star Trek franchise for the twenty-first century without resorting to political allegory, moral wrangling or the sadistic violence that characterised similar reinventions like The Dark Knight. Its true that an entire planet gets blown up, but the characters swiftly recover on their way to another round of phaser-firing, evasive-manouevring, quip-trading action.<br />The script details the early years of captain-to-be James T Kirk (Chris Pine) and his taciturn Vulcan sidekick Spock (Zachary Quinto) and is deceptively clever: it works both as affectionate fanboy nostalgia and as a neophytes introduction to the Trek-verse. By employing a time-distorting narrative, complete with mind-mangling multi-dimensional techspeak, Abrams and his writers allow themselves to refit this fictional future completely, keeping the good stuff (beaming up, warp drives, that inimitable ship design) while jettisoning most of the increasingly convoluted mythology.<br />It doesnt all work: Eric Banas Romulan villain feels too familiar, just another plasticine-headed psychopath with a grudge against the universe. The climax, too, is undercooked: ten minutes of noisy ship-to-ship combat with very little emotional investment.<br />But these are minor complaints when stacked against Abramss many successes. The flawless design wittily updates the 60s series sleek art deco interiors and throws in a few Lycra miniskirts for good measure. The cast are equally strong: Quinto brings wry charm to an otherwise calculating character, while Pine powers through his performance in bullish, if not quite Shatner-esque fashion. The only sore thumb is Karl Urbans McCoy, whose Damn it, Jim! impersonation feels a little too close to pastiche.<br />The overall impression is one of unbridled enthusiasm on the part of the films makers, both for its predecessors and for the brave new universe Abrams and his crew are exploring. Perhaps the best summary of the film comes from Captain Kirk himself, dying on the side of a distant interstellar rock many decades later: It was fun.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A fascinatingly strange (and strained) midlife-crisis movie, Slava Tsukermans quasihistorical drama unspools in the year 1992, when astrophysicist Sasha (Robards) returns to Moscow from his 17-year exile to encounter thawing political conditions and unresolved affairs. Toggling between Soviet-era flashbacks and contemporary cocktail parties, <i>Perestroika</i> is refreshingly heady, taking cues from scientific ideas (voiced, authoritatively, by F. Murray Abrahams mentor figure) as well as the titular restructuring afoot. Writer-director Tsukerman (<i>Liquid Sky</i>) creates an artificial flow of video backdrops and sound dubbing, resulting in something decidedly awkward, yet fetchingly personal.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This mildly appealing mini-budget odyssey follows the (mis)adventures of young holidaying New Yorker Max (musician Sean Bones Sullivan). Moving from drunken nights on a cruise bound for Jamaica, through a roots travelogue across the island  Max is robbed of everything short of his underpants on Mahogany Beach; watches his cruise ship sail off without him; sees in Obamas victory in a dancehall in St Catherine; is threatened with a knife outside Kingston  the movie alternates from bad experience to good before attempting a final meeting of the two. The film is mercifully lacking in hyperbole its indie/mumblecore quirks are not excessive, excepting an over-emphatic Apocalypse Now-style sequence featuring a mystic rasta, played by The Harder They Comes Carl Bradshaw. The soundtrack features a mix of New York rock bands (MGMT, Yeasayer), Jamaican reggae and dancehall.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Pornography: A Thriller </i>may have a few interesting things to say about porn. But thrills? Not so much. What begins as an ambitious, segmented meditation on a missing gay-porn star (Grey) and the journey of one writer (Montgomery) into a violent, voyeuristic heart of darkness eventually devolves into a routine Lynchian head trip. The long, strange trip of another stud-for-hire (Scherer) experiencing haunted dreams completes the narrative three-way. Taken independently, these chapters probe the thorny porn starviewer exchange, but Kittredge cant connect the dots into a worthy climax. In other words: all foreplay, no full release.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Prison as a hothouse for untapped aggression is again the order of the day in this snarling but predictable survival tale in which we follow three teenage tykes as they navigate their way through juvie. Heavily inspired by Alan Clarkes Scum, the film recasts Ray Winstones iconic, jowly daddy as the vaguely preppy firecracker Butch (Adam Butcher  highly watchable), whose tormenters discover his anger-management issues via the business end of a tin mug. Director Kim Shapiron channels Larry Clarks interest in adolescent nihilism and impulsiveness in his depiction of these youths and draws on his experiences of horror (2006s Sheitan) for a sense of doom. Technique aside, the material brings little new to the prison movie, working standard moral panics about prison as a questionable tool for rehab and always a bit too ready to quash any hope under its standard-issue boot heel.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An improvement on his lamentable comedy-horror hybrid The Cottage but lacking the violent gusto of his debut London to Brighton, Paul Andrew Williamss claustrophobic third feature deals in the queasy minutiae of a suburban home invasion. Its basically a Zone Two Straw Dogs, pitting unscrupulous hoodies against the affluent, M&amp;S <i>diner  deux</i> set. The film opens on a blunt metaphor  a boiling pan of broccoli  before detailing how an average middle-aged, middle-class couple (Tom Butcher and Rachael Blake) have their enjoyment of said broccoli ruined by tooled-up youths who barge into the house, tie them up and threaten them with violence. The kids have no rational motives and the film perpetuates patronising myths about the savagery of delinquents, attempting to justify their actions by having them spout buzz words: Drugs! Alcohol! Abuse! Poverty! The acting is decidedly ropey, the dialogue is repetitive and the provocative (though expertly mounted) open ending gives the impression of being deeper than it actually is.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Shes 40, broody and single, so TV production assistant Jennifer Aniston decides to have a child via a sperm donor. As the title pretty much gives away, complications with two different helpings of man-seed lie ahead. But what the title and marketing dont tell you is that Aniston is essentially a secondary character. The focus is actually on her unattached best friend Jason Batemans discovery that he may not be much of a lover but hes a great father. Curiously, he comes on like a latterday Tony Randall, a charming neurotic seemingly at the closeted end of the asexual spectrum. Batemans performance  as a broker shedding his anxious reserve when its his turn to look after Anistons melancholy little boy (Thomas Robinson, a real discovery)  is funny, touching and observed in micro-detail throughout.<br />Like the directing duos 2007 ice-skating frolic Blades of Glory, the film consequently dangles uneasily between quirky and mainstream. Josh Gordon and Will Speck treat the central switcheroo narrative like the chore it is and can do little with the grinding plot mechanics that turn Aniston and her donor-of-choice (Patrick Wilson) into cardboard cyphers. When Bateman and Robinson are on screen, though, its a different movie, striking a witty note of nervy authenticity as two misfit males from different generations care and share together. With Jeff Goldblum chiming in usefully as Batemans sardonic boss, theres much to enjoy, if not quite enough to disguise the films essential awkwardness in trying to cover too many bases.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One can argue about the quality of Danny Dyer and Tamer Hassans blokey films, most of which are glorified straight-to-DVD titles, but theres no questioning their work ethic. Here they are again, in an under-populated thriller about seven lost souls wandering the streets of a post-apocalyptic London. None of them knows what day it is (Judgement Day, perhaps), but memory flashes suggest they have something in common. But what could connect Hassans army sergeant, a drunken civil servant, a stroppy teenager, a God-botherer, an army captain in civvies, a woman who speaks no English and a journalist called William Blake? Director Imran Naqvi exploits the eeriness of the empty City, but the promising set-up fades away. The underrated Hassan has presence, and pretty much carries the film on his broad shoulders; Dyers enigmatic, non-speaking role will be a relief to some. The surprise ending is not unexpected.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The title of Hong's comedy of manners and mores, taken from a Louis Aragon poem, is gently misleading: the woman here, bar-owner Sun-Hwa (Sung), is actually a figure from the pasts of the two men, aspiring film-maker Kim (Kim) and university lecturer Lee (Yu). Both men had affairs with her in their student days, although they recall her very differently. And when they meet for the first time in some years (Kim has been studying in the US) they decide to look her up - and both of them fall for her all over again. The fact that Lee is now married is only one of the complications which affect the resulting triangle of jealousies, rivalries and generally less than great sex. As usual, Hong loads the film with neat symmetries and patterns of repetition/variation, but there's less formalist play with narrative structures than before. (Maybe the French co-producer's demand for cuts forced him to axe some of his ideas this time?) Still, it's funny, wry and emotionally acute.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Choderlos de Laclos' 18th century novel is a monument to lust, guilt and duplicity, written in letter form. One of the film's enormous strengths is scriptwriter Christopher Hampton's decision to go back to the novel, and save only the best from his play. Frears, under commercial pressure but also determined to start afresh, has chosen American actors for the main roles: Malkovich as the professional philanderer Valmont; Close as the sadistic aristocrat with whom he plots to ruin both a social union and a virtuous woman (Pfeiffer, splendid). The result is a sombre, manipulative affair in which the dcor is never allowed to usurp our interest. Broader, nastier even than the play, it uses recurring epistolary motifs, shadow and close-up to convey the themes of the piece: the relationships between pleasure and pain, our inability to control others, our endless desire to do so. Malkovich's final demise, run through, wasted and resigned, recalls the misty-eyed days of Fairbanks and Flynn; while Close, all eye-contact, front, and self-possession, ends the film unforgettably as a sacrificial lamb on the altar of decency.]]></review>

There are no explanations and no motivations, except perhaps for a hint of allegory in the script (the motorist's name is Mann) and an intriguing visual suggestion that this is the old, old battle between the shining, prancing, vulnerable knight and the impervious, lumbering dragon. Simply a rivetingly murderous game of cat and mouse that keeps you on the edge of your seat.]]></review>

More importantly, it parades a streamof brilliant Howard Dietz-Arthur Schwartznumbers. Astaire is superlative in several items, notably 'By Myself' (a solitary introspection which opens the show with a purr), 'A Shine on Your Shoes', and (with Charisse) the gorgeous 'Dancing in the Dark'. So he can be forgiven for trying to do a Gene Kelly in the 'Girl Hunt' ballet ( a parody of Mickey Spillane sleaze more notable for Michael Kidd's choreography and Charisse's startlingly sinuous femme fatale). All this and witty dialogue too. A treat.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A pair of provincial con-men (Crawford and Basehart) pose as priests to swindle ignorant peasant farmers, but what begins as comedy turns sour, cruel, and finally tragic. Characteristically, Fellini stacks the pack with a final victim of great facial beauty, palsied legs and obscurantist belief, after which it is only a matter of time before bad Brod receives his comeuppance on a stony hillside. Most of Fellini's preoccupations are present, but in 1955 had not yet blown the obligation to tell a story off-course.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Based on Harlan Ellison's novella, this covers familiar territory - vigorously and imaginatively - as feuding clans of scavengers prowl the desolate American landscape left by a nuclear holocaust. What lifts things right out of the rut is the cynical commentary provided by the hero's dog, communicating telepathically (in voice-off admirably spoken by Tim McIntire) and kicking the daylights out of all those boy-and-his-dog yarns (canine values win out, for example, when with barely a qualm the hero consigns his girl to serve as dogfood). The second half, venturing underground to find Middle America miraculously preserved but rapidly dying, is less good. Jones' debut as a director nevertheless has a distinctive tang, as affably unprincipled as the series of villains he played for Sam Peckinpah.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The years since 1977 have shrunk <i>Star Wars</i>, but <i>Close Encounters</i> looks more classic than ever, an insane burst of cinematic optimism which somehow combines Disney and '50s SF and the imagery of junk food into the most persuasive (if arrested) version of the American dream yet accomplished. Now Spielberg has added some new special effects, but more importantly, he has cut and altered the central section concerning Dreyfuss' obsession with the image of Devil's Tower, Wyoming. These scenes, formerly hysterical and unconvincing, are now more potent, leaving Truffaut's slightly mannered performance as one of the film's few awkward areas. It is now also easier, following Spielberg's <i>1941</i>, to see why <i>Close Encounters </i>works so well: the child's bedroom scene where all the toys come alive has more adrenalin in it than a dozen demolitions.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ren Clment and Chabrol's collaborator Paul Ggauff got hold of Patricia Highsmith's <i>The Talented Mr Ripley</i> decades before Wim Wenders laid hands on the novelist's psychopathic protagonist in <i>The American Friend</i>. In his third film appearance, 24-year-old Delon exudes icy charm as Ripley, the emissary sent by an American industrialist to rescue his son (Ronet, sublimely dissolute) from yachting decadence. Delon, though, has a killer scheme of his own - murder the guy, pocket the loot, and steal his girl (Lafort). Easy. It just takes a thread of steel in the nerves - and a director with the stealth and patience to wind up the tension and avoid rushing the pay-off. Audiences weaned on switchback cutting and adrenalin pace will have to adjust, but even the admittedly clunky first 30 minutes make sense in retrospect. Delon's determined chill aside, there's much to enjoy: a narrative stitched together with old school expertise; vivid marine camerawork by Henri Deca; a startling rinky-dink piano score by Nino Rota.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When Father Greg (Roache) arrives at his new Liverpool parish, he's appalled at what he regards as the lax morals of his more experienced colleague, Father Matthew (Wilkinson), who shares a bed with their housekeeper Maria (Tyson). The priests are utterly at odds, temperamentally, politically and doctrinally. However, it soon emerges that Greg's fierce conservatism covers a turmoil of self-doubt: one evening he swaps his dog collar for a leather jacket and picks up a lover in a gay bar (Carlyle). The film calls on the traditions of the best radical TV drama. Wickedly sardonic and very moving, with an outstanding performance from Roache at the centre of a fine cast, it clearly works a treat for cinema audiences. In the opening sequence a priest uses a large crucifix as a battering ram, which gives a fair idea of the level of ecclesiastical debate. The film's true subject, however, is emotional courage, and that it has in spades.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA['A William Dear Film'? Come off it, this has Steven Spielberg, whose Amblin company produced, written all over it. While the Hendersons are on a hunting holiday, their car collides with the legendary Bigfoot of the Pacific Northwest. Mistakenly believing the Yeti-like creature dead, they take him to their Seattle home, which he promptly demolishes before proving himself a genial giant of enormous compassion. Neverthe-less, nosey neighbours and fame-hungry hunters smell something suspicious, and pretty soon the gun-crazy citizens of Seattle are on the trail of the hapless, hirsute 'Harry'. This cloying mixture of sitcom and fantasy is clearly designed to pluck the heart-strings, tickle the funnybone, and sow seeds of doubt about the moral worth of hunting.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For all its sentimentality, this overshadows virtually everything Fellini has made since <i>La Dolce Vita</i>. As ever for <i>il maestro</i>, life is both cyclic odyssey and circus, a teeming, tragicomic arena of pain, cruelty and solitude. Masina plays Gelsomina, a nave waif whose simpleton innocence provides a direct line to life's eternal mysteries; when she is sold into virtual slavery to play clown to itinerant strongman Zampano (Quinn), the boorish brute simply exploits his new assistant's desire for affection at every opportunity. It's basically a road movie: she vainly tries to escape, they join a circus, and her friendship with the tightrope-walking Fool (Basehart) brings its own problems. Despite the pessimism of much of the story, memorably embodied in the grey, desolate towns the pair visit, Fellini has already moved far from his roots in neo-realism; symbols, metaphors, and larger-than-life performances hold sway, and moments of bizarre if inconsequential charm abound.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Despite cries of outrage from hard-line Chandler purists, this is, along with Hawks' <i>The Big Sleep</i>, easily the most intelligent of all screen adaptations of the writer's work. Altman in fact stays pretty close to the novel's basic narrative (though there are a couple of crucial changes), but where he comes up with something totally original is in his ironic updating of the story and characters: Gould's Marlowe is a laid-back, shambling slob who, despite his incessant claim that everything is 'OK with me,' actually harbours the same honourable ideals as Chandler's Marlowe; but those values, Altman implies, just don't fit in with the neurotic, uncaring, ephemeral lifestyle led by the 'Me Generation' of modern LA. As Marlowe attempts to protect a friend suspected of battering his wife to death, and gets up to his neck in blackmail, suicide, betrayal and murder, Altman constructs not only a comment on the changes in values in America over the last three decades, but a critique of <i>film noir </i>mythology: references, both ironic and affectionate, to Chandler (cats and alcoholism) and to earlier private-eye thrillers abound. Shot in gloriously steely colours by Vilmos Zsigmond with a continually moving camera, wondrously scripted by Leigh Brackett (who worked on <i>The Big Sleep</i>), and superbly acted all round, it's one of the finest movies of the '70s.]]></review>

We then realise that what we have been watching is a film-within-a-film, and a rather odd young film-maker  who was at film school with the director of the movie we and he have been watching  latches on to the actress who was in that film Will life imitate art, or history repeat itself, or what? Such are the questions raised by Hongs movie, which succeeds both as character study and as a wry meditation both on the relationship between reality and representation and on the passing of time. Its a delicate film, as discreet in its observations as its predecessors, but no less enjoyable or impressive for all that.]]></review>

For a new book, Colin Beavan dragged his reluctant, TV-loving, fashion-fixated partner Michelle and their baby daughter into an experiment to see whether they could survive a year without mod cons: no electricity, plastic packaging, elevators or public transport and they could only use eco-friendly cleaning products and consume local produce. You could argue that having cameras around gave the couple more impetus to continue, especially when the chips were down. You could also argue that Beavan was simply attracting publicity for his book. Yet theres something engagingly honest about the modern day Good Life couples efforts to adapt that makes this fly-on-the-wall documentary both entertaining and faintly inspirational.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A delightfully outlandish comic strip directed by the master of the Italian B movie, a former cameraman who could always be relied on to ravish the eye with wonderfully bizarre imagery. Part James Bond parody, part Feuillade serial, it sends itself up as cheerfully as anything else as its hero dallies with his beloved under a snowfall of banknotes or prowls about his nefarious (but always chivalrous) purposes in black leotards, armed with suction pads that turn him into a human fly. But from time to time it also hits a high note of fantasy worthy of Cocteau, notably in a scene where Diabolik, encased in plumes of molten gold, is transformed into a living statue by his arch-enemy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[David Thomson calls Clouzot's a 'cinema of total disenchantment'. This expos of a malicious small town in France must be one of the most depressed films to emerge from the period of the German Occupation: everyone speaks badly of everyone else, rumours of abortion and drug addiction are rife, and a flood of poison-pen letters raises the spiteful hysteria to epidemic level. Clouzot's misanthropy concludes in total defeat; his naggingly over-insistent style occasionally achieves a great blackness.]]></review>

One of Ealing's first postwar successes, it is given an enormous boost by locations around the bomb sites of London's East End and by Sim's sinister eccentricities as the author of the serial in question. Its charm, in these days of headlines about kids and video nasties, is of another world: capturing a blonde moll (White) and requiring information, the gang subject her to the most vicious tortures they can think of - tickling by feather (which doesn't work) and menace by white mouse (which does).]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The opening credit sequence artfully mimics the reassuring tone of Disney does Rodgers and Hammerstein and introduces the diminutive heroes, third-graders Stan, Cartman, Kenny and Kyle. Their first port of call, however, is a movie house, where they bribe a bum to walk them into the R-rated comedy 'Asses of Fire', starring the scatological Canadian clowns Terrance and Philip. The boys emerge with a new vocabulary they can't wait to show off, and pressing questions about the nature of the clitoris. The first half hour aims low and rarely misses. A below-the-(Bible-)belt satiric assault on the pieties of the censorship brigade, this feature spinoff from the animated TV series takes no prisoners, and blows gratuitous raspberries at the Baldwin brothers, Saddam Hussein and Winona Ryder among others. Genuinely outrageous and sometimes hilarious - but size does eventually matter, and all-rounder Trey Parker just can't keep it up for the full 81 minutes.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Heres an odd wisp of heritage drama, adapted from a story by William J Locke and directed by journeyman actor Dance. He presents a formidable grande-dame pair  Judi Dench and Maggie Smith  as symbiotic sisters living out their twilight years in 1936 Cornwall, where handsome shipwreck <br />victim Daniel Brhl (Good Bye Lenin!) washes ashore one unassuming day. While the mysterious young man, who doesnt speak a word of English, heals up in their spare bedroom, sensible sis Janet (Smith) attempts communicating with him in German, flightier Ursula (Dench) develops a secret but fiery crush on him, and out-of-towner Natascha McElhone whisks the lad away to nurture his soon-evident violin-playing talent. Its all as postcard-pretty, pleasantly dull, and wholly inconsequential as it may sound; Dance tiptoes around Ursulas suppressed desires so nervously that her character remains frustratingly oblique, though the redoubtable team of Dench and Smith have a prickly but affectionate rapport that feels decades lived-in.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A truly lovely film from first-time Egyptian director Kolirin which should satisfy anyone with a soft spot for the deadpan likes of Jarmusch or Kaurismki. We join the Alexandria Ceremonial Police Band (decked out in decidedly loud blue suits) as they arrive in a small Israeli town to play a concert at the local culture centre. Quickly realising they've made a wrong turn along the way, they grudgingly accept the sanctuary of a kind hearted bar owner and decide to spend a single night in this nowhere town. Themes of cultural and political displacement, as well as the joys of serendipity, are subtly and skillfully enmeshed in what is essentially a joyous, big-hearted and extremely satisfying comedy of manners.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Less metaphysical, or physical, than Romance or Anatomy of Hell, less naturalistic than A Ma Soeur!, less self-reflexive than Sex Is Comedy, and  notwithstanding the presence of Asia Argento  less provocative than any of the above, Catherine Breillats latest is as philosophically rigorous and psychologically revealing as anything shes made. For once in her remarkable career, the French writer-director has elected to adapt someone elses material: the eponymous nineteenth-century novel by Jules Barbey dAurevilly.<br />The film centres on a question considered and discussed by a bride-to-bes open-minded grandmother and her judgemental, gossiping friends: would the womanising but impoverished aristocrat, Ryno de Marigny (Fuad At Aattou) be willing or able to give up his mistress, La Vellini (Argento) upon his marriage to the virtuous and wealthy Hermangarde (Breillat regular, Roxane Mesquida)? After all, their passionate affair has already survived ten years.<br />Swiftly and deftly immersing us in the fashions  not just the clothes and decor, but also the changing sexual and social ethics  of the 1830s, Breillats meticulous, eloquent script and direction succeed in relating a rich, complex, consistently engrossing story and in providing an insightful commentary on the mores and literary concerns of the time. Argento has never been better, Mesquida and the supporting actors are strong, and Fuad At Aattou is a real find, his androgyne beauty splendidly cast, his dbut performance subtle and assured. Witty yet grave, incisive and utterly unsentimental, the film is also  thanks to Yorgos Arvanitis camerawork and some judiciously chosen music  wonderfully elegant.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hong's third feature is built on the same narrative intricacies and ambiguities as before, but it extends the uncertainty principle into the areas of memory and subjective consciousness. Soojung (Lee), a bright young woman who has been saving her virginity for the right man, is quite close to her married boss Youngsoo (Moon) but finds herself more attracted to his gallery-owning friend Jaehoon (Jung), eventually promising to go to bed with him. The film is in five chapters; the first, third and fifth detail events on the day Soojung is supposed to surrender her virginity to Jaehoon in a Seoul hotel room. The longer second and fourth chapters offer different and mutually contradictory takes on the earlier stages in their relationship, reflecting the different perceptions, memories and fantasies of the three central characters. Often very funny and always spot-on in its observation of middle-class mores and secrets.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The near future: taking a job and a bedsit at a shabby rooming-house above a butcher's shop, ex-clown Louison (Pinon) falls for the butcher's daughter. But her father, unhappy about the blossoming romance, deals in human flesh: will Louison fall victim, or will the Troglodistes, an underground group of vegetarian fanatics, come to his rescue? On to this slim story, writer-directors Jeunet and Caro pile a wealth of delicious comic detail. Each grotesquely larger-than-life inhabitant of the scrofulous tenement has his own little story; visually, the film evokes Gilliam, Lynch, the Coens and Carn, but the allusions never get in the way of the nightmarish humour. The sets, special effects, photography, pace and performances all contribute to the brash comic-strip vivacity, and even the fairytale romance avoids sentimentality. Increasingly inventive as it progresses, Jeunet and Caro's fast, funny feature debut entertains from sinister start to frantic finish.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When a small New Zealand town is overrun by man-eating space aliens, it's left to gawky Derek (Jackson) and the Alien Investigation Defence Service (spot the horrible pun) to deal with them. Within the opening five minutes, one such extraterrestrial has half his head blown off. Derek himself suffers the indignity of having a cat-flap incorporated into the back of his skull, whence fall large amounts of brain matter, some of it to be replaced with assorted bowel matter. Made over four years on an incredibly low budget, the film has its moments, though ironically most of the best jokes have nothing to do with the gore: some terrifically banal conversations pass between the members of the AIDS team, and there are a few fine sequences of Three Stooges-type slapstick. Things hot up in the last 20 minutes, when Peter Jackson stops chucking intestines around and gets some serious hardware under way - we're talking rocket launchers and big chainsaws, equipment essential to the success of any movie. Indeed, a climatic rebirth-by-chainsaw scene almost makes it all worthwhile, though you may have had to visit the bathroom once or twice in the wait.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Having distributed <i>El Topo</i> to cult success in the United States, former Beatles lawyer Allen Klein co-produced Jodorowsky's more lavishly funded follow-up, in which the Chilean maverick unleashes wave after wave of religious symbolism, would-be spiritual gobbledygook and violently surreal imagery (memorably, small birds emerging from gunshot wounds). The connecting narrative, broadly, involves a Christ figure seeking enlightenment under the tutelage of 'The Alchemist' (Jodorowsky himself, in flowing robes and very tall hat), as a group of astrologically significant individuals set out to scale the legendary Holy Mountain and replace the all-powerful beings residing on its peak. With Jodorowsky's meaning somewhat opaque, it's slightly tedious going, but you certainly get plenty to look at, what with costumed frogs and lizards re-enacting the conquest of Mexico, the plucky armless dwarf, and (don't snigger) the scene where the protagonist has his excreta distilled while a naked woman plays cello and a pelican lurks portentously in the background. We will not see its like again.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Not content with setting itself in London's Asian community, this also tells a gay love story. Daniel Day Lewis gives a luminous performance as the white ex-National Front hoodlum who befriends an Asian (Warnecke) and helps him create his commercial dream, a laundrette which glitters like a Hollywood picture palace. The fact that Lewis finds himself demoted in the ensuing suds war is typical of Hanif Kureishi's script, which refuses to push Asians into their customary dramatic role as victims. Instead, they're seen as rapacious businessmen, pedalling furiously on their Tebbitite cycles, and therefore puzzled, as well as angered, by the vicious prejudice they suffer at the hands of the establishment. Saeed Jaffrey is marvellous as the smoothest of the smooth operators, and Frears directs in his customarily unfussy style. But the strength of the film is its vision - cutting, compassionate and sometimes hilarious - of what it means to be Asian, and British, in Thatcher's Britain.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>No, this surfing penguin flick isnt a hastily-scrambled sequel to Happy Feet. Far from it. In fact, Ash Brannon and Chris Buck have come up with a completely unique approach to the animated film structure, and in doing so have created the worlds first animated mockumentary. It begins with an interview with obstreperous surfer, Cody Maverick (voiced by Shia LaBeouf), who tells us how much he aspires to the skills of the late Z (Jeff Bridges), the dudiest wave-rider in penguin history; amusingly, while Cody reminisces about the past, a selection of archive footage and old snapshots add comic illustration. Later, when Codys given a break in the Big Z Memorial Surf-off Contest, the film beds down into a more conventional format, replete with social messages about self esteem, being yourself and so on.</p><p>The visuals here are mostly impressive, although more attention appears to have been paid to the casts superb facial expressions than to the rendering of the water and backgrounds. Also, one suspects the majority of verbal and visual quips will sail right over the heads of youngsters. In that respect, and despite the characters inherent cuteness, its arguably the most adult-orientated CGI animation yet. It certainly tickled this writers funnybone.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Little in life is as frustrating as a film that should be effortlessly brilliant but cant quite make it happen. The true story of The Runaways  five LA teens who formed an all-girl rock group and had a fistful of classics before imploding amid self-righteous recrimination  reads like the archetypal rock biopic plot. Pop-vid veteran Floria Sigismondi shoots with gorgeous, sun-kissed super-saturation and her recreation of the sleazy 70s proto-punk scene is flawless. <br />Even the mainstream cast  including Dakota Fanning and pouty Twilight misanthrope Kristen Stewart  seems to be having fun with the juicy riot-grrrl roles. Fanning is particularly impressive as exploited pubescent princess Cherie Currie, whose downfall forms the films central thread.<br />But, perhaps owing to Sigismondis lack of long-form experience, it never comes together. Isolated scenes look stunning but The Runaways never establishes a consistent mood, hopping from rebellious exuberance to doom-laden music industry critique. It doesnt help that the scripts central point, about the exploitation of young girls, is contradicted by the material  Joan Jett became one of rocks most respected women  and undermined by a camera which lingers lovingly, even leeringly, on 16-year-old Fannings scantily clad body. The result is an entertaining mess: lively and stylish, but frustratingly inconsequential.]]></review>

Step forward Russell Braddon, Aussie author of <i>Year of the Angry Rabbit</i>, which producer AC Lyles recklessly decided to turn into a movie. The Lyles policy (see his numerous B-Westerns) of packing the cast with fading middle-aged stars has a certain gloomy fascination, as does the whole idea of rampaging bunnies emitting leopard-like growls as they bound along in slow-motion, intent on devouring the likes of DeForest Kelley.

Few surprises in the story, but the location work in the bustling Docklands captures a time and place now gone forever.

      <review><![CDATA[Lyne's chilling film bombed in the States, probably because of its origins in the murkier side of the now done-to-death Vietnam War. But, messy and maddening though some of it is, <i>Jacob's Ladder</i> is also a truly scary film which is never simply a war or horror vehicle. Jacob Singer (Robbins) is a man whose life totters continually between past, present and future, between reality and terrifying illusion brought on by his experiences in Vietnam, where his unit was dosed with a vicious derivative of LSD to improve its killing power. Where the problem arises is that this scenario is only one alternative in the life of a man variously shown as divorced, studying and co-habiting, married and prosperous with children, or dead on a Vietnam field-hospital table. But Lyne's giddying, unsettling direction conjures up moments of horrifying hallucinogenic power from the bad-trip hell of his protagonist.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Following box office disappointments like The Spirit, Watchmen and Scott Pilgrim, could Jonah Hex finally call time on Hollywoods love affair with the online fanboy community and the obscure comic-book titles theyre so obsessed with? Its already sunk in the States but that could have as much to do with the poor quality of the movie as the unfamiliar material. Its the 1870s, and Jonah (Josh Brolin), a hideously scarred Civil War veteran, is seeking revenge on the Confederate general (John Malkovich) who murdered his family. Oh, and for reasons left largely unexplained, he can talk to the dead.<br /><br />Its this kind of headscratching development that makes Jonah Hex feel like a film aimed squarely at fans: uninitiated viewers will find themselves perplexed and quickly annoyed by the scripts tendency to throw talking corpses, mutant cage fighters and mysterious chemical weapons into what might have been a perfectly serviceable action western. At 81 minutes with credits, Jonah Hex feels crude, lazy and entirely perfunctory.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A minor sensation in Japan where questions were asked in parliament, this noisy and bombastic adaptation of a recent pulp novel doesn't shape up as satire or death-sport fantasy. In the near future, the authorities respond to an epidemic of juvenile delinquency by hijacking one problem class each year to an island and ordering the kids to kill each other, leaving only one survivor. This year's choice is Class B from Zentsuji Middle School, apparently because one pupil knifed teacher Kitano (Takeshi, the sole redeeming feature). The opening shows that the massacres are big media events, but the kids here have never heard of the game before. Maybe that's why their kills are so bloodless and lacking in hardcore nastiness. Or maybe the problem is simply that veteran Fukasaku is past it. His view of teenage life (flashbacks to happier days strumming guitar in the school dorm) is positively geriatric.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[With its plot focusing on Charlie's love for a blind flower-seller and his attempts to get enough money to pay for an eye operation, <i>City Lights</i> edges dangerously close to the weepie wonderland of <i>Magnificent Obsession</i> and other lace-handkerchief jobs. This horrid fate is narrowly avoided by bracing doses of slapstick (the heroine unravels Charlie's vest thinking it's her ball of wool) and Chaplin's supreme delicacy in conveying all shades of human feeling. Matters aren't helped by the film's structure, which is as tattered and baggy as the tramp's trousers. But there are plenty of great moments, and the occasional comic use of sound (despite its date, the film is silent) is beautifully judged.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Not a Broadway-based musical but a screen original, derived from Colette's short novel set in turn-of-the-century Paris, with famous if vapid songs by Lerner and Loewe ('I Remember It Well', 'Thank Heaven for Little Girls'). But the dominating creative contribution comes from Minnelli and Cecil Beaton (responsible for production design and costumes). The combination of these two visual elitists is really too much - it's like a meal consisting of cheesecake, and one quickly longs for something solid and vulgar to weigh things down. No doubt inspired by the finicky, claustrophobic sets and bric--brac, the cast tries (with unfortunate success) to be more French than the French, especially Chevalier. The exception is Gingold, who inhabits, as always, a world of her own.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In 1946 a young New England banker, Andy Dufresne (Robbins), is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to life at the Shawshank State Prison - twice over. Quiet and introspective, he gradually strikes up a friendship with the prison 'fixer', Red (Freeman), and over the next two decades wins the trust of the governor and guards, but in his heart, he still yearns for freedom. Darabont's adaptation of a Stephen King novella is a throwback to the kind of serious, literate drama Hollywood used to make (<i>Birdman of Alcatraz</i>, say) though the big spiritual resolution takes some swallowing - ditto the colour-blind relationships within the prison and the violent disavowal of any homosexual implications. Against this weighs the pleasure of discovering a first-time director with evident respect for the intelligence of his audience, brave enough to let character details accumulate without recourse to the fast-forward button. Darabont plays the long game and wins: this is an engrossing, superbly acted yarn, while the Shawshank itself is a truly formidable mausoleum.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The only Yuletide favourite to pivot around an attempted suicide, Capras post-war fable is a fascinating melange of social and personal impulses and the questionable charms of home. James Stewart is impeccable as George Bailey, the Bedford Falls boy-next-door whose dreams are continually deferred by the demands of family and national upset: rather than exploring and building new worlds, he runs a building society, marries and raises children. Mapping his frustrations and joys onto the contours of recent US history, Its a Wonderful Life puts individual and group interests in tension. Denied the opportunities for individualist enterprise that are the stock in trade of American cinematic heroism, George is pulled towards communal effort and self-effacement. Yet the films bravura fantasy sequence, imagining the hellishly licentious Bedford Falls that would exist without George, makes the grandest possible case for the importance and uniqueness of individual agency  Battleship Potemkin this aint. Funny, compelling and moving.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Banned on its original release as 'too demoralising', and only made available again in its original form in 1956, Renoir's brilliant social comedy is epitomised by the phrase 'everyone has their reasons'. Centreing on a lavish country house party given by the Marquis de la Chesnaye and his wife (Dalio, Gregor), the film effects audacious slides from melodrama into farce, from realism into fantasy, and from comedy into tragedy. Romantic intrigues, social rivalries, and human foibles are all observed with an unblinking eye that nevertheless refuses to judge. The carnage of the rabbit shoot, the intimations of mortality introduced by the after-dinner entertainment, and Renoir's own performance are all unforgettable. Embracing every level of French society, from the aristocratic hosts to a poacher turned servant, the film presents a hilarious yet melancholic picture of a nation riven by petty class distinctions.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA['In truth you might almost say that <i>The Lodger</i> was my first picture.' Indeed, what makes the film (from a novel by Mrs Belloc Lowndes) so fascinating is the way it dissolves into pre-echoes of Hitchcock's later work. His concern with the uncertain line between guilt and innocence, his confident dismissal of the minutiae of the plot, the disturbing intrusions of fetishistic sexuality, are as apparent here as they are in<i> Psycho</i>. The tone is lighter (despite the Ripper-esque story) and the tone more superficial, but the film has its own vigorous identity, and there are moments - Novello coming out of the fog to make the lights dim and the cuckoo clock go berserk - which are memorably effective.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This labyrinthine, very well played thriller - a huge improvement on the Bryan Singer's intriguing but awkward debut, <i>Public Access</i> - never lets up. It begins with the explosion of a docked ship, before one of the two survivors goes on to detail, to the cops and the audience, the events of the previous six weeks that led him to the vessel. It's a yarn involving five criminals unwittingly brought together in a police cell due to one thing they have in common: the master criminal Keyser Soze, who may or may not exist...Working from Christopher McQuarrie's marvellously tortuous, colourful script, Singer creates a classy, thought-provoking mystery that is pleasingly old-fashioned (the settings, characters and sassy mood recall Hammett and Chandler) and absolutely modern in the sly, slightly self-conscious play it makes with myth and methods of storytelling.]]></review>

Abstract expressionist works by artists such as Billy Al Bengston, Ed Kienholz and Wallace Berman  all regular exhibitors at LAs pioneering Ferus Gallery run by Irving Blum and visionary curator Walter Hopps  are spoiled as idents and subtitles whiz across and around the screen, making the testimonies of Dennis Hopper, Frank Gehry and Dean Stockwell feel slightly redundant.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[So, yeah, in the early, like, 90s there were, like, some artists and filmmakers like Barry McGee and Shepard Fairey and Ed Templeton and and Harmony Korine who made, like, crazy street art and, like, crazy films. Some of these guys, like, loved skating and hanging out at Aaron Roses scuzzy gallery in New York called, like, Alleged. Its Rose who, like, made this vague but, like, likeable film about his friends, who say sweet but dumb things like Why have cancer? Why not be funny?. But, like, theyre obviously a decent bunch with, like, good hearts. When the 90s became the 00s, they got, like, famous and people like Pepsi gave them, like, money to do more crazy shit but with, like, logos. So how do you, like, not sell out? Its hard, man. Rose, like, lost his gallery, but then in 2004 curated a show in Cincinnatti with these guys and called it, like, Beautiful Losers. And made, like, this film. So thats cool.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Mumblecore goes mainstream! Its been on the cards for a while now  last years Apatow-goes-improv male-bonding comedy Humpday came close to breaking out of the indie ghetto  but Cyrus marks the point when this long-percolating DIY hipster subgenre, famed for its naturalistic dialogue, awkward pauses and painfully extended camera takes, finally hits the big time.<br />Its largely down to the cast: John C Reilly plays John, a divorced schlub who thinks hes hit the jackpot when he successfully hits on foxy singleton Molly (Marisa Tomei) at a swanky LA party. But theres always a catch, and in this case its Cyrus (Jonah Hill), Mollys live-at-home twentysomething son, whose Oedipal intimacy with his oblivious mum puts a spanner in Johns romantic dreams.<br />Enormous respect is due to directors Mark and Jay Duplass, whose transition to Hollywood hasnt compromised their singular filmmaking style even a fraction. The result is as warm and wise as the brothers homemade debut, The Puffy Chair, while retaining their commitment to sly genre subversion which began with disassembled horror pastiche Baghead. Cyrus can be viewed as just an effective and intimate romantic comedy, albeit with a pitch-dark edge of discomfort stemming largely from Hills chilling, revelatory performance. <br />But its also a witty reflection on Hollywoods traditional ideas of romance and family, particularly among characters of a certain age: simply by treating these characters as real, with all the uncertainty, emotional baggage and bad decisions that entails, the Duplasses expertly expose the hypocrisy of the airbrushed all-American ideal.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Inspired by the true story of Marseilles mob kingpin Jacky le Mat, who miraculously survived an assassination attempt to wreak revenge on his foes, this Gallic crime flick sticks so closely to the tried-and-trusted, its almost scared to surprise us. Thus, were meant to root for retired felon Jean Reno after surgeons remove guess-how-many lumps of lead from him because hes kind to kids, listens to opera, loves his Mama, says no to drugs  but basically because hes Jean Reno. The guys a star, for sure, but hes hardly taxing himself here. As his angry response leaves a trail of carnage across the city, the action stuff is delivered with swish professionalism, Zad Merad gets to grandstand as Renos scheming nemesis and the predictable storyline slots together with an audible clunk. Its never less than competent and stalwart Jean-Pierre Darroussin steals it as Renos smoothie lawyer but wheres the juice? Certainly nothing here to suggest it was worthy of its original French title, LImmortel.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[What is it about the 1995 Rettendon Range Rover Murders? A trio of gangland hard nuts getting offed has now inspired three feature films: 2000s Essex Boys (solid, though names were changed), 2007s Rise of the Footsoldier (a shameless cavalcade of reprehensible carnage) and now this offering, sharing a producer and some cast members with Footsoldier. The approach here is more character-based, exploring the business and personal tensions leading up to the killings, yet these remain deeply unsympathetic individuals. The portentous direction (meaningful still poses and all) is seriously out of place in a bread-and-butter, homegrown crime flick and, without a micron of audience empathy, rather academic. The majestic Tamer Hassan delivers the definitive coked-up Essex psycho performance; shame the movies not sussed enough to make much of it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Maurice Bendrix (Fiennes) is a well regarded English novelist - Graham Greene's unflattering self-portrait - whose passionate love affair with the married Sarah (Moore) leads him into a fatal duel, not with her husband, the quiescent civil servant Henry Miles (Rea), but with God Himself. If ever an actor was born to play Greene, it was surely Fiennes. So English, so civilised, and so terribly anguished. Writer/director Jordan, too, makes a good match: another glumly romantic Catholic, another fatalistic Cavalier. The film retraces the novel's looped time structure, starting in 1946, two years after the end of the affair, when Maurice takes it upon himself to have Sarah followed, on his friend Henry's behalf, of course. As his investigation proceeds (through the services of Hart's Cockney dick, Parkis), and meeting Sarah again, Maurice becomes consumed with jealousy, obsessed with the idea of uncovering evidence of his ex-lover's duplicity - instead, he finds a saint. Watered down from the novel, the metaphysics are still perilously heady stuff, but it's as a poison pen love letter that the movie compels: a torrid confession of sexual passion, delving into those tweeds and suspenders, and the rancorous diatribe of a jilted man. The performances, too, are all pitch perfect.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Visconti's version of the Dostoievsky story - about the chance encounter of a couple as she is waiting in vain for her lover, and the obsessive, panic-stricken relationship which then develops between them - later filmed by Bresson as <i>Four Nights of a Dreamer.</i> Visconti traps his characters (three excellent performances) within a claustrophobic canal-side set, and the film is a series of brief walks, chases, attempted escapes, always frustrated. Shot as neo-realist high tragedy, the film offers its characters only one strange moment of escape from their night-time obsessions - a raucous, sexual, subversive scene in a dance-hall. Then the snow comes down, and with it a chilly desperation about the extent of human self-delusion.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The opening shot shows a helicopter lifting a statue of Christ into the skies and out of Rome. God departs and paves the way for Fellini's extraordinarily prophetic vision of a generation's spiritual and moral decay. The depravity is gauged against the exploits of Marcello (Mastroianni), a playboy hack who seeks out sensationalist stories by bedding socialites and going to parties. Marcello is both repelled by and drawn to the lifestyles he records: he becomes besotted with a fleshy, dimwit starlet (Ekberg), he joins in the media hysteria surrounding a child's alleged sighting of the Virgin Mary, yet he longs for the bohemian life of his intellectual friend Steiner (Cuny). There are perhaps a couple of party scenes too many, and the peripheral characters can be unconvincing, but the stylish cinematography and Fellini's bizarre, extravagant visuals are absolutely riveting.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An accomplished film of Ronald Harwood's theatrical two-hander, animated by two gigantic performances. Finney, grossly Shakespearean as Sir, the imperious, declamatory actor-manager with a Moses-like command of his company and inanimate objects ('St-o-o-p th-a-a-a-t tr-ai-ai-n!' he bawls, bringing British Rail to its knees), is fully matched by Courtenay's pantomime poof Norman, Sir's devoted dresser: mincing, nagging, but the only one able to reach to the furthest depths of Sir's hair-tearing madness and coax him into the costumes and roles that have by wicked irony destroyed him. Especially pleasing, then, that in the final act it is the quiet craft of an actress - Atkins as the long-suffering, love-lorn stage manageress - that rises above constrictions of plot and thankless part to upstage them.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Coppola's superior sequel to his own very fine Mafia epic extends the original film's timeframe both backwards (to Vito Corleone's arrival and struggles to get by in New York at the start of the 20th century) and forwards (to his son Michael's ruthless protection of his own power as capo during a post-war period of expanded influence into Vegas, Cuba and elsewhere). The two strands alternate in Coppola's elliptical and elegantly orchestrated narrative, so that the seemingly inexorable progress from petty to corporate crime, from survival instinct to a steely obsession with power for power's sake, is charted with a terrifying lucidity. True, the film is so entranced by the dynastic dazzle that it neglects to show the Mob's baleful influence on America at large - the only people visibly harmed are either rival <i>mafiosi</i> or corrupt authority figures - but the performances, Gordon Willis' memorably gloomy camerawork, the stately pace and the sheer scale of the story's sweep render everything engrossing and so, well, plausible that our ideas of organised crime in America will forever be marked by this movie.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Platts-Mills' second feature steps up a class from working to middle, but remains as quietly and sympathetically observant as <i>Bronco Bullfrog</i>, though this time using professional actors and a bolder visual stylisation. Very much of its time in its account of a girl's attempt to escape the cosy suburbanism of her family in Esher - by way of an affair with a classless writer who introduces her to the dropout world - it remains as engagingly unclassifiable as <i>Bronco Bullfrog</i>. Well worth a look for its odd mixture of romanticism and scepticism about society's future.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Write about what you know, they say. So in 1959 Franois Truffaut, neglected son, passionate reader, delinquent student and cinephile, wrote and filmed one of the first glistening droplets of the French New Wave: The 400 Blows, in which Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Laud) demonstrates  unforgettably  that a good brain and bad parents dont necessarily turn a boy into a talented film director, although they will, one way or another, turn him into a liar.<br />Antoine is an inept thief who winds up incarcerated; somehow, Truffaut turned this saga into the most joyous experience you could have in the cinema until his Jules et Jim three years later. The beauty of monochrome 50s Paris helps, but the magic is in observing the thrill even a maltreated child will snatch from a book, a film or a day truanting at a funfair, through the gaze of a former critic whose elation at getting his hands on a camera burbles through every shot.<br />This debut made Truffauts name, and that of his alter ego, Laud. Like Fellini and Mastroianni or Scorsese and De Niro, theirs was a great collaboration: a sleight of character that conjured up a separate entity with a prettier face and a different ending. Or is it different? The famous last shot  a zoom to a freeze frame as Antoine flees reform school, truanting again but with better reason  is also a perfect depiction of Truffaut then, en route from nasty past to invisible but promising future. And isnt that where most of us are? No wonder this film never dates: he was writing about what we all know.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of the most playful of Hitchcock's British thrillers, this was adapted by Charles Bennett from Joseph Conrad's novel <i>The Secret Agent</i>, which in fact had been the title of Hitch's previous film. The foreign saboteur at large in London is cinema-owner Homolka, and in part at least, his profession allows Hitchcock to indulge in the sort of movie-movie self-consciousness of which he would become the object some 40 years on. The film proceeds from the point where the lights go out (Battersea power station is the first sabotage target), and even includes a telling screen-within-a-screen homage to Disney and the <i>Silly Symphonies</i>. The narrative's a bit perfunctory, but is neatly overbalanced by the joyously rule-breaking sequence of a boy, a bus and a time bomb.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This feature debut from Australian director Cate Shortland reminded me afterwards of two fairly recent British films, both also made by female writer-directors: Carine Adlers Under the Skin and Lynne Ramsays Morvern Callar. Indeed its easy to imagine a younger Sam Morton (who starred in both those films) stepping into this bracing and sensitive coming-of-age story if only because she is such an adept and unusual actress when exploring unspoken desire and curiosity.<br />Here, 23-year-old Australian Abbie Cornish plays Heidi, a disaffected, sexually explorative teenager who leaves home abruptly after being discovered in bed with her mothers boyfriend. Heidi heads for Lake Jindabyne, an unglamourous ski resort, where she immediately calls an old contact  a former one-night-stand we assume  who swiftly gives her the brush-off. She spends the night with a passing tourist (cue a second brush-off) and then installs herself in a local motel, takes a job at a petrol station and strikes up a relationship with Joe (Sam Worthington), the son of a wealthy local farmer. <br />Heidi is looking for security  love even  and her body is one of the few assets she possesses. Its an ugly dilemma that director Cate Shortland makes her main concern. And Cornish brilliantly indulges the ambiguity of Heidi. Is she naive? Is she manipulative? Is she smart? Is she stupid? Shes all of these, a girl unsure of herself and struggling to make sense of her life. <br />Shortland successfully transfers Heidis instability and inquisitiveness to the cold landscape around her, and so we enjoy brilliant colour washes followed by stark handheld scenes. Small moments count for a lot: the camera lingers as Heidi runs her hand over tiles or fiddles with a pot of marmalade. Its hard to explore the internal, but here we both observe Heidi and feel something of her experience too. For all this, Shortland well deserves the awards already lavished on her back home in Australia.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The last gasp of the neo-realist spirit in Visconti's work, <i>Rocco</i> chronicles at length the misfortunes that befall an Italian peasant family when they move to The Big City. There's a grey conviction about much of the scene-setting and the location shooting, but the film gathers interest as it escalates into melodrama; the tragic climax is pure opera. Delon is unconvincing as the saintly Rocco, but Renato Salvatori makes the thuggish elder brother who falls in with a gay boxing promoter his best part ever.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[As in <i>Even Dwarfs Started Small</i>, the exposition of Herzog's film about the crazy, megalomaniac dream of the Spanish Conquistadors is both functional and extremely concentrated: each scene and each detail is honed down to its salient features. On this level, the film effectively pre-empts analysis by analysing itself as it proceeds, admitting no ambiguity. Yet at the same time, Herzog's flair for charged explosive imagery has never had freer rein, and the film is rich in oneiric moments. The extraordinary, beautiful opening scene illustrates the ambivalence. In long shot, the image of the conquistadors descending the Andes pass brims with poetic resonances: the men are situated between the peaks and the valleys, between conquered land and unexplored forests, between 'heaven' and 'earth', shrouded in mists. In close-up, the procession picking its way down the narrow path is presented and defined with specific accuracy: all the leading characters are introduced, the social hierarchy is sketched (the slave porters in chains, the women carried in chairs), and the twin poles of the expedition's ideology are signified through the loads it carries (a large Madonna figure and an even larger cannon). Neither 'reading' of the action contradicts the other: they are, rather, mutually illuminating.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Fellini at his ripest and loudest recreates a fantasy-vision of his home town during the fascist period. With generous helpings of soap opera and burlesque, he generally gets his better effects by orchestrating his colourful cast of characters around the town square, on a boat outing, or at a festive wedding. When he narrows his focus down to individual groups, he usually limits himself to corny bathroom and bedroom jokes, which produce the desired titters but little else. But despite the ups and downs, it's still Fellini, which has become an identifiable substance like salami or pepperoni that can be sliced into at any point, yielding pretty much the same general consistency and flavour.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Coppola's rethink of his Vietnam War epic is intriguing, but no significant improvement. Some of the added footage is fine, some redundant. If the extra Kilgore material adds nothing, meeting the Playboy bunnies again further upriver is a touch tedious. And the lengthiest newly inserted sequence is pretty catastrophic: a visit to a French colonial plantation is dramatically ruined by incomprehensible accents, Carmine Coppola's syrupy music and a soppy sexual interlude for Sheen with simpering Aurore Clment. More Brando is fairly effective, but all the best stuff you'll have seen before. Whatever, it's wonderful to see this hallucinatory folly-cum-near masterpiece again on the big screen.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Filming <i>The Servant</i> with Harold Pinter, Losey could treat the homosexual relationship between master and manservant with both visual lan and verbal acuity. Minnelli was less lucky. Robert Anderson's sensitive if fancifully written play, about a housemaster's wife coaxing a pupil out of latent tendencies, was weakened to such a degree through the combined forces of censorship and CinemaScope that the tendencies threatened to disappear completely. Which can hardly be said for the students' garish shirts and pullovers, the phony exterior sets, or the gleaming '50s automobiles - all on constant parade. Yet the film's details - indeed, its very timidity - still ensure fascinating viewing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It won nine Oscars in 1987, but at the time Bertolucci's epic life of Harry Pu Yi seemed like a beautiful but hollow Faberg egg. Storaro's majestic camera movements, the vast sway of the crowds of eunuchs or Red Guards and the opulent golden splendour of the intoxicating design were impressive trappings for the story of a passive, unsympathetic and hardly comprehending victim of the cruel ironies of history's forward march. Viewed 16 years on, one is reminded that it was made before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, and Peploe's script can be more clearly appreciated for its prescient, elegiac quality, more evident in this 227-minute cut, which contrasts more clearly the grey tones of Pu Yi's Communist 're-education' with his serial imprisonment within the ochre walls of the Forbidden City or the marble sarcophagus of his puppet throne in Manchuria. With its slow metronomic editing, Byrne and Sakomoto's score, the lack of histrionics (especially in Lone's surprisingly dignified Emperor), the film exudes a sorrowful, meditative quality, which justifies its seeming political remove and the director's abandonment of his earlier challenging aesthetics in favour of a more accessible, 'populist' symbolism. Do films tell of their times? <i>The Last Emperor</i>, having lost its Oscar crown to the heroics of <i>The Return of the King</i>, reminds us of a more ambivalent take on history and fate, and is the richer for it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This free but sensitive adaptation of Ruth Rendell's thriller is Almodvar's most impressive film to date - darker, straighter and far more controlled than his camp extravaganzas. A story of obsession, hatred, jealousy and revenge, it concerns a young man sent to prison for his accidental involvement in a police raid that went disastrously wrong. He comes out - and he wants the crippled cop who helped to put him away. The performances are spot on, the control of pace, mood and narrative is assured, the visuals are crisp, stylish and imaginative, and the whole film has, for Almodvar, an unprecedented weight and substance.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Three has always been a magic number for South Koreas Hong Sang-soo: This is a director who loves, loves, <i>loves</i> an emotionally messy mnage  trois. So its no surprise to see another romantic trio forming at the beginning of Hongs latest, or that this bitter comedy is located squarely in his thematic comfort zone. Anyone lucky enough to have caught any of Hongs previous work knows that Director Kim (Kim Seung-woo), a filmmaker, will make a play for the attractive girlfriend (Ko) of his underling (Kim Tae-woo). Per usual, psychological pole-positioning takes place over socially awkward, alcohol-fueled dinners, and the male of the speciesself-centered, oversexed and borderline infantilegets soundly skewered. But there are some good ones out there, right? asks Kim after his conquest declares that Korean guys are the pits. Her sad smile speaks volumes.</p><p>Newcomers intoxicated by Hongs amorous pileups and power plays will hopefully treat the movie as the gateway to an incredible back catalog. But by the time the protagonist introduces another female into the mix, <i>Woman on the Beach</i> will elicit a Havent we seen this before? from the converted. The familiarity of the proceedings doesnt necessarily breed contempt, as the directors ability to nail narcissistic immaturity still yields rewards. When a potential third love triangle turns into a false alarm at the end, however, the broken cycle signals that one battered romantic is ready to move on. Its a lesson the director may want to take to heart. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hong  arguably Koreas finest filmmaker of the last decade or so  makes his first feature away from home, chronicling the experiences of a middle-aged painter who holes up in a seedy Parisian hostel, anxious that hell be arrested for smoking dope if he returns to Korea. His desultory wanderings bring him into contact with a variety of other expats, including an old flame and an art-student and her flatmate who distract him from thoughts of his wife back in Seoul <br />Hongs characteristically wry, astute dissection of the male psyche is perhaps a little overlong, but the leisurely pace fits both the gentle, compassionate tone and the overall directionlessness of the protagonist. If you dont know Hongs work, this is a good place to start; and if you enjoy Rohmers films, youll be perfectly comfortable here.]]></review>

While Fellowes is unafraid to grapple with the moral and emotional complexities of his story  particularly a stark, powerful finale  his refusal to impose any kind of real-world logic on the narrative largely restricts the films appeal to bookish pre-teens. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In 2004, residents of the Palestinian town of Budrus rallied together to protest against Israels wall of separation, which threatened to cut the villagers off from their farmland and olive groves. Using peaceful means and led by former Fatah member-turned-community organiser Ayed Morrar, the townsfolk planted themselves in the path of the bulldozers and refused to move, despite increasingly heated provocation. Bachas doc is an unemphatic, clear-sighted look at these protests and their outcome, from early town meetings to the inevitable involvement of Palestinian politicians, Israeli soldiers and international peace ambassadors. In refusing to romanticise the villagers or demonise their aggressors, she presents a stark and wholly believable portrait of the Middle East conflict in microcosm, while her welcome focus on character over political point-scoring gives Budrus a weighty emotional kick.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Franchise creator and director of the first film, Paul W S Anderson is back at the helm for the fourth Resident Evil movie, which was shot in 3D but remains just as slickly two-dimensional as its predecessors. Like a multi-levelled computer game, Resident Evil: Afterlife is just a string of self-contained set pieces, starting with an attack on the Umbrella Corporations HQ in Tokyo by the mutated warrior Alice (Milla Jovovich) and a bevy of Alice clones. Stripped of her enhanced physical powers by Umbrella supremo Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), Alice nevertheless escapes to Arcadia, a mythical Alaskan haven from the global zombie plague, and from there to the fire-ravaged ruins of Los Angeles. It is therefore a more human, vulnerable Alice who rescues her old friend Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) and hooks up with a ragtag band of survivors holed up in a zombie-besieged LA prison. Less bleak than Russell Mulcahys post-apocalyptic Extinction, Andersons Afterlife dangles the possibility of salvation. Otherwise, its the same zombie hell, but with evolved flesh-eaters that now have extendable mouth parts and lashing tentacles. Technically, its a considerable achievement, although Andersons use of 3D is often more gimmicky than one might have hoped. Still, for die-hard fans, Afterlife has the same scatter-shot appeal as Alices shotgun full of coins, which she uses to explode the heads of the slavering zombies.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When one of her friends is dragged off into the Welsh woods by a mysterious, growling beast, disturbed fantasy fan Sophie (Holly Weston) follows its trail to a derelict orphanage, unwittingly opening a can of worms involving crazed religious fervour and deranged cannibalism. Simeon Halligans homegrown parade of horror clichs is purportedly the first low-budget film shot on the new HD Red camera system and aside from the evocatively creepy location  the dilapidated remains of St Josephs Seminary in West Lancs  seasoned TV DoP Mike Costelloes cinematography is the films only redeeming feature. Steely hued and crisp as an autumn leaf, it offers some distraction from the overwrought plot, turgid dialogue, lax performances, cheesily staged atrocities and ridiculously melodramatic sound effects. The fact my nails are still intact gives some indication of this films complete lack of scares.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The view from the Trans-Siberian Express  snow-covered fields, winding ribbons of steel track cluttered with rusted locomotives, labyrinths of Soviet concrete  may be beautiful, but any sane viewer will be sick to death of it after 118 punishing minutes of Perestroika, a numb treatise on memory, recovery and grief by artist-filmmaker Sarah Turner. Consisting almost exclusively of extended camcorder shots  some taken in 1988, some 20 years later  overlaid with Turners pretentious, over-enunciated diary entries, the film is indulgent in the extreme. A shame, because when Turner peers outside her cabin  and her own headspace  to explore politics, ecology and history, she offers moments of real insight. Her photography can be stunning  as in the opening and closing views of a hazy, smouldering Lake Baikal  but its hard to see how Perestroika would have been harmed by a few cuts: say about 100 minutes.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This first, magnificent, outpouring of the sporadic genius of cinemas equivalent to JD Salinger, Terrence Malick, still seems terrifically modern. Thats partly down to the career-best performances of Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek as garbage-collector Kit and naive schoolgirl Holly (who narrates), the misfit young couple who, like savage innocents, create a brief idyll and end up leaving a trail of blood through the unforgiving Montana badlands. <br />A film of visionary realism, based on a real-life couple-on-the-run murder spree from the 50s, Badlands is as psychologically precise as it is splendidly visually observant. But it also exudes a timeless, mythical and tragic quality which is all the more remarkable for the languorous ease with which its story unfolds. <br />Infused with an uncharacterisable romanticism, and employing one of the most entrancing uses of soundtrack music  from the honey voice of Nat King Cole to the jaunty yet haunting xylophone of George Aliceson Tipton  since Pasolinis Gospel According to St Matthew, its a challengingly non-judgmental work which lulls the viewer into a sublime state of false security, the better to deliver a stunning but gentle essay on freedom and necessity, life and death.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[With the passage of time, both the strengths and flaws of Milius' 'coming of age' epic are even more immediately conspicuous than back in '78. The film charts the changes wreaked by ageing, families, reputation and Vietnam, on the lives and friendship of three top Californian surfers - irresponsible Matt (Vincent), sensitive, steady Jack (Katt) and loony Leroy the Masochist (Busey). It's easy to mock the rowdy machismo, stereotypical situations and characters, maudlin sentimentality and overblown mythologising, such as,'Who knows where the wind comes from? Is it the breath of God?' At the same time, however, it's nearly impossible to imagine anyone even attempting such an ambitious, poetic and genuinely personal movie in today's Hollywood. At its roots, it's merely a mixed-genre piece: part soap opera, part beach movie, part  <i>American Graffiti</i>-style wallow in nostalgia. But thanks to its seasonal structure (the four acts centre on oceanic movementss, opening with the South Swell of the summer of '62, and culminating in the Great Swell of spring '74), the action not only reflects various changes in the Californian Zeitgeist, but is lifted into the realm of legend. Matt, Jack and Leroy - kings of a dying race, and themselves in thrall to Surfing History as represented by their now bemused, widely neglected mentor, The Bear - virtually become one with nature, their moods echoing those of the restless sea. All this, along with the tremulous romanticism, might seem unbearably portentous were it not for some lovely comic moments - notably, Busey in the draft-dodging scenes - and the sheer exhilaration of the surfing footage.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This belongs to that least enticing of genres, the submarine movie. Yet, despite a narrative almost wholly confined to the cramped interior of a U-boat patrolling the Atlantic, it isn't hard to understand why Germany's most expensive film ever became an international hit. Apart from the fact that, like <i>Chariots of Fire</i>, it exploits a contemporary soft spot for nostalgic, non-sectarian patriotism, Petersen's shooting style displays a breathtaking, if impersonal and faintly academic, virtuosity comparable to that of Lean or Coppola. As the brilliantly deployed Steadicam whizzes through the sweaty clutter of the vessel's living quarters, the film's unfailing (and paradoxical) sense of spectacle is rendered even more dynamic by appearing about to burst at the seams of its own claustrophobia. A pity, then, that its ironies on the futility of warfare prove trite beyond belief.]]></review>

Ex-professional basketball player and journalist Kolton Lee offers his dizzyingly inept, ineffectual and condescending take on south-of-the-river urban life as Oxford-bound rich girl, Ondene (Lucy Stanhope) enters the world of freestyling (think keepie-uppie mixed with breakdancing while holding a basketball). Even as a no-nonsense genre exercise the film falls flat, with writer Michael Maynard capturing none of the texture, humour and drama of black, working-class street life. Shabbily filmed and poorly acted, its lone positive is a compellingly awful turn by Alfie (brother of Lily) Allen, whose bumbling, velour-tracksuited date-rapist is the sleaziest thing youll see this year.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A great running gag is a tricky thing to pull off: get it right and youre looking at a bottomless well of laughs, get it wrong and youve got a predictable, tiresome joke that just wont die. The Other Guys may lack depth, insight, ambition or artistic integrity. But with no less than three successful running gags  one involving four tramps having sex in a cop car  its hard to imagine a sane audience complaining.<br />The other guys are Allen (Will Ferrell) and Terry (Mark Wahlberg). Theyre decent cops stuck on desk duty in the shadow of superior officers Danson (Dwayne Johnson) and Highsmith (Samuel L Jackson). Theres a plot in there somewhere its got something to do with Steve Coogan as a corrupt businessman  but frankly its not worth thinking too much about. This is a movie with a single purpose, which it pursues with relentless efficiency and a spectacular rate of success: The Other Guys just wants to make you laugh until it hurts.<br />To this end, writer-director and regular Ferrell collaborator Adam McKay employs a catalogue of tried-and-tested techniques. There are two solidly drawn, superbly played mismatched heroes (Wahlberg has never been better). Theres the sprawling cast of lunatic suporting characters, notably Michael Keatons TLC-quoting police captain. Theres the usual unlikely romantic pairing: Ferrells nerdy, obsessive loser is married to an appealingly self-deprecating Eva Mendes. And theres a wealth of joyously berserk idiot humour, fusing slapstick and satire, surrealism and stream-of-consciousness improv into what could well prove the funniest movie of the year.]]></review>

Bridging the years, this doc follows Anker and his team back to the mountain to assess the possibility, while archive footage and thespian voiceovers piece together the Englishmans biographical details. It was made for National Geographic and it shows  meat-and-potatoes direction, obvious music  but those limitations aside, it is a fascinating story, and the HD footage from the slopes proves awe-inspiring. The landscapes look staggering on the big screen, but one suspects this is destined to be a demo disc in TV showrooms.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Drama, Thrillers]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[The French-Argentinian filmmaker Gaspar No doesnt do subtlety. Hes experimental in some ways; in others, he has the refinement of Michael Bay. His last film, 2002s backwards-told tale Irrversible, is remembered for its scenes of skull-crushing and rape. Which is a shame because its also worth recalling its technical daring  especially its illusion of long, whirling takes  and ability to hold a vice-like grip on you while telling a story of revenge gone wrong during one nasty night in Paris.<br />Enter the Void is Nos third feature and his first since the storm of Irrversible. Its a more ambitious, unwieldy project: an equally kinetic attempt, with added special effects, to capture the spirit of a city, Tokyo, and a dead young American, Oscar (Nathaniel Brown), whose ghost floats about in a vaguely Buddhist manner after being shot dead by cops soon after smoking the drug DMT.<br />Death  and maybe the DMT  cause Oscar (and so us: this is first-person cinema) to revisit the events leading to his death.We see how he started selling drugs to pay for his sister Linda (Paz de la Huerta) to join him in Tokyo; how she became a stripper; how he was screwing a friends mum; how that friend grassed on him. The seedy is the everyday. We travel further too: to Oscars childhood and an accident that orphaned him and his sister.<br />When Enter the Void first showed at Cannes last year, it was more than three hours long. But No has reached for the scissors and cut about 45 minutes, reducing the length of scenes in which the screen breaks out into fractals, echoing the look of submarine life or human capillaries or, if youre unkind, those posters which you stare at until an eagle appears.<br />If you thought the camerawork in Irrversible induced nausea, wait until you get a dose of Enter the Void. We swing in and out of buildings, tear through walls. Not only that, but we leap into the cabin of a plane and take a vaginas eye view of a penis during sex. Theres nowhere Nos camera wont go, and as his version of Tokyo is a pit of sex and drugs, were never far from a flash of flesh or a dose of dope.<br />Much about Enter the Void is rotten. The acting stinks. No drops facts like lead balloons (Hey, have you read The Tibetan Book of the Dead?). Characterisation is weak. The use of Bachs Air on a G String is lazy and emotionally the film is as shallow as a declaration of love on E. <br />But you have to admire Nos ballsy vision and loopy execution, and the way he sucks you into this world with such a bold fusion of sound and image. Its not a massive leap from Avatar to Enter the Void: both care more for style over story, both reflect their makers odd world view. No, though, has no desire to please. Hed rather repel you. See where it takes you.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its fair to say no one was expecting this. Directed by the guy who played Zed in the Police Academy movies and starring that rubber-faced bastion of family-friendly Hollywood mush known as Robin Williams (pictured below), on the surface Worlds Greatest Dad reeks of direct-to-DVD disaster. Williams plays Lance Clayton, unpublished author, uninspiring teacher and unhappy father to the most obnoxious teenage brat on the planet. Kyle (Daryl Sabara, unrecognisable from his chubby-cheeked Spy Kids days) is a grasping, hate-fuelled loser: when long-suffering Lance, possessed by compassion, quizzes his son on his idea of fun, Kyle replies, I like looking at vaginas. All day, every day.<br />There are shades of Rushmore here  remember Bill Murrays grotesque ginger kids?  and the script plays on the same sense of bittersweet longing and middle-aged desperation. But writer-director Bobcat Goldthwaits vision is far grimmer than Wes Andersons: a better comparison might be Woody Allens bitter and twisted early 90s movies, particularly the jawdroppingly cynical and foulmouthed Deconstructing Harry.<br />With Lance, Goldthwait has handed Williams the role of a lifetime, and he responds with the boldest, most heartfelt turn of his career: when tragedy strikes and the movie shifts from darkly funny to outright bleak, his warmth is the only thing preventing the film from spiralling into a black hole of misanthropy. That it avoids cynicism to become a warped but euphoric tribute to human endurance merely confirms the film as the bravest, smartest comedy of the year.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Tati's most consistently enjoyable comedy, a gentle portrait of the clumsy, well-meaning Hulot on vacation in a provincial seaside resort. The quiet, delicately observed slapstick here works with far more hits than misses, although in comparison with, say, Keaton, Tati's cold detachment from his characters seems to result in a decided lack of insight into human behaviour. But at least in contrast to later works like <i>Playtime</i> and <i>Traffic</i>, there's enough dramatic structure to make it more than simply a series of one-off gags.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[David Jones' film of Helene Hanff's book, recording the bizarre transatlantic relationship between a New York bibilophile and a London bookseller, comes as a pleasant surprise. Though inevitably literary in tone - the letters between Hanff and the Marks employees structure the narrative - it is never less than intelligent, touching, humorous. Central to this success is the subtle contrast between the austerity of postwar London and the comparatively bright affluence of Hanff's New York; also rewarding is the way images wittily counterpoint and comment on the lovingly intoned letters. And the film somehow manages to convey Hanff's almost sensual passion for pages bound in leather and still resounding with the pleasurable reactions of previous readers. None of which qualities would be evident were it not for the performances: Hopkins as the staid, shy family man Frank P Doel, and the marvellous Bancroft, relishing the vagaries of English pronunciation, as the headstrong Ms Hanff. Thankfully, the film has nothing to do with easy nostalgia; it's about real, credible people, and as such finally becomes very moving.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A classy Hispanic horror pic written and directed by the Mexican cinephile who made Cronos and Mimic. Like many Spanish movies about the Civil War, it filters that traumatic conflict through the partly comprehending eyes of a child. After his Republican father dies in battle, 10-year-old Carlos (Tielve) is left in a desert orphanage, where crippled widow Carmen (Paredes) and kindly Professor Casares (Luppi) hope to protect their charges from advancing Fascists. But danger exists inside the fragile sanctuary, too - not only does Carlos clash with older bully Jaime, but there's surly, self-serving janitor Jacinto (Noriega) to worry about, not to mention chilling rumours about a kid who went missing. If only for its technical aspects, this would rate as a pleasurably superior supernatural psychological thriller, with polished but subtle special effects, painterly, atmospheric cinematography and vivid performances from a top-notch cast. What lifts it, however, is an adept use of generic elements as a poetic/metaphorical gloss on political and historical realities. Hence a ghost mystery becomes a tale of opposing forces building to a deadly, explosive denouement in which concealed passions finally burst forth.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The war that transformed Rhodesia into Zimbabwe is shown through the experiences of two young women freedom fighters, one dedicated to improvement through study, the other a more robust type with a tendency to fall for the wrong man. An intelligent, sympathetic first feature, but a tad predictable and so rushed in places that it slides into less than persuasive melodrama. 'Flame' (Kunonga) finds she's pregnant, gives birth in a truck and loses the baby in an air raid, all in about five minutes.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its odd that programmers would choose Fred Zinnemans lip-smacking ensemble melodrama from 1953 as the centrepiece of a BFI retrospective of the work of actress Deborah Kerr  its a stretch to call her one of the films key players. Yes, she gets to canoodle in the Hawaiian surf with Burt Lancaster, but the film mostly focuses on the band of dysfunctional tyros at a nearby army base whose carefree, pre-Pearl Harbor lives are on the road to ruin long before the bombs drop. From Here to Eternity remains a garish but compelling ode to the lonely lot of the pacifist, and Montgomery Clift is outstanding as the blighted boxing-champ-cum-bugle-player who is constantly goaded by friends (Frank Sinatra), enemies (Ernest Borgnine) and lovers (Donna Reed) to unleash his ferocious alter-ego. The film is anonymously directed, functionally paced and hysterical at times, though it seduces as a hot-blooded spectacle that stitches emotional detail onto the epic canvas of history.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Teenager Marty McFly's dad is a hideous wimp, his mother a dipso, so he befriends mad scientist Dr. Brown (Lloyd). In a DeLorean time machine they travel back to 1955, the year his parents met in high school. But at that age, mom rather fancies her offspring more than his prospective father. Zemeckis takes obvious pleasure in solving not just the technical but also the emotional problems of time travel: how to avoid incest, how to unite your parents in order that you will be born, how to return to the future when both the car and the professor have blown a fuse, and above all how to avoid tampering with history. If this all sounds schematic, it shouldn't: the movie has all the benign good nature of a Frank Capra.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Murnau's final Hollywood film is widely underrated, no doubt because Fox cut it against his wishes and turned the original silent film into a poorly synchronised part-talkie. None the less, the director's visual talents remain evident in the soft lighting and the pastoral landscapes, and the film is of more than passing interest. As in the superior <i>Sunrise</i>, Murnau is concerned with the difference between urban and rural life: a wheat-farmer's son marries a waitress who longs to escape the city, but the old man, suspicious of her fidelity, rejects her, turning against his son. If the plot sounds vaguely familiar, that may be because Malick's <i>Days of Heaven</i> trod somewhat similar ground.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Luppi, an elderly antiques dealer, discovers a gold gizmo which a mysterious alchemist had hidden inside a statue centuries before. The old man becomes immortal, his body undergoes a bizarre transformation, and he develops a thirst for blood. Resisting the efforts of dying businessman Brook and his henchman Perlman to get hold of the so-called Cronos device (it has strange body-piercing abilities), Luppi struggles to hold on to his humanity even beyond the grave. Del Toro gives an intriguing spin to the time-honoured vampire pic. Out goes gratuitous blood letting, in comes dry wit, a sombre pace and a substantial emotional kick, as Luppi seeks to maintain the powerful bond with his wife and young granddaughter, even though he looks, well, like something from a horror movie. A most startling genre piece: tender, imaginative and wholly its own.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Maggie Smith has already won an Emmy for her performance in this pretty moderate cable movie. Shes in her usual commanding form as Emily Delahunty, prolific writer of romance novels, who offers her Umbrian mansion as a place of recuperation for the fellow survivors of a terrorist bomb-blast. Predictably, theyre a varied bunch, including a troubled young German (Benno Frmann), a crusty British general (Ronnie Barker, not bad in a rare dramatic role) and a little American girl (Emily Clarke), orphaned by the incident. Bonding with the child proves an enriching experience for the spinsterish but flamboyant grande dame, with dilemmas and regret to follow when a dull-stick academic uncle (Chris Cooper, constrained in a stuffy role) arrives to claim his niece. Elsewhere, the restorative power of gardening works its magic, and the film trundles along pleasantly enough. Smiths showboating is inevitably disarming, but this still looks like it belongs on the small screen. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Eckart Fingbergs animated toddlers adventure is structured in such elementary fashion that even the youngest child couldnt possibly fail to grasp its simple premise. Tackling notions of discovery, social responsibility and trust, it tracks the fearless antics of a teenage penguin and his younger sibling who board an ocean liner, help a green parrot save its eggs from thieves and then return to their Antarctic home to tell their ignorant parents that there is indeed life beyond the icebergs. The animation is as basic as it comes and the voice-overs are naff beyond belief. Thats not to say toddlers wont enjoy the ride. But I pity the parents.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[On-off couple Drew Barrymore and Justin Long bring plenty of spark to this irreverent romcom. Barrymores Erin is a would-be journo who meets Longs Garrett during an internship in New York. After she returns to Chicago, they decide to try a long-distance relationship. <br />Whats both refreshing and problematic is that theres no emotional imbalance between boy and girl: their feelings are mutual and the obstacle is purely geographical. Their chemistry and mischievous banter are fun, but the story offers little tension and eventually becomes repetitive. <br />Luckily, the characters have bags of charm: both work hard, play hard and give as good as they get. The night they meet, Garretts flatmate plays 80s love songs through the wall as a soundtrack to their hook-up. Erin feigns offence, but thinks its hilarious. <br />The scene is set for a fun-loving courtship with amusing sidekicks: Christina Applegate is good as Erins sister, while Jason Sudeikis is great as Dans brash mate. It may tire before the finish line, but Going the Distance is still good for a giggle.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A fresh-faced toddler and his bashful, semi-estranged father trade hushed life lessons in this gorgeous docu-fiction from Mexican director Pedro Gonzlez-Rubio. Filmed with a skeleton crew (Rubio as cinematographer alongside a single sound man) in the rickety, stilted shacks surrounding the atoll reef of Quintana Roo off the south-east coast of Mexico, this rugged, tranquil film chronicles a rite-of-passage fishing trip the pair takes before the boy is whisked off to Italy with his mother. <br />At first their bond is tacit and undemonstrative, but through various father-son activities  house-painting, cooking, descaling fish  you gradually get a sense of the profound mutual affection they share. Rubio frames the central drama against a sublime natural backdrop, capturing a mesmerising elemental harmony between man and beast. Moving but never sentimental, ambient but rigorously focused, this is an assured, refreshingly simple film where the dramas and responsibilities of parenthood exist inside a bubble of blissed-out tropicalia.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Laughton's only stab at directing, with Mitchum as the psychopathic preacher with 'love' and 'hate' tattooed on his knuckles, turned out to be a genuine weirdie. Set in '30s rural America, the film polarises into a struggle between good and evil for the souls of innocent children. Everyone's contribution is equally important. Laughton's deliberately old-fashioned direction throws up a startling array of images: an amalgam of Mark Twain-like exteriors (idyllic riverside life) and expressionist interiors, full of moody nighttime shadows. The style reaches its pitch in the extraordinary moonlight flight of the two children downriver, gliding silently in the distance, watched over by animals seen in huge close-up, filling up the foreground of the screen. James Agee's script (faithfully translating Davis Grubb's novel) treads a tight path between humour (it's a surprisingly light film in many ways) and straight suspense, a combination best realised when Gish sits the night out on the porch waiting for Mitchum to attack, and they both sing 'Leaning on the Everlasting Arms' to themselves. Finally, there's the absolute authority of Mitchum's performance - easy, charming, infinitely sinister.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A modern <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, with Malcolm McDowell (reprising the name, if not the character, of the hero of <i>If...</i>) as the young man in search of fame and the better things of life, <i>O Lucky Man!</i> is a disappointment. Lacking the specificity of either <i>If...</i> or <i>This Sporting Life</i>, it's an undisciplined (at nearly three hours long) humanist shriek of anger at what 'They' are doing to 'Us', lashing out wildly without purpose. The result is a film that approaches its material not in the manner of a Swift or an Orwell, but as the <i>Carry On </i>team might under the temporary influence of surrealism. In short, all puff and no thought. None the less interesting, with Alan Price's songs punctuating and informing the film's episodic action.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[August 1956: the ailing Bertolt Brecht is with his wife, staff and various guests at his lakeside villa, alternating his time writing, chasing after new lovers, avoiding old lovers, and generally feeling rotten, curmudgeonly and tyrannical; meanwhile, unbeknown to him, the authorities want a couple of his guests for 'treason'. This is nothing if not earnest and arty: taciturn, elegiac, measured, oblique, allusive, elegant. It's also, unfortunately, a touch dull and somewhat insubstantial. The themes - compromise, creativity, self-awareness and deception, power, loyalty and betrayal - are all present and correct, but aren't developed in any particularly interesting way.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA['We don't need no education' - cue inevitable shots of blank-faced schoolkids on a conveyor-belt to the dead-end mincer. It's hard to see where the much-rumoured creative clashes between Floydian self-analyst Roger Waters and director Parker arose, since the movie is a matter of such stunning literalism: it's little more than kinetic sleeve art keyed slavishly to a slim concept-album narrative. Neither Parker's bombastic live action sequences (carrying Geldof's mute Pink from a war-baby context of military carnage towards neo-fascist rallying, via the turbulence of rock stardom) nor Gerald Scarfe's animation offer more than pictorial italicising of Waters' lyrics; and the autobiographical pain is laid on so thick it emerges looking more like misogynist petulance. Crossing <i>Privilege</i> with <i>Tommy</i> couldn't result in anything shallower. All in all, it's just another flick to appal.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A fairytale as told to a bedridden boy: the willowy Buttercup (Wright), destined as consort to the wicked Prince Humperdinck (Sarandon), is abducted and whisked through a series of life-threatening exploits and miscast comic cameos. The story, adapted from William Goldman's book, is partly a traditional fantasy, with a damsel in distress, dashing lover, evil villains, and lotsa monsters and swordfights, but also a knowing commentary on the conventions of all such tales. The tone falls disconcertingly between straight action adventure and anachronistic Jewish spoof; the leads are vacuous; the absurdities sometimes forced and obvious. Only Guest's sadistic Count Rugen and Patinkin's vengeful Spanish swordsman inject any real enthusiasm into the proceedings; but the film does exude a certain innocent, unassertive charm, and kids will probably love it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[US critic Andrew Sarris once noted that arch cinematic stylist Vincente Minnelli used his camera to turn corn into caviar, and this swooning, nostalgic, and luridly coloured encapsulation of the stale underbelly of small-town Middle America and its effect on the nervously vacillating social attitudes of a struggling artist does all that and more. <br />Based on the novel by WWII veteran James Jones, the film sees malcontent army officer Dave Hirsch (Frank Sinatra) returning to his sickeningly quaint hometown in a bid to reconcile a latent desire to be accepted as a serious novelist with his family and the local literati. This is despite some of his more unsociable quirks, most notably an unhelpful camaraderie with hat-wearing card sharp, Bama (Dean Martin) and unshakably sanguine drifter, Ginny (Shirley MacLaine). <br />Its a bitter and occasionally conceited film, but Minnellis fluent, intense direction makes it a marvel to behold, especially the shocking fairground denouement which displays all the technical virtuosity (and none of the pretension) of the ballets featured at the tail-end of An American in Paris or The Band Wagon. Wonderful stuff.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For the first 20 minutes or so this slice of Nordic surrealism - a blend of millennial metaphorical allegory and bizarre black comedy - looks set to become some sort of hilarious masterpiece, before the novelty begins to wear off and the lack of a strong narrative thread takes its toll. That said, its very loosely connected vignettes - largely centred on elderly office, workers and their families coping with redundancy, inept magicians, bad hospitals and unending traffic jams - are visually striking, frequently fertile in their dark, deadpan inventiveness, and now and then truly evocative of apocalyptic insanity. A genuinely fascinating oddity, though its echoes of late Buuel and Aki Kaurismki provoke comparisons from which Andersson's film inevitably suffers.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Billington once described this political satire as a kind of British <i>Z</i>, but after the subtlety of his first feature, <i>Interlude</i>, it seemed blunt and a bit pointless. Written and performed by a host of satirical talent, it chronicles the rise of a self-appointed business efficiency expert (Cook), who becomes an autocratic dictator by submitting every issue to national referendum. Somehow the jokes fall a bit thin, and the script can't make up its mind whether to go out for narrative or a string of weak sketches. Despite Cleese's script credit (along with Cook, Chapman and Billington), the writing is miles below <i>Monty Python </i>standard.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[James Cameron's follow-up to <i>Aliens</i> abandons deep space for the spacey deep, and hits rock bottom as the submarine genre meets <i>Close Encounters</i>. A nuclear sub crashes on the floor of the Atlantic, and the motley crew of an underwater station attached to an oil rig investigate. Inevitably problems mount: a hurricane rages above, a loony marine is on the loose, and cap'n Ed Harris is forced to work with his estranged wife (Mastrantonio), who we're continually told is an utter bitch but who is actually characterised as a perfectly reasonable, efficient engineer. Moreover, there's something out there - though from the first glimpse of flashing lights cruising the deep, anyone who knows their Spielberg will guess the presence is benign. After a relatively gripping start, Cameron's <i>folie de grandeur</i> rapidly sinks into clich, absurdity and hyperbole; a collapsing crane contributes one pleasingly extended chain of disasters, but the rest of this overlong concoction is scuppered by dire dialogue, histrionic performances and maudlin sentimentality.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The second feature from the maker of the exquisite <i>Maborosi</i> returns to the theme of the relationship between life and death, but reverses the perspective. It is set in a limbo that looks like a slightly shabby school, where counsellors help new arrivals choose their most precious memory which is then recreated on a film to accompany them to eternity. The movie is about how we look back and make sense of our lives. With a strong documentary feel (many of the cast are non-professionals evidently drawing on personal experience), the film succeeds partly as an amusing and richly affecting portrait of what constitutes happiness for a wide range of modern Japanese; it is also, in passing, a little tribute to the way cinema connects with our dreams. Most poignantly, however, as it charts a revelatory encounter between a counsellor and one of his charges, it offers a subtle tribute to the healing power of love.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Effects apart, this is dire: predictable, clichd, sloppily written, pitifully performed and surprisingly short of real shocks and suspense. The story can be described in two ways: as a rip-off of <i>Only Angels Have Wings</i>, in which Paxton's implausibly intuitive tornado expert is torn between two women, his ex (Hunt) and his fiance (Gertz), and two lives, a safe weatherman job, or a risky return to the group of crazily devoted storm-chasers trying to get a gizmo up inside a twister's 'suck-zone'; or as a repetitive spectacle where all that happens is that the objects hurled around in the air simply get bigger. Forget the many redundant references to <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, this hasn't a fraction of that movie's logic, imagination or ambitions. Seriously depressing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The excitement following last years announcement that the movie worlds two most notable mavericks, Werner Herzog and David Lynch, would be working together for the first time was swiftly tempered by reports that Lynch was on board only as executive producer and would have no direct hand in the writing or filmmaking process. Well, something clearly got mixed up somewhere because its hard to imagine an actual collaboration feeling more overtly Lynchian than My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done?, a brooding, absurdist psychodrama that feels a lot like a prospective episode of Lynchs unmade Mulholland Drive TV show, albeit weighed down with wholly Herzogian psychological and spiritual preoccupations. <br />Michael Shannon is terse and compelling as Brad McCullum, whose snap decision to murder his domineering mother with a samurai sword kickstarts a two-strand plot, one following hardbitten cop Willem Dafoes increasingly public attempts to draw Brad out of his hiding place in the family home, the other flashing back, through the memories of girlfriend Chlo Sevigny and drama teacher Udo Kier, to track Brads descent into madness. <br />Herzog has described My Son, My Son as a horror movie but that doesnt go nearly far enough: its also a hostage drama, a psychological study, a sly pastiche and a grim but often very funny black comedy. Its rare to see a film where a directors true intentions are so effectively masked: for the most part, the picture is played disarmingly straight but, <br />as is often the case in Herzogs and especially Lynchs work, the sheer strangeness on show often threatens to tip things over into black comedy.<br />The most appropriate comparison might be with Kubricks The Shining, another film which remains brilliantly unsettling while still managing to have a bit of fun with the horror genre. But some of the same flaws apply here, too: both films can feel like cynical exercises in audience manipulation rather than genuine works of art and both sometimes feel forced in their commitment to audience-baiting weirdness. In both films, too, the main character seems completely berserk when we first meet him, so any attempts at exploring the psychology of insanity feel somewhat unsatisfying. <br />My Son, My Son may be a minor work in the Herzog canon but its still one of the more fascinating, frustrating, disturbing and beautiful experiences available to cinemagoers this year.]]></review>

Two rings hold the key to its location: one has been found by a pupil, the other is missing. Both are desired by the dastardly Lord Pomfrey (David Tennant). And so the girls must square up to Pomfrey, infiltrate a secret society and run riot around Londons landmarks in short skirts and over-the-knee socks.<br />But all this plot stuff is pretty irrelevant in a St Trinians movie: its about escapism for young girls, and in the tradition of teen movies, theres an idol for each tribe: Emos, Rude Girls, Posh Totties, Geeks and Ecos (the Noughties answer to Crusties). Lazy pop culture references abound, including several out-dated Amy Winehouse gags. Theres also a token schoolgirl role for 28-year-old Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding, who rocks up looking like the babysitter. Every time she chimes in an octave lower, you think shes going to get rumbled. Alongside painful stereotypes are the usual exceptions: Rupert Everett as kindly, eccentric headmistress Camilla Fritton and Colin Firth as her former lover Geoffrey. Everett is a particular delight, adding nuance to broad one-liners and sympathetic touches to his character. In short, its business as usual at St Trinians.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Are you one of those people who stop a conversation midsentence to
coo awww, a baby when a stroller passes by with a cute infant in tow?
If so, run, dont walk, to this documentary. If not, you might be bored
stiff. That being said, this film, which follows four infantsin
Mongolia, San Francisco, Namibia and Tokyofrom first breath to first
steps, is so darn adorable it has a lulling effect that will mellow
even the most vehement baby haters. </p><p>The movie is the brainchild
of Alain Chabat, but its French director Thomas Balmes who soars,
manipulating his footage in such a way that both the universal and the
culturally specific elements of these babies upbringings are keenly
felt. Though youll feel a range of emotionshock when the camera zooms
in on a live birth scene, laughter when one infant tries to escape a
hippie, eco-baby class, pounding on the doors to get outsadness is not
in this documentarys vocabulary. All the babies plod along to the
soundtrack of Sufjan Stevenss The Perpetual Self, all giggles,
adorableness and discovery. Its infectious; youll walk out of the
theater feeling happy to be human, wishing you could go out and buy a
baby, or at least borrow one for a little while. Then youll look at
your watch and not believe you spent the past 79 minutes watching
babies crawl aroundand didnt mind at all.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Bollywood superstar-producer Aamir Khans latest addresses Indian farmers who commit suicide. Unable to cope with urbanisation and debt, at least 200,000 men have died in the last decade. The governments response: compensation for the family. When Natha (Omkar Das Manikpuri), a farmer from fictitious Peepli, realises he will lose his land over an unpaid loan, he hatches a plan to ease his familys debt. He must die. With elections imminent and the press omnipresent, events get out of control.Slumdog Millionaire introduced audiences to the underbelly of Indias maximum city; Peepli delves further into the real India. Its realism, so rare in Bollywood, delivers a sobering message about the urban and rural divide and an indifferent administration. First-time female director Anusha Rizvis witty script adopts a Capraesque approach to this grim topic. A largely unknown confident cast, rousing folk music and Rizvis understated direction result in a fresh, credible comic gem. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Outside the futuristic Empire State nightclub in London's docklands, yuppie housing developments and fly-by-night warehousing projects are rapidly replacing the old working class communities. Wide boy Paul (Sears) tries to set up a deal with American businessman Chuck (Landau), but his plans to cut former boss Frank (McAnally) out of the game seriously underestimate the strength of old East End money. The fates of a chorus of minor characters criss-cross one another before finally converging on the club, where the rivalry between Paul and Frank explodes into primitive bare knuckles pugilism. For all its stylised images and electro muzak, the film's two-dimensional characters are simply static figures in what wants to be a hard-edged Hollywood-style thriller, but is in fact a cold hi-tech design. A brave but flawed attempt to escape the straitjacket of British realism.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[There was talk of Joaquin Phoenix going off the rails  behaving oddly in interviews, checking into rehab  long before news broke that this intimate doc by his brother-in-law, Casey Affleck, charting a whacked-out, hairy and fat Phoenixs withdrawal from acting during 2008 and subsequent laughable attempt to become a rapper, might be a hoax.<br />Whats clear from watching the film, which is presented as an up-close, fly-on-the-wall doc, following Phoenix at home in New York and Los Angeles, is that while its motivations might have been genuine, its execution is wobbly: some scenes, especially those involving Phoenixs antagonistic relationships with his assistants, feel staged, and encounters with the likes of Ben Stiller (offering him a part in Greenberg) and P Diddy (suffering his ambition to make a record) dont feel very real at all. Which means that you spend a lot of time trying to unpick the question of fakery and less time thinking about the issue in hand, which, we imagine, is Phoenixs desire to say something about fame and his role in that game.<br />The hoax issue is a bit of red herring: Phoenix is known for being unable to separate acting and life, and with that in mind Im Still Here is best viewed as a fictional self-portrait. He is giving us a version of himself, real or not, and Affleck is merely a collaborator. The problem is that the portrait that emerges is of a vain man-child, ill at ease with the world and his place in it. It might be honest, but its not pretty. As playful reflections on your own persona go, Banksys Exit Through the Gift Shop trumps this effort by a long way, but its mostly a compelling, teasing watch.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[With <i>L'Avventura</i> and <i>La Notte</i>, <i>L'Eclisse</i> completes an Antonioni trilogy on doomed relationships in a fractured world. This time, Vitti has a traumatic bust-up with the bookish Rabal, and apathetically lets herself get involved with brash young stockbroker Delon. At first glance it's a more formally innovative movie than its predecessors (witness the ending: a long montage that doesn't show the principal characters), but it's underpinned by the same hackneyed symbolism: dawn and nightfall, construction sites, the Bomb, 'ethnic' spontaneity and the rest. Anyone disenchanted with the vacuity of later Antonioni will find the seeds of their dissatisfaction well-rooted in the mannerism and facile anguish evident here.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Abuladze's film is a magically sustained fantasia about life in a Georgian village on the eve of the revolution, poetry rather than narrative thrust carrying it from one incident to another. The characters are eccentric, and their dreams and longings are gently indulged, from the simpleton who searches for the tree that will fulfil his wishes, to the dishevelled lady fortune-teller who promises herself the return of a long-lost lover. The central focus is a tragic love story (sweethearts denied marriage by the village elders), and this, more than any overtly political points, serves to intimate the social changes to come. Best seen in the original Georgian version (rather than the Russian-dubbed one), with its delicate aural lyricism matching the pictorial splendours.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Dreyer's penultimate feature (<i>Gertrud</i> followed a full decade later) is another of his explorations of the clash between orthodox religion and true faith. Based with great fidelity on a play by Kaj Munk, it's formulated as a kind of rural chamber drama, and like most of Dreyer's films it centres on the tensions within a family. Its method is to establish a scrupulously realistic frame of reference, then undercut it thematically with elements of the fantastic and formally with a film syntax that demands constant attention to the way meaning is being constructed. The intensity of the viewer's relationship with the film makes the closing scene (a miracle) one of the most extraordinary in all cinema.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Anti-Nazi propaganda film from Warners, with Robinson (like Cagney, doing an about-face from gangster roles to more respectable characters) as the G-Man ferreting out Nazi fifth columnists working in America. Topically following hard on the heels of several anti-Nazi trials in 1938, the film achieved great popular and critical success in America (though banned in many Latin American and European countries); now, for all its admirable anti-Fascist relevance, it seems weakened by its patriotic flag-waving and the pseudo-documentary approach (sacrificing suspense) taken by Litvak. But the quietly determined Robinson, the sinister Sanders (as a Nazi villain, a role he would later develop in Lang's <i>Man Hunt</i>), and Lederer (the man duped into becoming a spy by his vain egocentricity) lend a power to the film that makes it still worth watching.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its hard to say quite how much one of the great, late masterpieces of the silent era, GW Pabsts extraordinary, erotic and tragic adaptation/conflation of two Wedekind plays, Pandoras Box, owes to the electrifying, photogenic and iconic presence of Louise Brooks, the Kansas-born actress who is subject to a month-long season at the NFT this month. Its an Expressionist-Realist walk with love and death, as the sensual and erotic charge of a Berlin prostitute and Kurfrstendamm revue artist sets herself and all who come in contact with her into a destructive social, emotional and physical spiral, ending with her swooning embrace of Thanatos in the person of a mythical, murderous Jack the Ripper. But it may not have seemed quite so modern, vital and powerful, had Pabst chosen, say, Dietrich, or any of the rumoured 2,000 others who the German director screen-tested for the role of the arch femme-fatale, Lulu. <br />In the words of German critic Lotte Eisner, Wedekinds Lulu was endowed with an animal beauty, but lacking all moral sense, and doing evil unconsciously. Brooks had the animal beauty alright  and a modicum of self-destructiveness, as her biographical writings testify  but it is her qualities of intelligence and sheer vitality as Lulu, not her putative reflective passivity, that ensures that her performance seems as exciting and fresh, as well as disturbingly enigmatic, transgressive and deeply moving, today as it did in 1928. That does not diminish, however, the importance of Pabsts artistry: his psychological insights, atmospheric use of chiaroscuro lighting and thrilling mise-en-scne, not to mention his taboo-breaking audacity in flaunting this corn-fed Hollywood flapper and exposing the dark appetites and hypocrisies found in the dank, pansexually decadent salons of Weimar Berlin. All offer a perfect context in which Lulu can dazzle and entice, if not  to borrow the line Nic Ray coined in 1949s Knock on Any Door  to live fast, die young and leave a good-looking corpse. <br />If this early epitome of essentially challenging youthful rebellion refuses to, as it were, lie down, it must be said, few of her other performances in this ten-film season can fully match it. Pabst first spotted Brooks iconic blue-black Dutch bob in Howard Hawks enjoyable early buddy movie A Girl in Every Port, in which Brookss cloche-hatted beauty is disappointingly sidelined. Shes cross-dressed and engaging in William Wellmans adventurous Beggars of Life and androgynous in Pabsts excellent social-melodrama Diary of a Lost Girl. The season also includes a new print of the last movie in her all-too-short 13-year career, Overland Stage Raiders, a B-Western made in 1938, with Brooks starring against a young John Wayne.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A slow and sensitive portrait of the great Georgian primitive artist who died in 1918 and whose work is still not widely known outside Russia, <i>Pirosmani</i> effectively keeps its distance from the central character. Proud and lonely, Pirosmani forsakes all security to paint, exchanging his work in city bars for food, drink and a bed. His isolation is conveyed through composition and image, while his private life (alcoholism and an inability to make contact with a singer he silently worships) is hinted rather than stressed. A restrained film, possibly too non-involving for some, beautifully shot in muted colours, and composed of studies with the subjects often looking posed and self-conscious, as the artist must have seen them. It's not often that an artist gets the film he deserves.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The notoriously schmaltzy but still undeniably eye-catching film in which Aime and Trintignant conduct an intense and often unhappy affair against an elegant, colourful background. Lelouch tricks it out with every elaborate cinematic effect he can beg, borrow or steal, ransacking both Welles and Godard for titillating devices which look good but never even begin to mesh with the subject matter (note in particular the 360 degree tracking shot at the end). In some ways the film's sheer zest and the talented cast might have won the day, were it not for Francis Lai's dreadfully corny and monotonous theme music.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Huston first mooted his Kipling adaptation in the '40s (for Gable and Bogart), but the wait proved more than worthwhile, with the imperialist parody of two conmen's rise to Kafiristan kingship gaining in resonance from its director's maturity. Connery and Caine (both excellent) become classic Huston overreachers, and echoes of <i>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</i> and <i>Moby Dick</i> permeate the mythic yarn. Almost too lively to be dubbed a meditation on power.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Or, you, the living dead. The motley bunch of sad-looking characters that inhabit this series of vaguely-connected episodes of modern Stockholm life that sit somewhere between Kaurismki, Buuel and the Far Side cartoons all look as if they died days ago: their skins are white and drooping and their eyes look dead in their sockets. Thats life, though, Swedish director Roy Andersson seems to be saying in this most maudlin of feature-length comedy sketch shows which recalls the gallows humour of his Songs from the Second Floor (2000).<br />To call it deadpan is barely to hint at Anderssons style, which he mostly applies to the world of commercials (watch them on YouTube, theyre hilarious). But just when you think the only answer to Anderssons view of the world  alcoholic couples; depressed psychiatrists; a girl searching for a disappeared rock star who shows her a modicum of affection  is to throw yourself under one of Stockholms trams, he unleashes a set-piece that has you marvelling at its choreography or wondering at the sheer ridiculousness of life. <br />Highlights include a man who recalls a dream he had the previous night that saw him sentenced to death for the most silly of crimes and a vast university dinner that Andersson sets up purely so an elderly professor can be called out to answer a phone-call. New Orleans jazz graces the soundtrack courtesy of the miserable characters that play the drums and the tuba; their celebratory tunes conflict wildly with their melancholy lives. Emotionally, the films saving grace is that the good guys  a lovelorn girl, a barber taking racist abuse from a customer  get their own back, and at least some of the bad guys  a braying businessman, the racist  get their come-uppance. You wont know whether to laugh or cry.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The most effective of this years Blair Witch-style shaky-cam horror movies, [Rec] is more focused and far scarier than either Cloverfield or Diary of the Dead. In Cloverfield, the party-goers braved the streets and subways of a monster-torn Manhattan; in Diary, the film students roamed the back roads of Pennsylvania, avoiding a zombie plague. In [Rec]  as in the record button on a camera  the action is confined to a Spanish apartment block, and the nature of the threat is unknown.<br /><br />[Rec] softens us up with a gentle prologue in which the crew of a late-night reality TV show called While Youre Sleeping  invisible cameraman Pablo and presenter Angela (Manuela Velasco)  make a late-night visit to a fire station. Then comes a call about an old woman trapped in her apartment. When a policeman and two firemen, Manu (Ferran Terraza) and Alex (David Vert), break into the apartment, they are attacked by a shrieking, zombie-like woman in a blood-stained nightdress. Suddenly, the building is locked down by cops squawking something about a health threat. Trapped inside with the panicking neighbours, Angela keeps up a running commentary.<br /><br />The less you know about what happens next the better. Suffice it to say that nothing in the previous work of joint directors Jaume Balaguer and Paco Plaza prepared us for the nerve-shredding intensity of the ensuing scenes. A brilliantly staged early scare signals that the safety rails are off and, despite an unexpected, last-minute swerve into the supernatural realm, the edge-of-the-seat tension is sustained to the very last second. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[As well-intentioned as it is deathly dull, this moody, London-set indie attempts to fuse a sprawling, right-on social agenda with a tenderly wrought mismatched romance and doesnt manage to say anything interesting about either. Sheamy (Scot Williams  OTT) is a disgraced priest who comes down to London to hook up with his old superior, Father Brendan. When he is unable to track him down, his only other contact is folk singer Rory whom he meets in a bar along with charming concert promoter Katie (Cara Seymour). Katie and Sheamy develop a mutual crush but soon discover they are each concealing dark secrets that must be overcome before things go any further. Despite committed turns from the two leads (especially Seymour, who brings an edge of mystery to what is a naggingly superficial character), the tepid script and agile but inconsistent direction fail them at every turn.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Youve watched these scenes before, awful in their heartbreak, most memorably in <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>: Steven Spielberg frames an army mother in silhouette as uniformed men approach her doorway, solemnly removing their caps. She sinks to her knees, the news too hard to bear. </p><p><i>The Messenger</i> focuses specifically and tenderly on these moments, and on the stern but damaged men who perform such duties on a daily basis. The reactions dont go as smoothly as with Mrs. Ryan. A bitter father cant believe his daughter has married that greaseball until they both hear the KIA report, and he can only hold her while she screams. Wives fall ruined; a gardening dad (Steve Buscemi, in a powerful cameo) can only spit his rage: Why arent you dead?</p><p>And maybe they are a little dead. Notification trainee Will (Foster) served heroically in Iraq but seems to have left a bit of his soul behind. His new boss, an imposing mountain of a man, Captain Stone (Harrelson, at his finest), hides his own loneliness behind the procedures of proper respect and a script they have to read. Directed by a newcomer, Oren Moverman (the cowriter of Todd Hayness Bob Dylan fantasia, <i>Im Not There</i>), the movie does an uncommonly sensitive job probing the psychologies of blocked men, less so the urges of a widow who needs more than comforting words. (As played by the great Samantha Morton, youll forgive this obvious plot trajectory.) Though it feels a little too indie-ish in its wallowing misery, <i>The Messenger </i>signals the start of strong year-end work.<br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A documentary by the San Francisco-based Mariposa Film Group, comprising interviews with 26 gay American men and women of varied classes and ethnic origins. It is neither militant (although it does contain some footage of civil rights demos) nor analytic (although the careful selection of interviewees bespeaks one level of analysis), and is an important film for those very reasons. It doesn't intimidate or alienate any potential viewer, but uses techniques of simple reasoning, and elements of mild surprise, to catch attention and hold it. If two hours of talking heads sounds like a long time, then it's a measure of the film-makers' success that the result is as gripping and persuasive as the most accomplished fiction.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The most startling thing about Boudu  which is being furnished with an extended run as part of a complete retrospective of the work of, for me, the finest director of them all  is just how incredibly fresh it remains. Its hard to believe that sound cinema was a mere five years old when, in 1932, Renoir and his collaborator, actor and producer Michel Simon brought their tale of the disruptions wreaked by a priapic Parisian tramp to fruition. The films extraordinary vif and spontaneity is partly explained by Renoirs liberating approach to acting, his leisurely takes and formal experimentation (notably with sound), and partly by his use of real location  you really feel you could step right on to these bustling boulevards. Simons Boudu  whos fished out of the river following a suicide attempt by a later rueful philanthropist and given the ultimate Trinny &amp; Susannah makeover  is a comic masterpiece and stands alongside his Pre Jules in LAtalante as a contender for his greatest screen role. Everybody has their reasons, but Boudus are finally hard to divine. His libidinous anarchy may provide the director with his funniest comedy but Renoir never pretends to unravel his sometimes surreal but often dark, troubling and challenging enigma. Great stuff.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Reckless Gunnar adventures forth to make his fortune only to be concussed by stampeding reindeer. He returns home zombiefied but is finally restored to health and wealth by the love of a beautiful fiddle player from a travelling show. One way of approaching this odd but rewarding movie, from Selma Lagerlf's novel, is to imagine a prologue in which a child announces 'Once upon a time...' The tale which follows, with its sinister/comforting mother and vigorous/passive hero, would play quite smoothly if the copious inter-titles were rendered in Daisy Ashford-ese. Freudians will find the film specially congenial, particularly the heroine's dream, in which Gunnar is carried into her bedroom on a sledge driven by an old woman and pulled by four enormous black bears.

      <review><![CDATA[An enormously tedious and overblown adaptation of William Inge's successful play about a drifter (Holden) who arrives in a Kansas town, a brawny sexual presence who changes some of the people's lives. It is typical of the kind of histrionic, slightly daring, small-town stories which always got rave reviews in the '50s on account of their 'dramatic authenticity'. There are admittedly some reasonable performances (Holden, Robertson and Strasberg, in particular), but Kim Novak in a crucial central role is completely flat.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Cloud nine tosh from the days when Warner movies preached that delinquents were just good kids in need of a helping hand. Cagney plays a ward-heeler rewarded with a political sinecure as Deputy Commissioner of a reform school. Up from the slums himself, horrified by the sadistic brutality of the director (Digges), Cagney takes over. Improving the food, relaxing the discipline, and replacing the warders with a system of self-government, he soon has the boys eating out of his hand. But unrest back in the ward ends with Cagney shooting the trouble-maker (Huber) in self-defence; and while he's in hiding, Digges restores his old regime. Jeopardising his freedom, Cagney rushes back in time to end a riot by the boys (a tubercular kid died after being locked in an unheated cell), though not before Digges falls to his death. The good angel Happy Ending tidies away all awkward questions, and Cagney is asked to stay on as director. Despite the risible script, Cagney is as watchable as ever, and Mayo directs sleekly. Remade as vehicles for the Dead End Kids: <i>Crime School</i> (1938) and <i>Hell's Kitchen</i> (1939).]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Images leap non-stop out of this wonderful Irish animation, which picked up a surprise Oscar nomination this year. It imagines the making of Irelands national treasure, The Book of Kells  a medieval manuscript illustrating the four Gospels. If that sounds monastic and staid, the film is anything but. It mines Celtic folklore and fairy tale as much as history and begins with a goose-chase, literally. Twelve-year-old Brandon dashes after the querulous bird to pluck a few feathers for quills. His uncle, the abbot (voiced by Brendan Gleeson), is building a wall around the monastery as sanctuary from the Vikings, but Brandon would rather be in the scriptorium where a jolly gang of monks are illustrating scripts.<br />The mostly hand-drawn animation takes its cues from medieval art: gloriously ornate and antique, with spiralling curlicues, Celtic symbols  and all very flat. The Vikings are terrifying, not men at all but abstract, headstone-like demons. Fleeing these north men, master illuminator Brother Aidan arrives at the monastery, carrying the book. Flowing white hair, long robes, a glint in the eye: Aidan has the patter of a saintly bookie. Like all grown-ups he has huge hands and fingers, and there is a lovely message about craft and discovering the wonder of art and nature.<br />Aidan takes Brendan under his wing, sending him into a forest where he meets Aisling, a fairy-like wolf girl. Carpeted with bluebells, the forest is a joy, full of fat little birds and teeming with butterflies and owls. The animators show the change of seasons: blackened snow in winter, russet leaves fluttering in autumn. That must have added a huge burden to already painstaking work, and shows what a labour of love this film surely was for director Tomm Moore. The story is a bit tangled, and there is too much of it packed into nearly 80 minutes, but little kids wont be bothered when the animation is so magical. Older ones may get restless.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[I dont deal in conspiracy theory, growls Michael Ruppert, the former LA lawman, CIA whistleblower and investigative journalist at the centre of this documentary. I deal in conspiracy fact. Its been over a decade since Chris Smiths American Movie introduced audiences to backwoods film fanatic Mark Borchardt, but the directors fondness for articulate, quixotic, self-mythologising obsessives clearly hasnt waned. Rupperts bugbear is peak oil, the idea that the worlds fossil fuel resources are beginning to decline, and that with them goes all of human civilisation. The film is basically one long interview, filmed interrogation-style in a darkened basement as Ruppert chainsmokes and wisecracks his way through the nightmare scenario he envisions for our species: mass starvation, social breakdown, the energy apocalypse. Smiths attitude towards his subject is appealingly ambiguous: is Ruppert a righteous prophet of doom or just a paranoid sociopath with a grudge against the US elite? Were never quite sure  but that doesnt prevent many of his direst warnings from ringing blood-chillingly true.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival</i><br />Thai filmmaker and artist Apichatpong Weerasethakul (you can call him Joe) has enjoyed a spectacular rise to international stardom as a world-class auteur in the last decade. Blissfully Yours, Tropical Malady and Syndromes and a Century have met with a rapturous welcome from critics around the world. So enormous hopes have been pinned on this latest feature.<br />Certainly the film  about a man dying from kidney failure and a couple of his relatives being visited in rural north-eastern Thailand by the ghosts of humans and animals  again confirms him as one of the most distinctive filmmakers at work today. <br />Many sequences have a brooding lyrical beauty, the films rhythms are at once elastic and mesmerising, and the narrative features disconcerting shifts that may mystify viewers unfamiliar with his earlier work. But at the same time one does perhaps wonder why so many admirers of Joes work are quite so unbridled in their enthusiasm. I myself see no reason to be any more indulgent towards a Buddhist belief in reincarnation than I am towards similar Western superstitions, so my interest in monkey ghosts and talking catfish is constrained by my feelings that such characters are simply implausible, especially when the former  black hairy things with gleaming red eyes  look as if theyve strayed in from a Star Wars picture.<br />My failing, perhaps, and also, some will surely say, my loss; but I do occasionally feel so culturally remote from some of Joes concerns that its hard for me to engage fully on an emotional level with his films; intellectually Im not much the wiser, either. Still, there are highly atmospheric moments in Uncle Boonmee  the twilight prologue with a buffalo, a waterfall sequence, a walk through caves at night  and many, Im sure, will be seduced by its visual and aural delights.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Part documentary, part drama, this exceptional experimental film by artist and lecturer Clio Barnard explores the life and legacy of Andrea Dunbar while also revealing the difficulties of such a project. Dunbar was the troubled playwright from a rundown Bradford estate whose first play, 'The Arbor', was staged in 1980 when she was 18 and who went on to write Rita, Sue and Bob Too and died at 29. Barnards highly original techniques stress the fluid nature of reconstruction and recollection. We hear her interviewees  mostly Dunbars family and her tragic daughter Lorraine who is the films main focus  but we dont see them: theyre played by actors who synchronise their performances to Dunbars recordings. Stimulating and very moving.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Feeling like it was purpose-built for affluent, middle-aged couples thinking about engaging in some consenting extra-marital nookie, this well made but ineffectual ensemble drama examines relationships with a capital âRâ and feels like it should be viewed with a new-age self help manual and a tub of hummus close by. Rachel (Marina FoÃ¯s) and Franck (Roschdy Zem) are happily married. So are Vincent (Nicolas Duvauchelle) and Teri (Elodie Bouchez). Yet a wandering hand at a dinner party leads them to ponder whether theyâve got it in them to exchange partners for purely sexual ends, quickly culminating in a inhibition-busting four-way fantasy that involves a large sack of flour. But inevitably, their hedonism turns sour and the filmâs initially risky suggestion that sex and love can and should be practiced separately fritters away.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Sayless typically intelligent, thought-provoking film about the Philippine-American War  which took place at the start of the twentieth century, as the US was liberating various territories from Spanish colonialism  charts the relationships, in a village designed to become a garrison, between American troops, locals (be they peasant farmers or guerrila fighters) and a Spanish priest serving, none too reliably, as translator. As ever, the writer-director has done his research properly and profitably, and despite working in several languages with a large cast, paints a picture of conflict thats not only convincing in its complexity but relevant to more recent attempts to impose democracy. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[From dust to dust Frammartinos second feature echoes the likewise wonderful Il Dono in being set in an impoverished Calabrian village, in its often drily comic, wordless, ellipitical narrative, in its exquisite images, and in its focus on time and ritual, life and death. The four minimalist stories in the cyclical narrative here suggest an almost pantheistic take on the world, shifting from the human (an old goatherd who mixes church dust with water for his cough), through the animal (a newborn kid) and vegetable (a tree cut down for a village festival), to the mineral (charcoal burned by locals). Each transition evokes rebirth, but fear not: the films philosophical concerns are contained within a larger poetic schema that allows for much humour: herds of goat provide laughs aplenty, and one virtuoso long take boasts a brilliant comic performance from a dog. Very special.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Though the title of ace Brit documentarian Longinottos latest refers to a marauding sisterhood of lower caste Indian women who don these brightly coloured garments as a symbol of empowerment and independence, this harrowing film is actually about the sterling efforts of a single enforcer (Sampat Pal Devi) to ameliorate the lives of abused women and girls too afraid to speak up about their ill-treatment. Devi is a ball-busting force of nature, trampling on outmoded stricture and tradition to hammer-home her progressive agenda onto a society living in the shadow of violent male chauvinism. A little episodic and rambling to be called vintage Longinotto, but still another angry and articulate addition to a singular body of work.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An electric performance by Aidan Gillen (reteaming with director Jamie Thraves for the first time since 2000s The Low Down) is the cornerstone of this blackly funny but ultimately heartrending essay on loneliness and dependence that mixes the tender treatment of dysfunction of 'Rain Man' with the bleak urban redemption of The Fisher King. For reasons known only to himself, architect Tom (Tom Fisher) has abandoned his young family and taken to the streets of an anonymous south London where he forms a halting friendship with Gillens rambling half-witted naf. As their bond deepens  thanks in part to a kitten named Treacle Jr  the story gravitates toward a conclusion thats as hard won as it is inescapable. Funny, touching and gritty, this coolly rendered observation on need and rejection really is a Brit drama to shout about.<br />]]></review>

Some of them get possessed by evil spirits, and the frequent foulness of language is then replaced by nastiness of a different sort. A girl dances around a room with a bodiless arm clamped to her ankle (severed while a couple copulate in a coffin); a boy gets his eyes squished out by the bimbo who's putting him up; but the best bit is when a somewhat distraught young lady pushes her lipstick <i>inside</i> her left breast.

      <review><![CDATA[This impassioned polemical diatribe addresses the fate of the Jamaican economy. The island was freed from British colonialism in 1962, but since the oil crisis of the 1970s has been 'enslaved' and impoverished by the IMF and the World Bank. Jamaica Kincaid's book <i>A Small Place</i> (the title refers to her native Antigua) is used as a shaping narrative, extracts read in an angry tone by Belinda Becker. The film condemns the destructive effects of globalisation on Jamaica's industry and agriculture (onions, bananas and milk) and its culture in general, with particular reference to the so-called industrial 'free zones' set up by the US in Kingston to bypass import-export tariffs and normal tax legislation. Talking heads are intercut to synthesise theory and practice, but as an economic diatribe this is a bit patronising and not wholly persuasive.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A would-be black comedy in a rural British setting, this sees vicar Walter Goodfellow (Rowan Atkinson, of course) employing a housekeeper, Grace (Maggie Smith), who just happens to be a released murderer. Equally unimaginative casting comes in the form of Kristin Scott Thomas as a foul-mouthed, frustrated wife and Patrick Swayze as a pervy American golf pro who gets the village ladies in a spin. Grace sets about solving the Rev Goodfellows family problems in her own unique style while the family engage in farcical sitcom banter (sometimes funny, sometimes not). Its like dumping a serial killer into a very, very long episode of The Vicar of Dibley and expecting it to work: theres no artful black comedy here, just an uncomfortable clash between broad provincial humour and a murder plotline. The central cast are up to the job: Smith deadpans delightfully when she can, and Atkinson upgrades his bumbling Four Weddings and a Funeral performance to mildly amusing effect. But despite its genial characters, Keeping Mum is an undisciplined, ultimately unsuccessful experiment in British black comedy.]]></review>

Gallardo is a thoughtful and welcoming host, and his deep emotional attachment to the subject adds gravitas and emotional impact. But the look of the film tends toward the bland â a brace of brief animated sequences are cute but inessential â and it's hard to shake the feeling that 'Maria and I' would be more at home on television.]]></review>

Cue increased tension between dad (who takes to bemoaning his woes to their attractive young cleaner) and mum (whose attempts to help out her beloved boy by enlisting the efforts of his best friend have their own problematic outcomes), their spiralling troubles sounding echoes in the experiences of other family members. A very dry, very black comedy about the difficulties and responsibilities of living with others, and the degradation of emotions through self-serving fantasy, its as sharply bracing and refreshing as unsweetened lemon juice. <br />]]></review>

A tribute to the partisan soldiers who resisted Soviet rule in the 1950s, the film follows one such band of heavily armed, heavily bearded and largely indistinguishable freedom fighters as they roam the Romanian mountains, blagging food and shelter from the locals and getting picked off in a variety of sudden, meaningless ways. A handful of meticulously constructed set-piece battles aside, this is glum, episodic and eventually just exhausting, undermined yet further by an infuriating tendency towards crude, heavy-handed moral absolutism.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA['You were right, man! Sherlock Holmes was the pimp!' Yes, Holmes goes hipster for this wry, shabby and extremely likeable slice-of-life mystery from the writer-director of mumblecore gem 'Quiet City'. Cris Lankenau plays Doug, shiftless uni dropout and hometown returnee who interperses nights at the Portland ice factory with his developing interest in solving crimes. So when his ex-girlfriend goes mysteriously missing, Doug springs into action: casing her motel room, reading up on codebreaking and most importantly buying a pipe. Aaron Katz's characters are beautifully observed, and he sustains tension with unexpected skill. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Functioning as a similarly elegiac companion piece to '24 City', his 2008 examination of the dispersal of labourers from a factory in the Western Chinese province of Chengdu, director Jia Zhang-ke again looks at the ways in which time and âprogressâ chip away at the cultural and economic landscape, this time adopting the power hub of Shanghai as his subject. Piecing together a grand historical sweep from the tales told by a variety of sources (people of different ages, sexes and social backgrounds, and even excerpts from films by Lou Ye, Hou Hsiao-Hsien and Wang T'ung), it would help to do a little reading up on 20th century Shanghai history before you take this meditative journey. But to take pleasure from the way Jia uses his camera to rip raw emotion from the towering edifices of the city requires no background reading at all. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[If you had a chance to meet yourself as an eight-year-old, would that kid be happy with who you turned out to be? That's the premise, according to the blurb, of this Disney's offering. How it ever got beyond the pitch is a mystery. Willis is Russ Duritz, a cynical, short-tempered but successful image consultant who's missing something in life - and doesn't even realise it. That's when the kid (Breslin) arrives: a rambunctious klutz called Rusty who wheedles himself into Russ's life. Rusty, as it happens, is Russ as a youngster, and has unwittingly tripped back in time to help Russ, er, find himself. Sentimental moments are signposted by Marc Shaiman's typically bombastic score, but there's little to touch the heart here, since Russ and Rusty's predicament is completely nonsensical. Besides, how can we root for a smug workaholic who has everything and seems happy with it? Willis alone makes it just about endurable.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The 1950s. Lent in the Gascony village of Lansquenet. A red-hooded woman (Binoche) and child (Thivosol) boldly set about converting the old bakery into a chocolate shop which offers delights so tempting that hyper-conservative mayor Reynaud (Molina), fearing for the moral and religious health of the villagers, determines to eject her from the community. Well, what with Vianne's witchlike knowledge of their hearts' desires, the effrontery of her fashionable dress, her friendship with the despised 'river rats', led by handsome, Irish-accented Roux (Depp), she does stir some dangerous emotions in this backwater. Even so, the villagers rally to her life-affirming cause. From the start, Hallstrm's soft adaptation of Joanne Harris's popular novel-cum-magical fable smoothly proceeds to construct a 'feminist' parable about the role of courage, support and pleasure in personal transformation. But, however excellent the performances, their relevance is diminished by the historical bubble in which they're situated. Roger Pratt's 'period' cinematography preserves the whole in aspic.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Lukas is a meals-on-wheels delivery man, new to the job and the city, a loner on a short fuse. Isabella is the girl who picks him up on a bus with a 'Help me' note, kicks off the (platonic) relationship with a confession about dildo preferences, mysteriously vacillates between come-ons and disappearances, and lures him into loving her. Unsurprisingly, they're both damaged souls - indeed, right from the opening credits, everything in this film is dismally predictable, notwithstanding a raft of implausible characters, narrative details and scraps of 'colour'. Ludicrously contrived and clichd, it even sometimes seems like an extraordinarily absurdist black comedy; in fact, however, it's suggestive of a remake of <i>Taxi Driver</i> by someone who's only half-ingested what the New Austrian Cinema has to offer.

Nevertheless, he does have a hard time at school, where he's constantly bullied and often falsely blamed for others' misdeeds. He takes it all in his stride, however, because he knows he must be the chosen one when a fairy flutters into his life and instructs him to 'save the world'. This adaptation of Bjarne Reuter's children's novel may lack a satisfying denouement, but it's a charming little fable all the same.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Irreversible</i> pitches you straight into the abyss, revealing Cassel pounded to a pulp and his assailant's head staved in with a fire extinguisher; then it swivels into the past, negotiating the real-time agony of Bellucci being raped in an underpass, regressing ever backwards into the chaste light of earlier that day. Rest assured it all ends happily ever before. The title doesn't merely toy with the idea of undoing time, corruption, ruin and such shackles; it also brandishes the suggestion that the film itself poses a cinematic breach, a taboo-torching dereliction of no return. That's an exaggeration, of course, but there's no denying No's investment in the shock strategy of extreme realism, nor his virtuosity in the practice. Yet is it any more reprehensible a display than the similarly immersive opening of, say, <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>? And isn't No's implacably knowing, twisted relationship with his audience comparable to a more adolescent, swaggering Michael Haneke? You could choke on this nut. Morally banal, technically prodigal and dramatically packed with cheap ironies <i>Irreversible</i> may be, but, polemically at least, it's a tour de force.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hard to believe that 40 years have passed since the Pythons first stirred up the small screen with their unique brand of wacky post-Goons humour. This documentary is a companion to a forthcoming six-hour DVD set documenting the comedy troupes various ups and downs and will be shown at a series of one-off screenings on Tuesday September 29. The film  20 minutes too long but entertaining enough  opens in Pythonesque fashion with a pseudo-Shirley Bassey voice belting out a James Bond-style theme, before it settles into a string of interviews with surviving members, some chat-show excerpts of the late Graham Chapman and quips from more recent comics. The DVD set will surely go into greater detail, but from an editing point of view theyve managed to cover most bases, from the sextets early Beyond the Fringe performances through highlights from their TV series to their four movies. As dated as many Python sketches have become, theres bite in the old snake yet.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Isabelle Stevers first feature since the excellent Gisela again centres on an ordinary young woman caught up in an extraordinary situation: finding herself pregnant after an anonymous one-night stand, thirtysomething Simone not only bumps into the man in question at the hospital, but learns that hed been hoping to see her again and is quite happy to settle down with her. But is this all too good to be true? The film explores the psychological consequences of this course of events with admirable understatement, steering clear of moral commentary, and deploying colour, lighting, landscape and architecture rather than dialogue to evoke Simones mood swings. Annika Kuhls performance is very eloquent, too. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Set wholly in or within the grounds of a rambling, semi-derelict old mansion outside San Sebastian, this calm, measured, visually very beautiful blend of documentary, fiction and archive footage bears some resemblance to Tsai Ming-liangs Goodbye Dragon Inn' and Jose Luis Guerns Train of Shadows, but is amply rewarding in its own right. It takes a while to find out who the various people visiting and working in the house are, and as long to learn about the building itself, but a series of brief, often pawkily amusing conversations between two of the men comes slowly to focus on themes related to death, faith and the possibility of ongoing life: certainly the house, thanks to cinema, is alive with the ghosts of Basque history. Experimental but very accessible and humane, and quietly affecting.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Admittedly ambitious and admirable in focusing on two elderly women â one long happily married, one a lesbian living alone â whose friendship is revived, after decades apart, when they meet up again as visitors in a room shared by their respective relatives in a San Sebastian hospital, this well-meaning drama is flawed by its reliance on clichÃ©s of plotting and character. The comedy is a little too broad, the narrative occasionally contrived, even implausible, and its manipulative, even dismissive treatment of most supporting characters in its attempts to enlist sympathy for the central relationship smacks of unthinking cynicism. Still, it looks good, and the lead performances are not unappealing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A schizophrenic slice of Tarkovsky-lite that was one of the most talked-about titles at the 2010 Venice Film Festival, this mysterious chronicle of an ancient Merjan (northern Russian) death rite swiftly sullies its striking visuals by over-laying them with a turgid narration that too often bogs down proceedings in gloomy poetics. Following two gents as they collect, transport and cremate the cadaver of the deceased ex-wife of one of the pair, the question of how she died is brushed aside in favour of looking at the eccentric funeral traditions, including multi-coloured pubic hair braiding and a pyre constructed from axe handles and ignited using vodka. Its fascinating for about 45 mins, but sadly loses the thread on the home straight. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It feels like five movies have been fused together with reams of mystical gibberish for this bloated martial arts monster from legendary Hong Kong stunt co-ordinator Yuen Woo-ping. His film boasts some stunning fight sequences but suffers from a severe lack of purpose. Film one sees Vincent Zhao as the honourable General Su who is hoodwinked by his evil foster brother then left for dead. Film two sees Michelle Yeoh wander in as a rural herbalist, cure Su, then leave again. Film three is in 3D, and sees Su battling against the God of Wushu, who looks like a contortionist version of Colonel Gaddafi. Film four sees Su taking bloody revenge on his brother. And film five sees Su as a nomadic drunk, who finds himself in a death match against a team of Russian wrestlers managed by the late David Carradine. And then it stops.]]></review>

They make a pact: a âwish-listâ of all the things they would like to do before they kill themselves at the end of the year. He wants to fall in love and lose his virginity; she wants to forget her cheating boyfriend (Zayed Khan). Will they commit suicide on New Yearâs Eve or fall in love with each other? This genial yarn is unusual in that it focuses entirely on the two talented leads. They rise to the challenge and breathe credibility into a predictable journey. Different but not groundbreaking (an Indian woman loves only once!) this NRI (Non Resident Indian) bolly-romcom, set entirely in America, is undemanding and unpretentious.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its been 41 years since Manchester City last won the FA Cup and 34 years since they topped any kind of prominent league. But now, following a huge injection of cash in 2008 by the clubs new owner, Abu Dhabis Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the teams been able to splash out on a number of star players  including Emmanuel Adebayor and Carlos Tvez  in the hope of landing the number one spot in the Premier League. One suspects a little of the Sheikhs finances also went into the making of this reverential documentary, but lets not digress. <br />Putting aside ones concerns about the commercialisation of sport and, more importantly, how easily a struggling football team can be elevated from the bottom of the pile to the top tier simply through an injection of vast amounts of dosh, Stewart Suggs film actually turns out to be well structured, competently edited, often very tense and strangely entertaining. <br />What the film illustrates best is the notion of what it means to be a football fan. Its difficult for unbelievers like myself to grasp what drives the average supporter to heights of such emotional intensity but Sugg makes a fair fist of getting beneath the skin. Like any ardent supporter, the characters we follow absolutely live for the game. Little else matters. Every Man City match they watch seems to put them a step closer to the cardiac unit in A&amp;E, especially those games played against their most bitter rivals, United. Their ups and downs make for a fascinating 90 minutes of viewing. Unless, of course, youre a fan of Man U, Spurs, Chelsea, Arsenal <br />]]></review>

But Mars isnt just visually striking, its also full of humour, heart and super-cute cartoon Martians.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[âRuhrâ is an example of contemplative slow cinema at its most exacting. Which is to say it is not for all tastes. A handful of sequence shots from a fixed cam - ranging in duration from around ten to 30 mins - of scenes of industrial and community life in the eponymous German region (two roads, a Muslim prayer meeting, a wall being cleaned, a chimney billowing smoke), the film tests one's patience. But to allow yourself to be bored â and yes, that half-hour long shot of the chimney gets to be dull â is also to surrender to the precision of the compositions and painterly texture of the HD photography, a soothingly ambient soundscape of natural and manmade noises, and sly surprises unfolding within the patient frame of James Benningâs camera.<br />]]></review>

Sued by Jackie Onassis and punched out by Marlon Brando, Galella gained notoriety as much for his doggedness (which borders on the sociopathic) as for his photography, and Smash His Camera would benefit greatly from a little more of this tenacity. A half-hearted discussion of First Amendment rights concerning press freedom is given an airing by a fleet of talking heads, but Gast fails to get close to pinning Galella down, especially regarding his gross and repeated invasions of the privacy of his subjects. That said, it pings along with great energy and the snaps themselves have a life of their own]]></review>

Speckled with magical realist cine-thought bubbles which take the shape of line-drawn animations and even a dream sequence in which one sister has a discussion with her own alter-ego, the film singularly fails to say anything particularly complex or profound about the nature of object trading, and even at 82-minutes the film feels about an hour too long. It gets extra marks for the production design and ultra-clean shooting style, but you just wish director Hsiao Ya-Chuan put as much effort into his writing as his image making. <br />]]></review>

Scenes of their near-silent (but friendly) co-habitation are mixed with lengthy, Wiseman-esque docu-realist discussions with the locals whose vast array of ailments speak volumes about the fragility of the human body and the maladministration of local governments.

This slight but entertaining documentary follows their crusade against frat boys in daddyâs car, tight-wad SUV owners and people who canât park straight. In downtime they ponder the existential implications of the job, but are then seen throwing rocks at drivers who zoom off without paying. The parking lot could be seen as a microcosm of American society, or simply where a bunch of grad students earn a buck while venting their frustrations. Either way, itâs a fun place to hang out.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Daniel Burmeister is a film director with over 50 credits to his name. He has no formal training, no crew and a tendency to remake the same 4 or 5 scripts over and over again. And yet, he may be an artistic visionary. Burmeister's singular technique is to turn up in a small Argentinian town and announce that he's going to make a film - all he asks is food, lodging and volunteers to star in his latest opus. And so the townsfolk of BenjamÃ­n Gould (yep, that's a real place) turn out to help, playing brides and grooms, priests and firemen, con men and corpses. The result may be no masterpiece, but the quality is irrelevant: like some kind of handycam-wielding Pied Piper in reverse, Burmeister's true contribution is social cohesion, as the villagers work together to create something memorable. 'The Peddler' is a beautiful film, following Burmesiter as he preps, shoots, edits and screens his film for a delighted, invested audience: a genuinely positive experience.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Stumbling back and forth across the wonky line that separates the agreeably ramshackle from the outright slipshod, if this documentary about the beat writer William Burroughs succeeds at all then its on the calibre of the interviews with friends, acolytes and lovers. It settles down after an especially shaky start and splits itself into sections exploring various aspects of Burroughss life  homosexuality, drug addiction, firearms. But even though the title suggests the film is a character study and not a literary exploration, there isnt enough time spent on the mans writing to make for a complete portrait. Those unfamiliar with his work may come away with the feeling that Burroughs was only famous for blowing his wife's brains out and inventing punk rock.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Maybe it's the location shooting, maybe it's the performances, but Kazan's lyrical, liberal account of a Tennessee Valley Authority agent (Clift) struggling to persuade an obstinate old woman (Fleet) to abandon her home before it is flooded by a new project, is one of his least theatrical and most affecting films. Partly that's because the battle lines - between city and country, old and new, expediency and commitment - are effectively blurred, making the conflict more dramatically complex than one might expect; but Kazan's evident nostalgia for the '30s (New Deal) setting also lends the film greater depth and scope than is usually to be found in his work.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Slow, elliptical, and for the most part understated, Yang's masterly account of growing up in Taiwan at the start of the '60s is as visually elegant as his own <i>Taipei Story</i> and <i>The Terroriser</i>, and as epic in scope as Hou Xiaoxian's <i>City of Sadness</i> (which Yang produced). On the surface, it's about one boy's involvement in gang rivalry and violence (on which level, it's often a little obscure, so numerous are the characters) and his experience of young love. On a deeper level, however, it's about a society in transition and in search of an identity, forever aware of its isolation from mainland China, and increasingly prey to Americanisation. The measured pace may be off-putting, but stay with it - the accumulated wealth of detail invests the unexpected final scenes with enormous, shocking power.]]></review>

Williams' Genie is matched by Freeman's malevolent Jafar, and by Gottfried as Jafar's wisecracking parrot Iago. The only disappointments are the wet Aladdin and his sweetheart Jasmine and five rather ordinary original songs.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[That rare animal, a rock documentary which entertains and informs in equal quantities,<i> The Kids Are Alright</i> is a movie that comes over as a celebration of rock'n'roll itself as much as of one of its more masterful exponents. Covering The Who's 'turbulent' history from the days of sweaty Shepherd's Bush cellars to the super-technicalities required for the recording of 'Who Are You' (mercifully stopping before Moon's death), the film captures some of the most powerful rock music of the last two decades. Patching together snippets of hilarious interviews (witness the anarchic terror Moon wreaks on a panic-stricken Russell Harty) with footage of live gigs (culminating in a laser-streaked finale), plus a few fantasy sequences, the film will fascinate the under-twenties and delight the over-thirties.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Adapted from Thorne Smith's fantasy about sexual role reversal, this probably seemed daring once, but hasn't worn well. An Indian sculpture with magical powers, tired of endless quarrels between a married couple (Hubbard, Landis) as to who has the best of the marriage contract, grants their wish to change roles. So while she (Hubbard, dubbed with Landis' voice and indulging excruciatingly stereotyped camp mannerisms) goes to work as an advertising executive, he (Landis, dubbed with Hubbard's voice and striding out a bit) tries to cope with the housewife's lot. Causing endless havoc and confusion, both are relieved when their wish to return to normal - prompted by Hubbard's fearful discovery that he/she is pregnant - is granted. The marital status quo is never questioned for a moment, of course; and the revelation that the statue made a mistake in rectifying matters - the husband is now pregnant - is chickenheartedly thrown away as a curtain line. The best bits come from the supportingcast, especially Pangborn and Meek, archetypal Preston Sturges characters without the Sturges dialogue to bring them fully to life.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Fusing zombie apocalypse with gangster violence, French co-directors Yannick Dahan and Benjamin Rocher trap a hit squad of four corrupt, vengeful white cops and a vicious, multi-racial drug gang in a deserted Parisian tower block surrounded by thousands of hungry, undead ghouls. The police were planning to take revenge for the murder of their colleague, but are forced to form a volatile alliance with their enemies, and bury the hatchet in some zombie flesh. <br />More of a relentless, action-packed thriller than a horror movie as such, La Horde nevertheless features copious amounts of gruesome violence. A scantily-clad Claude Perron is chilling as the morally blank female cop Aurore, and theres a darkly comic cameo by Alain Figlarz, as the buildings eccentric, ex-army caretaker. Whether the film does enough to earn its nihilistic ending is open to debate, but if we see the zombies as President Sarkozys dispossessed scum, rising up to take over the streets, this latest example of the French new wave of horror does at least have the Romero-like guts to address a topical social problem.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival</i><br />Age, happiness and the passing of time are the themes that percolate movingly through Mike Leighs Another Year, his first film since 2008s punchy, upbeat Happy-Go-Lucky. Its a serious, meditative but powerful drama that explores a year in the life of a contented, endearing professional couple in their early sixties and the friends and family who cross their path.<br />The mood is gently resigned, questioning but not accusing of its protagonists choices. How happy would you say you are? asks one character of another. Its a question we  and Leigh  ask of everyone we meet in this seasonal ensemble piece. The main characters, Gerri and Tom (Ruth Sheen and Jim Broadbent), are a married couple whose domestic and professional lives are happy and stable: Gerri is an NHS counsellor who, in the first scene, is deep in conversation with a depressed patient played by Imelda Staunton (her only appearance), while Tom is a commercial geologist. <br />Beyond these early snapshots of their working lives, we mostly spend time with Gerri and Tom at home in a comfortable suburban semi and with the friends and family who enjoy sharing time and space with them.Gerri and Tom, we come to feel, are one of lifes success stories, but their cosy situation sits in stark contrast with many of those around them. Ken (Peter Wight) is Toms childhood friend who eats and drinks too much and misfires on the romantic front; Ronnie (David Bradley),Toms brother, is a silent, lost figure; and Mary (Lesley Manville), a long-time friend of Gerris, is a glass-half-full depressive who manages to be upbeat when sober but is awkwardly flirtatious or downright miserable about the prospects of spinsterhood after a few glasses of wine. <br />In some ways, Gerri and Tom are mere foils for Mary, their occasional house guest and perhaps Leighs main interest, whose nervous personality comes to light in her flirtations with Gerri and Toms  laidback son Joe (Oliver Maltman). While many of Leighs films have explored upheavals in the lives of their protagonists (Vera in Vera Drake, Phil and Penny in All Or Nothing), Another Year feels different in mood and structure: more contemplative, less confrontational, more at ease with the gentle passage of time.<br />With Another Year, Leigh seems more interested in what doesnt change in our lives than what does: our long-term selves, rather than our short-term experiences. Time passes, events happen (some within our control, some not), but fate proves the most powerful force. Within this, there are many other more specific interests: the legacy of the 1968, university-educated generation; the role of alcohol in our social lives; our self-awareness relating to our age and that of others; and what we pass on, emotionally, to our kids.<br />But this is a cyclical, rather than explosive film. If any character experiences a jolt in their day-to-day life, its Mary, after a difficult encounter with Joes new girlfriend. The films final, lingering shot of Marys face as others talk around her at the dinner table suggests that she knows the horrible truth is that ones essence  and the fate that drives it  is hard to alter. Lifes not always kind, is it? asks Gerri. It could be the films subtitle.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival</i><br />Its back to business for Ken Loach. The veteran British director is back in competition at Cannes, just a year after his crowd-pleasing Looking for Eric screened at the festival, with Route Irish, a film that channels Loachs righteous anger at the grotesque carnival of the Iraq war into a Liverpool-set story about the murky world of private contractors returning from war zones. The film brims over with insights into a world little explored by dramas about the Iraq conflict, offering a powerful view on the topic by setting its intrigue almost entirely on British soil. The message is that the Iraq war and others like it might be foreign, but their impact implicates us all. However, while the films fury is compelling, its story sometimes feels a little wandering, and with many byroads and side alleys, it lacks the simple fury and debate of Loachs very best films.<br />Route Irish brings the war back home by following Fergus (Mark Womack), a former soldier and private contractor in Liverpool who is trying to come to terms with the death of childhood friend Frankie (John Bishop). We meet Fergus on the Mersey ferry and then as he prises open Frankies coffin in a deserted church at night, determined to see his friend one last time. Its a troubling, arresting scene. By the time of the funeral the next day, Fergus is already becoming suspicious of how his friend came to be blown up on Route Irish, the infamous and dangerous road that links Baghdads Green Zone with the citys airport. Its this suspicion that drives the film: Fergus starts to throw questions at representatives of the security firm for which he and Frankie both worked, and his worries are fuelled further when a friend of Frankie gives him a phone containing footage from Baghdad in the days before Frankies death.<br />Although theres a mystery at its core, and its unravelling propels the film forward, Route Irish is better at introducing and exploring the personalities whose lives are affected by war than finding answers to a specific case. Theres a conflict between the films thriller structure  with its fast flow of Skype conversations with witnesses in Iraq, encounters with Iraqis living in Liverpool and showdowns with wealthy private contractors  and its concern with relationships and emotions. The strange rapport, part sexual, part familial, between Fergus and Frankies girlfriend, Rachel (Andrea Lowe), is intriguing but not fully explored, and it would have been good to know more about Ferguss friendships with his friends, such the one played by Craig Lundberg, himself a blind ex-soldier who lost his sight in Iraq. As ever, such authentic touches as the casting of Lundberg distance the film from the easy feel of quick entertainment, though there is a certain awkwardness among the less experienced or non-professional actors.<br />These reservations aside, the character of Fergus, played with desperate vigour by Womack, is a triumph of the political made personal. The scenes in which he bounces off the sterile walls of his luxury but soulless riverside apartment, bought with the proceeds of his time as a contractor (earning 10,000 a day, he says), speak volumes about the corrupt and unpredictable journeys of war. A scene, too, in which Fergus water-boards Walker (Geoff Bell), a former colleague, is claustrophobic and unsettling, managing to both convey how psychologically beaten Fergus is and to remind us of one of the more unpalatable instruments of conflicts abroad.<br />The mood is bleak and angry, a tone compounded by cold, direct photography from Chris Menges (Kes, The Killing Fields) and a script by Loachs collaborator Paul Laverty that refuses to be distracted from the personal horror of war, both here and in Iraq, where we witness bombings, shootings and beatings, mostly via archive footage, although Loach did travel to Jordan to shoot some scenes. Its an uneven film, offering a gut punch in parts but failing to keep a strong and clear focus in others  but its a necessary and energetic work, and one that brings a foreign war right back home and refuses to treat it as a distant or academic problem.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Godard claims this is his last film. If so, its a fitting exit for European cinemas genius grouch: angry, politicised, inquiring, brimming with ideas, disdainful of the audience and impossible to categorise. The film falls loosely into three sections. The first, and longest, falls between documentary and drama as we join a ferry making its way across the Mediterranean. Various passengers, including Smith, discuss history, politics and globalisation, with one African actor speaking for an entire continent on the ships deck  Poor Europe, she says, humiliated by suffering. The English subtitles offer only keywords (Navajo English, Godard calls it) and further stress his campaign against the tyranny of our language. The second segment is an abstract play set in an Italian petrol station and featuring a llama (a comment on fuel dependency and South America?). The third is a rapid-fire collage of archive footage under various titles of place names including Odessa, Egypt and Palestine. The visual style is aggressive: crisp HD images give way to mobile-phone footage; sounds cuts in and out and wind bashes against the microphone. Dense and difficult, 'Film Socialisme' refuses to reveal itself in one viewing, and Godard is no help: No Comment, scoffs the final frame. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2010 Venice 
Film 
Festival</i><br />There was a minor (very minor) controversy earlier this year when Julian Schnabels new movie Miral was supposedly not offered a spot in the competition line-up at Cannes, leading to its premiere in competition at Venice four months later. Upon seeing this worthy but flatulent film, this rumour starts to make a lot of sense: it couldve made what was deemed a poor Cannes into a truly awful one.<br />The film is based on a 2004 book by Palestinian-born, European-based journalist Rula Jebrea, who also contributed the screenplay, and comprises an episodic examination of Israeli political history between 1947 and 1994. Maintaining the slick, gizmo-heavy visual style that he used to such immersive effect in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (washed-out colour palettes and fish-eye lenses), Schnabel tells a broadly political story rather than an intensely personal one, and as such theres a whopping gulf between the seriousness of the material and the playfulness of the technique. Miral also demonstrates a severe lack of storytelling aptitude, offering numerous narrative focal points but mustering little curiosity value from any of them. <br />Miral, as an initial intertitle informs us, is a little red flower the grows on the side of the road  youve probably seen them a million times. It loosely pertains to one of the films many strands, the fostering of displaced Palestinian children during the post-war period. Sage philanthropist Hind Husseini (Siam Abbas) uses her fortune to open an all-purpose foster home-cum-boarding school, hoping to ensure that future generations will have the gift of knowledge, something she believes is lacking in the reactionary current regime. <br />A long, exposition-heavy build-up takes in numerous fleeting side players whose presence connotes historical point-scoring rather than narrative necessity. Willem Dafoe turns up in small role as an American attache stationed in the area, and his visit to Husseinis orphanage exists simply to allow Schnabel an easy way to give a no-frills cross-section of the suffering. Its not until 45 minutes in that Freida Pinto's Miral is introduced, and even then its only after an overly detailed chapter covering the woes of her upbringing.<br />Finally, the film settles on Mirals dalliances with a PLO cell and her choice between using her book-smarts to help the young and vulnerable or joining the fight on the front line. Scenes of capture, torture and abuse of power ensue as we see that Miral has chosen the latter route, a trail blazed by a friend seen in flashback planting a bomb in a cinema as a Jewish audience watches Repulsion. Pasting over cracks with stock footage of urban combat, the film skips over a large and complex period of history with a light-footedness that offers little new or interesting. Abbas is fine as the iron-willed mother figure, even if the make-up used to age her is less than subtle. Pinto does well with what shes been given, but that doesnt amount to a whole lot. This is history reduced to platitudes, and its final call for peace doesnt feel earned. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Even if it had no other virtues, Bertrand Taverniers film of Madame de la Fayettes novel should be applauded for showing up the clich-ridden vacuity of Ridley Scotts Robin of the Hood (as the French title almost has it). No displays of CGI virtuosity here; no Pythonesque emphasis on muck; no resort to legendary stereotypes or apeing of contemporary fashions; just a good story well told, with excellent performances, a properly researched but never flashy attention to historical detail, and a clear sense of what the film is actually meant to be about.<br />The Princess in question is Marie de Mzires, a beautiful young heiress in love with the Duc de Guise but promised to his brother. The film begins in 1562 when her father, receiving a better offer, reneges on the agreement and has her married to Philippe, Prince de Montpensier, whose friend and mentor the Comte de Chabannes  banished as a deserter after he gave up killing during the war between the Catholics and Huguenots  is enlisted to educate the young woman. Its awkward enough when this older man  not just a soldier, but a scientist, philosopher and aesthete  secretly falls for his charge; far more problematic, however, is the jealousy felt and angrily expressed by Philippe when it becomes clear that de Guise still wants Marie. And then theres the kings brother, the Duc dAnjou<br />Its a fairly complex story, then, but Taverier handles it with the assurance characteristic of his finest work; hes as at home with the brutal battle sequences as he is with the more intimate scenes between Marie and her various admirers. Hes helped no end by a cast of largely unknown young actors; for most of us, only Lambert Wilson, extremely effective as Chabannes, will be familiar, though one cant help feeling that the likes of Mlanie Thierry, Gaspard Ulliel and Raphal Personnaz  all extremely good-looking and all very effective as Marie, de Guise and Anjou respectively  will be returning to our screens with some regularity. Philippe Sardes music and Bruno de Keyzers Scope camerawork are also deserving of special mention. Old-fashioned it may be, but Taverniers film impresses from start to finish.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival<br /></i><br />With just two fiction features (the second being the Cannes prize-winning The Death of Mr Lazarescu) and one short, Romanias Cristi Puiu had already established himself among the most promising of Europes younger filmmakers. Now, with his bold third feature, he proves that he is one of the most distinctive artists working in cinema anywhere today.<br />Aurora is not exactly an easy movie; it runs for three hours and covers about one and a half days in the life of a man we first see about to get out of bed with a woman; she might be his wife, though the way the man lurks in the shadows when a girl appears calling for her mummy suggests we shouldnt be too sure. Indeed, throughout the film there remains a considerable degree of ambiguity, even mystery, to this mans actions and motives as he wanders and drives about the city, always watchfully; who is he, where does he live, what is his relationship to the various people he encounters, and why is he fixing up that rifle?<br />Its a film of endless questions, then, and only in the last few minutes are some (but far from all) of them answered. Whatever else you may read about the film, its not so much about the act of killing as about what there might be in any of us that might just move us, in very particular circumstances, to kill. The elliptical, mostly dialogue-free narrative simply follows the man around, observing his gait, his gaze, his unconscious gestures; it is left to the directors own extraordinarily eloquent (if unusually taciturn) performance to suggest the complex tangle of emotions and thoughts going through the clearly perturbed protagonists mind.<br />Aurora will not be to everyones taste, but it is undoubtedly the work of an audacious, intelligent writer-director (and, at least for now, actor) whos both ready and very able to deal with areas of human experience of which many other filmmakers seem barely to be aware. It was the inescapable fact of mortality in Mr Lazarescu; here it is the pain and confusion of just being alive. And Puius special approach to the realist aesthetic ensures that Aurora rings unusually true. Superb stuff.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival <br /></i><br />One of the biggest accusations facing Alejandro Gonzalez Irritu after Babel was that he had overstretched himself: by hopping from California and Mexico to Japan and Morocco, he was searching for overarching, spiritual meaning but only coming up with hysterical, empty melodrama that relied far too heavily on narrative cross-cutting and coincidence. Since then, hes parted from writer Guillermo Arriaga, with whom he also made 21 Grams and Amores Perros, but theres still much familiar about Biutiful, which Irritu wrote with two new writers.<br />Once again, a proximity to death is top of the menu, along with quasi-religious awakenings prompted by extreme events in ordinary lives. Again, too, the films look is one of stylised decay, the camerawork is fast and frenetic and Irritu looks to the conflict and contrasts between various story strands for power and meaning.<br />But theres a feeling with Biutiful that Irritu is striving to challenge those criticisms of superficiality. He restricts his story to a run-down neighbourhood of Barcelona, where Uxbal (Javier Bardem) lives with his two kids and has a fractious relationship with an alcoholic and often estranged wife (Maricel Alvarez). His professional life is colourful: he runs drug dealers on the citys streets and, with his sleazy brother, is involved in touting illegal Chinese immigrants to local building sites. Irritu seems to like him though: he does his best to look after his kids, he cares for his wayward wife and he even shows compassion when dealing with the African dealers and Chinese workers.<br />Irritu is best when wowing us with individual scenes. A sweep of drug dealers by the police in the city centre is handled brilliantly; theres a funny, suffocating scene involving loud music, a phone-call, red wine and Uxbals wife and brother; and theres an impressive scene set in a club towards the end.<br />But Irritu cant help but take his story down distracting roads. A sub-plot involving a tragedy that befalls a group of Chinese immigrants is crass and the generosity shown by an African friend of Uxbal is hard to believe. Bardem is on compelling, firing-all-cylinders form in the lead role, but its never entirely clear why Irritu thinks this guy is such a hero and the almost supernatural instinct for empathy and understanding he affords him never makes much sense. The film is best when trying to understand Uxbal as a husband and father, and when Inarritu lets his camera roll on longer, conversational scenes and gives his editor a break, it shows that theres more to him than empty gestures.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival</i><br />Tensions between fathers and sons and a background of civil war rear their heads again in this fourth film from Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, the Paris-based, Chad-born director of Bye Bye Africa, Abouna and Daratt. Harouns simple framing and pared-down storytelling once more offer a contemporary parable about life in modern west Africa and create welcome space for the exploration of a few essential themes. Its a confident, controlled work, which boasts a sensitive performance from lead actor Youssouf Djaoro (who played the baker and father in Daratt).<br />We watch as economics and war conspire to disrupt the routine of ageing Adam (Djaoro), who, having been Central Africas swimming champion in 1965, now spends his days guarding a pool in a hotel in the Chad capital, NDjamena, helped by his teenage son Abdel (Diouc Koma). Theres news on the radio of an inflamation of hostilities in Chads ongoing civil war and financial pressures cause the hotels Chinese owners to sack a loyal Congolese cook and transfer Adam from pool duties to guarding the hotels front entrance.<br />Adam is devastated by these changes  The pools my whole life  and his sadness and growing sense of his own age and mortality is compounded when he discovers that his son has taken over his old job. Not long after these events, Adam, under great pressure from local chief Ahmat (Emil Abossolo MBo), makes a fateful decision to contribute to the governments war effort in a manner that has serious repercussions for his future and his family.<br />Haroun is a filmmaker who communicates in direct, simple images: he much prefers a slow zoom in to a close-up on Adams face than a monologue about his predicament. One assumes that Haroun believes these are people who are unwilling or unable to communicate their fears, although we witness tender and frank conversations between Adam and his friend the sacked cook.<br />The films images and themes are more memorable and persuasive than its relationships and plot turns, some of which tend towards the unconvincing. But A Screaming Man has a slow, cumulative power and is a moving comment on how war corrupts in the most unlikely and unnatural of ways. The film is perhaps a little too similar to Daratt to suggest that Haroun has developed and progressed a great deal since that film, but he remains one of Francophone African cinemas leading talents.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival<br /></i><br />Rumour has it that Thierry Frmaux wanted to include Olivier Assayas five-hours-plus account of Carlos the Jackals activities from the mid-70s until his death in competition at this years Cannes, but was overruled because the film was made for French TV channel Canal +. It ended up receiving a special out-of-competition screening, but judging by the rapturous reception it received, its perhaps a pity Frmaux didnt get his way.<br />Certainly, the film doesnt feel anything like television. Its shot in Scope, boasts the fleet way with narrative, camera movement and cutting that are characteristic of Assayas at his best and has a sense of scale, depth and seriousness of purpose that is esssentially cinematic. The closest comparison, I suppose, would be Soderberghs Che; though Assayas film is formally more conventional, it displays a similar interest both in providing plenty of historical detail and in exploring certain ideological issues. That said, its more of a straightforward character study than Soderberghs examination of the revolutionary process, and in that respect it benefits from a superb performance from Edgar Ramrez in the title role.<br />He receives strong support from the rest of the cast, and there is no denying that Carlos is a very impressive achievement. Its just a pity that the third and final part runs out of steam a little; having combined intelligent political discussion with some gripping action sequences during the first three and a half hours, Assayas finds himself constrained by history itself, as the last act becomes a matter of Carlos simply moving from hiding place to hiding place until his inevitable capture. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2010 Toronto Film Festival<br /></i><br />Kazuo Ishiguros award-winning novel (the best of the decade, as per Time magazine) is transposed to the screen with something like deference by producer Andrew Macdonald and screenwriter Alex Garland  the team that gave us The Beach; 28 Days Later and Sunshine). <br />The third part of that team, director Danny Boyle, has gone his own way of course, and you wont find any trace of his dynamism in Mark Romaneks cool, self consciously drab compositions and patient, controlled tempo. Its been eight years since Romaneks over-determined thriller One-Hour Photo, and he hasnt loosened up any. <br />The material here is stronger, and his solemnity is hardly misplaced, but it makes for a glum watch. Like the characters, you wind up casting about for even the unlikeliest escape route. A high-brow science fantasy story trimmed of most of the science and keeping the fantasy under lock and key, Never Let Me Go is an artful tease and a tragic romance played out over three decades in an imaginary recent past. <br />At Hailsham, in the late 1970s, Kathy, Tommy and Ruth grow up in a boarding school (or is it an orphanage?) so fiercely protective none of the children has ever set foot outside the grounds. They are schooled in basic social interactions  how to order in a caf for instance  and encouraged to draw and paint, but for what purpose they have only the vaguest idea. Kathy has eyes for Tommy, but her best friend Ruth has her own designs. <br />Ten years later, as teenagers (and now played by Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley), they are permitted to move up to the next stage in their development, entering the world on a day-release basis. By now their fate is becoming clearer  or rather, darker <br />Safe to say the less you know beforehand, the more youll find to chew over. The trouble is, as the film slowly reveals its secrets there is ample time for nagging doubts to gnaw away at its credibility. If Romanek refrains from showing us the big picture, were tempted to fill it up with plot holes. <br />The allegory rings a mite hollow, but the film works quite well as a love story. Mulligan confirms her newly won status with a watchful, still, compassionate performance, and Garfield (and his younger alter-ego, Charlie Rowe) is very touching as the emotionally wide-open Tommy, the apex of the love triangle. In the trickier role of Ruth, Knightley hits the right note of conceited faux-sophistication.]]></review>

But as Sosa tries  partly out of self-respect, partly to impress Lujn  to dissociate himself from a company that exploits accident victims by fleecing them of most of the proceeds of insurance claims, the film turns steadily into a taut, suspenseful noir thriller, alert to the psychological needs and doubts of its clearly star-crossd lovers and to the visceral physicality of both hospital work and criminal violence alike. Darin and Gusman, each of them excellent, receive sterling support from the rest of the cast, while superb camerawork and editing create a mood of tense immediacy from the attention-catching start to the spiralling chaos of the extraordinarily gripping finale. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A British upper-middle class family on holiday again offers a fruitful focus for writer-director Hogg, who follows her debut, Unrelated, from 2007 with another intimate and painful story of misunderstanding and miscommunication delivered with an uneasy naturalism defined by long, uninterrupted takes, mostly void of close-ups, and the shakiness of improvisation. This time, the sun of Tuscany is substituted for the gloom of the Isles of Scilly as we join a mother and her two grown-up children (one played by Tom Hiddleston of 'Unrelated'), plus their hired cook (cue wincing class tension) for a weeks holiday in a rented cottage without their pertinently absent father. Its an aching, uncomfortable portrait of silent despair and communal discord.]]></review>

Setting up his camera in the tumbledown maze of gaffer tape and tattered boxing posters that it Lords Gym in Austin, Texas, Wiseman simply observes a clientele of mixed gender, age and background as they spar, practice, interact, chat and work out without a hint of aggression or machismo. Wiseman's love of people is palpable, and the militant objectivity of his technique has rarely felt so compassionate. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Winner of the inaugural Queer Palm at Cannes, Arakis college-campus spin on Twin Peaks is a dumb and fun B-movie that celebrates students, sex and the supernatural. Smith (Dekker) is a bisexual student who shares a room with Thor (Zylka), a physically blessed but intellectually challenged surfer dude; hangs out with Stella (Bennett), a sharp-tongued artist; and has a loose sexual relationship with London (Temple), a super-cool free spirit. But Smith is worried: his dreams, which depict the murder of a red-haired girl, start to be reflected in real life, and then strange creatures start to haunt him on campus. Funny, bizarre and self-aware, this is an entertaining romp from Araki, who refuses to take himself too seriously. His portrait of student life is wild and exaggerated, and his cast, especially Temple, hit exactly the right self-mocking tone. And just when you wonder just how Araki is going to maintain a plot that keeps piling nonsense on nonsense, you realise the films saving grace: he simply doesnt care. Its a romp, pure and simple.<br />]]></review>

In effect, this is the biopic of a poem: the events leading to its creation, the intensive writing process and the cultural fallout when it was published â scathing reviews, an obscenity trial, instant notoriety. The poem is illustrated in vibrant, hallucinatory, occasionally overcooked animated sequences, the courtroom sequences provide much-needed levity and Franco's committed, selfless central performance is a revelation.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The second film this year on the subject of the immigrant Welsh community in Argentina after Gruff Rhys's scruffy, likeable 'Separado!', 'Patagonia' is a glum, soap-operatic melodrama tracking two pairs of wayward characters as they embark on life-altering road trips. While troubled Welsh couple Gwen and Rhys bicker their way across the Pampas, elderly emigre Cerys brings her teenage neighbour Alejandro back to the valleys to hunt down her family homestead. Evans's eye for landscape is impressive, but his narrow focus on this quartet of dull, platitudinous cardboard cutouts renders the film predictable and tedious. A cameo from popstrel <i>du jour</i> Duffy is sweet but superfluous.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Do you remember the British artist Gillian Wearing's photos from the mid-1990s of people holding up white cards on which they scrawled confessions? Now Wearing brings her studies in identity and self-projection to cinema with this documentary record of a collaboration between her and Sam Rumbelow, a London-based Method acting teacher. Seven daring non-actors, each with personal issues of varying complexity, answer a newspaper advert and join a cathartic workshop with Rumbelow to explore themselves through theatre. What we witness is raw and sometimes uncomfortable as Rumbelow pushes them to reveal themselves. Five finally appear in short films: one deals with father issues by playing Cordelia in an extract from King Lear; another reflects her relationship fears in a 1940s-set piece about courtship. Documentary segues into drama, and the film is a lucid, concise prcis of a project of great emotional intensity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In the field of movies involving precocious children frolicking in the countryside, the French are world leaders, and this rabble-rousing immigration drama from Romain Goupil is another fine addition to this swelling sub-genre. The film offers an unsentimental look at 10-year-old Chechen girl Milana (Linda Doudaeva) whoâs living in Paris illegally with her family and who is threatened with extradition. Egged on by the wide-eyed pleas of her scampish young son, Blaise (Jules Ritmanic), world-weary Cendrine (Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi) decides to take Milana under her wing to help her evade the cops. Part dystopic political satire, part âJust Williamâ-esque ode to the purity of childhood, Goupilâs film manages to ooze charm, mood and romance as it angrily denounces a political system built on a bedrock of false ideals.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A deceptively easeful movie, writer-director Isabelle Czajkas engaging second feature follows the plight of Julie (played lustily by Anas Demoustier), an initially hopeful provincial arts graduate in the Parisian job market. The realities of working as an assistant at a prestigious PR agency or a sales trainee at a publishing company erode Julie's self-esteem, encourage adventurous sexual outlets and make her prey for the unorthodox and the risky, as personified by an enigmatic charmer (rising star Pio Marma). As Czajkas freshly acted, sprightly directed, insightful but never heavy nor didactic movie follows its young lovers on the potentially dangerous road south, she makes a seductive transition from an ironic and delicately scornful Laurent Cantet-style examination of the world of work to a look at love and freedom that probes keenly at the heart of the conventional romantic escapist drama.]]></review>

Debut director Katell QuillÃ©vÃ©rÃ© mixes this heady brew of contradictory emotions with great delicacy and attentiveness to fine detail, and her film has a relentless inertia to it despite the fact that each episode it chronicles (the declining health of a grandparent, a messy divorce, a local pastor in crisis) doesnât feel tailored to a single cause. Augarde carries the film with ease, though you canât help but feel in the end that QuillÃ©vÃ©rÃ© is simply going over terrain that has been well trodden by the likes of Eric Rohmer, Maurice Pialat and Catherine Breillat. But still, it's a good path to be on.<br />]]></review>

So begins a series of adventures and encounters, mainly a haunting reminder of what heâs lost over the years but also, very often, bizarrely and even outrageously funny (one scene with an elderly relative is particularly memorable).

'Catfish' is a documentary made by two smug, blissfully self-absorbed New York media twentysomethings about a relationship forged on the internet, but that's as much as can be revealed without giving the movie away. On one level it's a horribly exploitative, intellectually unadventurous and emotionally manipulative trawl through the darker reaches of the social network. On another, it's a gripping, alarming, ultimately devastating portrait of the desperate struggle for meaningful discourse in the modern world. Either way, this is essential viewing.]]></review>

Tony Barry takes over the role of Preston Sr, whose recollections of war, capture in the desert and internment in Italy, illustrated with reenactments and archive footage, are admittedly fascinating. But his daughter's decision to puncture the mood by continually cutting back to soft focus, pastel-hued scenes of her worrying, wayward mother back in New Zealand make the entire film feel glossy, shallow and rather bland.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A movie about a trailer-park dwelling high school hermaphrodite who enters a dance contest shouldn't have to work too hard to be quirky, but 'Spork' still puts a lot of effort into scoring indie-oddball credibility. Teen TV vet Savannah Stehlin is superb as the genitally challenged title character, whose wayward path through the adolescent jungle includes run-ins with Britney-holic rich bitches, loudmouth breakdance mavens and one very confused Judy Garland wannabe. But director J B Ghuman Jr just can't hold himself back, chucking animation, split-screen, slapstick and some rather dubious racial stereotypes into an already overloaded stylistic and thematic mishmash. The result is heartfelt but dangerously hyperactive.<br />]]></review>

Some of these musicians feature in this lively adaptation of Knights book, which centres around a student house in New York populated by a bunch of Muslim misfits  skaters, skinheads, and a riot grrrl in a burka  who pray by day and party by night. What this rough-around-the-edges but hugely likeable film lacks in budget it more than makes up for in energy, visual flair and, yes, punk spirit.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Bertolucci's engrossing, elegant film is a seductive adaptation by Gilbert Adair of his novel <i>The Holy Innocents</i>. In Paris, as a student in the spring of 1968, Matthew (Pitt) is a young American usually to be found glued to the smoke-stained silver screen at the Palais de Chaillot. There, during a demo against the government's firing of Henri Langlois as head of the Cinmathque, he meets and falls in with Isabelle (Green) and Tho (Garrel), a brother and sister as beautiful as they are bent on making their lives resemble the movies they adore - <i>Les Enfants Terribles</i>, perhaps? When they invite him to move into their apartment while their parents are on holiday, the relationship becomes more intimate, and intense. Meanwhile, things are also heating up out on the streets. An evocative reminiscence of an era when cinema and politics could count for as much as carnal passion, this delicious movie is written and directed with feeling and flair, and played to near perfection by its appealing young leads. The film benefits hugely from the fact that Bertolucci and Adair were caught up in the exhilarating mood of change that made '68 a year to savour. Besides being stylish, sexy and witty, the film feels authentic. The mnage--trois and its members are treated sympathetically but never romanticised; the cinphile allusions are many, correct, illuminating but never overdone; the music is equally well chosen and expressive; the shifts between the erotic hothouse atmosphere of the apartment and the heady air of liberation outside skilfully handled. A real pleasure.]]></review>

Taken to the police station for a spot of persuasion, he suffers flash recalls of torture in Vietnam. Going momentarily berserk, and hounded like a mad dog, he leads his pursuers a frightening dance through the woods before returning to give the town its comeuppance. As a Stallone vehicle this is sleek, slick and not unexciting, but crassly castrates the David Morrell novel on which it is based. Read the book: tough, provocative, savagely ironical and infinitely more complex, it's much better value.]]></review>

But is it 'evil' scheming? Preminger's cool, detached camera scuttles between a wintry black-and-white present and Technicolor flashbacks to summer on the Riviera to provide the necessary evidence, but leaves us, the audience, to draw the conclusions.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Schwarzenegger went from <i>The Terminator</i> to the human equivalent of boys' action figures in this none-too-serious gung-ho adventure, where his former covert agent John Matrix takes the fight back to the reactionary baddies who've kidnapped his daughter and are set on restoring a fascist tyrant to power in the Central American state of 'Val Verde'. Lots of machine-gunfire, explosions and disposable khaki-clad extras, as you'd expect. Occasional suggestions that the tongue might be slightly in cheek include the risible bonding-with-small-daughter fishing trip under the opening credits and pronounced homo-erotic badinage with his final-reel adversary. 'Think of sticking your knife into my flesh - and twisting it,' Arnie hisses at Vernon Wells, the leather-clad, handlebar-moustached heavy, who might just have come from a Village People lookalike contest.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Partly based on Friedrich Drrenmatt's play <i>The</i> <i>Visit</i>, <i>Hyenas</i> could be read as a simple parable about political corruption, but it's far too strange to be reduced to that. Stylistically and visually, it's reminiscent of the Garca Mrquez-inspired film <i>Erendira</i> - there's the same sense of heightened unreality and (dare one say it?) magic realism. Set in a small village which mysteriously blossoms into a metropolis (i.e. it's set nowhere), it's the story of a local notary shunted into the moral front line when the town is visited by one of its daughters made good - the now omnipotent <i>grande dame</i> Linguere. Director Mambty displays a slightly cruel comic touch as he manipulates his cast of fools and avenging deities in what seems like Africa's equivalent of a Krazy Kat landscape. Not quite fascinating, but more than intriguing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Miss Giddens (Deborah Kerr) isnt a very experienced governess so she cant be certain, but surely orphans Miles (Martin Stephens) and Flora (Pamela Franklin) arent like other children. Theyre polite, of course, to the point of being patronising (my dear, they call her), and their dark, placid eyes defy suspicion, but theres something unsettling in his self-possession, macabre in her delights (Oh, look, a lovely spider. And its eating a butterfly!). Having already experienced weird apparitions on her arrival at Bly, the beautiful country estate to which the childrens indifferent uncle has consigned them, the governess learns of the violent deaths of her wanton predecessor and her cruel lover, and begins to suspect a supernatural cause for her charges unsettling behaviour. And so Miss Giddens war on terror begins; but does Bly have nothing to fear but fear itself?<br />Adapted (by Truman Capote and John Mortimer, among others) from Henry Jamess The Turn of the Screw, Jack Claytons 1961 chiller lives up to the storys title, incrementally tightening the nerves through suggestive technical artistry in a way that few contemporary ghost stories manage. The storys profound, unsettling ambiguity is perfectly served by Georges Aurics soundtrack of laughs and whispers and the constricting or fleeting forms at the edges of Freddie Franciss B&amp;W Scope frame (seen here in a new print). Meanwhile, slow fades and a bravura dream sequence hint at the blurring of boundaries  between life and death, rationality and imagination  that so disturbs Miss Giddens, endowed by Kerr with a frisson of hysteria from the start. Whatever is happening, she knows it is something secretive and whispery and indecent.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Though it lacks the awesome allegorical ambiguousness of the 1956 classic of sci-fi/political paranoia (here paid homage in cameo appearances by Kevin McCarthy and Don Siegel), Kaufman and screenwriter WD Richter's update and San Francisco transposition of Jack Finney's novel is a far from redundant remake. The extraterrestrial pod people now erupt into a world where seemingly everyone is already 'into' changing their lives or lifestyles, and into a cinematic landscape already criss-crossed by an endless series of conspiracies, while the movie has as much fun toying with modern thought systems (psychology, ecology) as with elaborate variations on its predecessor. Kaufman here turns in his most Movie Brattish film, but soft-pedals on both his special effects and knowing in-jokiness in a way that puts De Palma to shame; even extra bit appearances by Robert Duvall (Kaufman's Jesse James in <i>The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid</i>) and Hollywood archivist Tom Luddy are given a nicely take-it-or-leave-it dimension.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Arguably the finest of Hitchcock's silent films, this tale of a fairground boxer (Brisson) whose wife takes a shine to the far more socially sophisticated new champion (Hunter), sees the young director completely confident in his control of the medium. The title is ambivalent, referring not only to the boxing-ring (scene of Brisson's first humiliation), to the wedding-ring and to the bracelet Hunter secretly gives to his rival's wife, but also to the circular shape of the story, which stresses the philanderer's apathy when his adulterous affair comes to nothing. Impressive, too, is Hitchcock's keen eye for social detail, and his command of expressionist visual devices to suggest his characters' states of mind, perhaps most memorably a shot which 'melts' off the screen to evoke the cuckold's drunken slide into oblivion.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Costa-Gavras' crowd-pleasing left wing thriller was based on the 1965 Lambrakis affair, in which investigation of the accidental death of a medical professor uncovered a network of police and government corruption. As Greece was under the Colonels at the time, the film was shot in Algeria, with a script by Spaniard Jorge Semprun and music by Theodorakis. The recreation of the murder and the subsequent investigation uses the techniques of an American thriller to gripping effect, though conspiracies are so commonplace nowadays that it's hard to imagine the impact it made at the time.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[First-time director Esther Robinson proves that a dash of subjectivity in documentary isnt always a bad thing, showing a remarkable clarity of vision and thirst for knowledge in her superb A Walk Into the Sea: Danny Williams and the Warhol Factory. It tells the story of her late uncle, artist, technician, filmmaker and Warholite Danny Williams, whose creative output was cut drastically short due to his strange disappearance in 1966 at the age of 27. At once an affecting trawl through Robinsons family archive and a jaw-droppingly frank social fresco of the people, places and practices of Warhols Factory, the director draws a series of lively interviews from her subjects (Ron Nameth, John Cale, Paul Morrissey et al) and, in the process, says as much about the erratic nature of oral history as she does the plight of her uncle. The film also features one of Williamss own angular (and highly accomplished) 16mm shorts.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival<br /></i><br />Oliver Stone is back on the trading floor and Michael Douglas is back in the sharp suits for Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, an undisciplined attempt by the director of JFK and W. at resurrecting his 1980s tale for modern times and combining melodrama with up-to-the-minute social and economic commentary. The characterisations are so broad and the plotting so wild that this revival, which is screening out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival, is best viewed as a camp comedy and a knowing in-joke  albeit one that feels the need to plant economics lectures in the mouths of its cast so that it at least sounds like a serious attempt to take the pulse of our times.<br />Jacob (Shia LaBeouf) is a mindful and smart young trader at a Wall Street bank, where he enjoys the support and mentorship of a banking boss of the old school (Frank Langella) and is on the verge of ploughing money into an eco-business hes identified as a safe, responsible investment. But the good vibes cant last. Theres a crash and an aggressive takeover by rival banking boss Bretton James (Josh Brolin, all cigars and motorbikes) sends his mentor tumbling onto the subway tracks and Jacob into Brettons more mercenary hands. The other hitch is that Jacobs leftie girlfriend is Winnie Gekko (Carey Mulligan), estranged daughter of Gordon (Michael Douglas), whos on his way out of jail and not necessarily the reformed character he might appear.<br />There are so many nods to the first movie and weak gags in Stones opportunistic resurrection of his 1987 film that its impossible to take seriously the films attempt to capture the financial zeitgeist. Right from the minute Gekko walks out of prison at the beginning of the film and retrieves an empty money clip and a huge mobile phone from the prison authorities, you know this is going to be an odd mix of a picture, half<br />panto, half drama. You want to shout Behind you! whenever a cigar-chomping, shiny-headed bad banker appears. Brolins Bretton is particularly wide: he owns a grim Goya painting and you expect him to grow horns and start cackling in front of it. <br />LaBeouf is fine as the films calm conscience and Douglas, too, is an amusing presence, not too broad and obviously enjoying himself. The cameos lighten the mood even more: Charlie Sheen pops up as Bud Fox from the first film; Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter plays himself in an especially odd scene; and Stone himself twice rears his head disastrously. Mulligan comes out of the whole thing poorly: her character is a bit of a sourpuss and even though were supposed to feel empathy for her and her values, the film slyly sidelines her as a little too dull for its liking.<br />The style is brash and obvious, as is often Stones habit: when someone tells Jacob, Youve got fight in you!, we actually see the ghost of Langella in his mirror; when Jacob starts talking about the hydrogen-power firm he wants to support, we see all sorts of crass graphics and kids-TV science experiments flashing up on screen.<br />Stones lightweight and soapy film feels like he threw a whole load of newspaper clippings at a tired plot about estranged fathers and a clash of values. The problem with this film is that if you put in front of a bunch of bankers, theyd laugh their heads off and feel a swell of pride at the thought that they inhabit a world as glamorous as that suggested by Stones indulging of the New York skyline and the trappings of excessive wealth. Its hardly satire. This is a pulp novelisation of the banking crisis and its pleas for relevance ring very hollow.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival<br /></i><br />At last years Cannes film festival, South Korean writer and filmmaker Lee Chang-Dong was on the main competition jury; the previous year his Secret Sunshine won the best actress prize in the official selection, and back in 2000 his second feature, Peppermint Candy, made a splash in the Directors Fortnight. Yet hes never had a film released in the UK; given that his latest, Poetry, is  at least in this writers opinion  even better than Secret Sunshine, one hopes that that situation may change.<br />The films story is simple. In her mid-sixties, Mija lives with her teenage grandson in a small town (her daughter works and lives in Pusan). Shes still elegant, even fashionable, and had her fair share of admirers in the past, but now she works as a part-time helper for an elderly man whos had a stroke and fills her remaining hours by visiting poetry classes and trying to summon up enough confidence to write a spot of verse herself. Her teacher advises her to seek out beauty, but life most definitely isnt that simple<br />Lees movie counterpoints Mijas curiosity, courage and generosity with the injustice, cruelty and complexity of the world she lives in, and does so to witty, affecting and very intelligent effect. Wisely, he steers clear of sentimentality  Mija is too firm and feisty a character to allow for that  and in this regard he is admirably served by a wonderful lead performance by Yun Junghee as Mija; sadly, its hard to imagine a British film focussing on such an elderly protagonist, let alone carrying it off so persuasively. But Lee gets things gloriously right, and Poetry is undoubtedly one of the best films in this years official competition.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival</i><br />French filmmaker Xavier Beauvoiss fifth feature is an observational and philosophical drama, based on true events from 1996, about a group of eight French monks in Algeria's Atlas mountains who face a growing threat of violence from armed Islamic fundamentalists operating in the region.<br />The film concerns itself with the monks deliberations, practical and spiritual, as to whether or not they men should stay in their monastery at this dangerous time, tending to the medical and other needs of the local community, or whether they should return to<br />France. But Beauvois is equally interested in the rituals and routines of this remote commune, asking why these ageing men choose to live this way and examining the odd sort of communality they achieve by facing up to this unusual challenge.<br />Beauvois rallies an astounding ensemble cast for this enquiring work, which is strangely serene in mood considering the violence and the threats of violence at its heart. From the off, we know were dealing with a nuanced, humane study of religions and the motives and beliefs of their stewards: early on we witness a friendly and serious discussion between the monks and local imams about Islamic fundamentalism and attitudes to Islam. Even when a group of mujahedin appear at the monastery, and not long after weve witnessed them slitting the throats of Croatian workers, Beauvois is careful to present them in a balanced, understanding fashion. Its debate he is after rather than judgement and certainly not any sort of thrill from the threat faced by the monks. This is a film about piety rather than peril.<br />What sticks in the mind most about Of Gods and Men is the journey we witness these eight monks taking from initially disagreeing among themselves as to whether or not to leave the monastery to finally almost unanimously agreeing as to their fate. We come to understand that their beliefs and the succour they take from each other may be more potent than even they first believed, and while Beauvois is in no way suggesting that they are martyrs, he does imply that they have found a spiritual solution to impending death.<br />Thats not to say their mortal quandary doesnt scare the hell out of these men, as it would anybody, monks or not. This predicament is made powerfully and movingly clear in a heartrending scene where the monks listen to music from Tchaikovskys Swan Lake and we witness a series of close-ups of their faces and eyes, the latter invariably filling with tears.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Germano shared the Best Actor prize at Cannes for his lead turn in this amiable but confused drama  something like a lightweight Ken Loach film  as Claudio, a young, working-class husband and father who toils on a building site on the edge of Rome. The films early scenes are at pains to describe what a happy life Claudio and his pregnant wife Elena (Ragonese) share with their two young children and various friends and family  so much so that you know something terrible must be imminent. But when it comes it fatally splinters the drama so that we end up with an odd mix of tragedy, comedy and romance as Germano rebuilds his life, puts renewed energy into his work by persuading a property magnate to give him a contract and discovers that his new friendship with a Romanian woman and her son conflicts awkwardly with a skeleton in his cupboard at work. You sense the director is trying to say something about the individualism of modern Italy and new support structures away from the traditional family, but most ideas are buried beneath sentiment and slapdash storytelling, even if the film has an attractive, documentary-style visual energy.<br />]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[Outside the Law]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival</i><br />Rachid Boucharebs Outside the Law (Hors-La-Loi) is a fierce historical tale with Jean-Pierre Melvilles 1969 resistance film Army of the Shadows written all over it. Even more sweeping and provocative than his 2006 film Days of Glory, which honoured the contribution of North African troops to the liberation of France in 1944, Boucharebs latest film is a fictionalisation of the origins and campaign of Algerias National Liberation Front (FLN), the movement that waged a campaign of violence in France and Algeria in the run-up to the countrys independence in 1962. Its a big and bold film and one whose reserved passion and stately style sweeps you along with it.<br />The background of Outside the Law may be historical - we move from 1925 to 1962 over the films two-and-a-bit hours - but Bouchareb adopts a strident perspective by inventing the characters of three Algerian brothers, who we first meet as theyre thrown off their land as children in the 1920s. We jump to May 1945, when on the same day as France was celebrating the end of war, a conflict broke out between police and protestors in the Algerian town of Stif, leading thousands of deaths. Boucharebs argument is that this was a colonial massacre - we watch as scores of men are gunned down in the streets  although this episode has caused the most amount of debate prior to films Cannes screening, with some arguing that Bouchareb has laid the blame for deaths too squarely on the French authorities. Whether or not Boucharebs emphasis is skewed, surely the point is that it was events such as these in Stif that politicised young men who would later become armed underground fighters? If the perception was of a massacre rather than something more nuanced, thats a valid perspective for the film to take in describing the development of its characters.<br />Among the chaos at Stif, we again meet Sad (Jamel Debbouze), Messaoud (Roschdy Zem) and Abdelkader (Sami Bouajila), now adults and living in the town with their mother. Time moves on again and the family is fractured: Sad moves to Paris with his mother, moving into a shanty town in Nanterre and earning a living on the shady streets of Pigalle; Abdelkader is arrested in Algeria and ends up in a French jail; and Messaoud goes off to fight for France in Indochina.<br />The film takes flight and fully enters Melville territory in the late 1950s, when we settle into a period when Abdelkader becomes a leader in the Paris branch of the FLN, Messaoud joins his brother in the resistance movement and the less political Sad graduates from running prostitutes to running his own cabaret club and promoting boxing fights. Its the cold lack of glamour of Melvilles 1969 film about the French resistance that Bouchareb successfully co-opts as Abdelkader becomes a steely underground operator, prepared to turn on other Algerians  and perhaps even his family  if its for the good of the movement. The tone is sweeping and epic. The effect is to tie these brothers experiences into the wider French-Algerian experience of men co-opted by colonialism but treated as an underclass both in Algeria and France and pushed to violent extremes at a time when traditional politics was failing them.<br />Boucharebs aim is to shed light on the individual passions, conflicts and backgrounds behind the collective action of the FLN and his invention of these three brothers offers a very successful way of encapsulating a variety of experience. In French political terms, Bouchareb is striving to reclaim the work of the FLN as a movement as honourable and as necessary as the wartime resistance, which is why his referencing of Army of the Shadows is more than a stylistic choice: its a plea for the Algerian experience to be seen in a similar context and for the FLNs agents to be acknowledged as facing personal choices just as tough and conflicted yet vital as anyone who fought in the resistance.<br />As a thriller and drama, its a marked improvement on Days of Glory. The performances are terrific (topped by Bouajila as Abdelkader) and the dialogue manages to encapsulate various debates without feeling preachy or false. Its an impressive achievement as an engaged entertainment and a powerful rallying cry for a nation to think more deeply about its colonial past and the ancestry of many of its citizens.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Neds is the 50-year-old Scottish actor Peter Mullans third feature as a writer and director and returns him to the time and place where he grew up: Glasgow in the early 1970s. The title stands for Non-Educated Delinquents, which hints at the same authorial anger towards institutional brutality and bureaucracy that characterised Mullans last film, The Magdalene Sisters, which told of the horror of Irelands church-run homes for young fallen women in the 1960s. This time, Mullan has in his sights a society that fails a fictional young boy whose entire background  his family, friends, class, school  conspire to threaten his early promise. Its not autobiographical, but the rage and compassion at its core suggest its a story very close to Mullans heart.<br />The boy is John McGill (played at different ages by Gregg Forrest and Conor McCarron), a studious and religious child who we meet as hes about to start secondary school, where he fully expects to continue his successful career. It doesn't take long for reality to hit home. John is aghast when he finds himself dumped in the second stream and astonished when the teacher shows little interest and not a little menace when he tries to discuss the matter reasonably. The mood in the school is aggressive and stifling. Mullan plays with its absurdity: some of the teachers are black comic figures.<br />We realise quickly just how much the cards are stacked against John. As in The Magdalene Sisters, this community crushes individual spirit. Class tension and fear means that John is not able to maintain a friendship with a local middle-class lad, Julian (Martin Bell), whose parents take against his less refined friend. Johns often-absent elder brother already has a reputation at the school and with local police as a hard man; his father (played hauntingly by Mullan himself) is a silent, violent soak; his mother is an oppressed and abused figure, in contrast to his easy-going aunt who visits from America; and most of his teachers are unhelpful and powerless when it comes to the violent, territorial gang culture which has spread from the local housing estates to the playground. We talk in 2010 of a knife culture, but here it is in 1970s Scotland, where the blade is a constant teenage threat. <br />Its a brutal film, the no-nonsense realism of which reminds you of Ken Loach or Alan Clarke but which is tempered and challenged by daring moments of fantasy which hint at the imagination and release of the likes of Lindsay Andersons If. If I told you that there were scenes involving lions and Jesus stepping down off the cross, you'd find it hard to imagine where they fit in, and so it should be. They surprise, they lift you out of the oppressiveness of most of the story and they suggest hope through imagination and strength. <br />Mostly, though, 'Neds' feels authentic: the period details are clear but never over-defined, and the location shooting and the casting of local people, discovered through open auditions, gives the film a sickeningly believable edge. Its not a polished film. Its a little messy in structure, and overlong, but it hits home hard its smart and sensitive points about childhood, opportunities and the lack of them. Once again, Mullan has made a suffocating film about the powerless trapped by their destiny, helped by next to nobody.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Returning home to his mum, teenage sister and little brother after two years in a psychiatric clinic, nine-year-old Abel had better display some kind of normality or heâll be sent, perhaps for good, to a kids hospital in Mexico City. Suddenly he starts speaking again â albeit acting as if heâs his fatherâ¦ Diego Lunaâs first fiction feature confirms the promise of his boxing doc âChÃ¡vezâ; though the parallel plotting towards the end is a bit clumsy, he tells the story swiftly and clearly, shifts smoothly between serious scenes and comedy, elicits good performances, and knows how to use Scope. An engrossing, surprisingly unsentimental study of a kid whose behaviour is both a consequence of and a catalyst for family tensions fuelled by outmoded notions of masculinity.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Weâve had football movies, boxing movies and Formula One movies, but the time-honoured sports picture takes a turn for the quaint, as we delve into the back-stabbing world of competitive jigsaw puzzles. MarÃ­a Onetto â last seen wowing in Lucrecia Martelâs âThe Headless Womanâ â is the dawdling, softly spoken housewife, cook and keeper of her swarthy hubby and needy brood of teenage sons. That is until she receives a jigsaw puzzle for her birthday and, discovering a dormant talent for completing them at great speed, contacts wealthy cad and speed-jigsaw scenester, Roberto (Arturo Goetz), and their practice sessions start to generate a romantic spark. Itâs a lovely little movie up until the point (about an hour in) where you realise that director Natalia Smifnoffâs ambition is strictly limited to making a neat, run-of-the-mill genre film that fits together all too neatly.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A very fertile conceit â the film both gradually brings together and rhymes the skills and experiences of two very different disenchanted individuals whose work might be seen as therapeutic (a psychoanalyst with a troubled marriage, and a high-class prostitute who specialises in role-playing) â is given real substance by Isabelle Huppertâs predictably superb turn as the call-girl considering calling it a day. Lent strong support by Bouli Lanners as the morose shrink, she wrings each and every subtle nuance out of a character that in other hands might have slipped into caricature â though whether (pace the LFF bookletâs claims) the film also serves as a commentary on Huppertâs own career is another matter entirely. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This bold first feature from Ukrainian documentary-maker Loznitsa (the only debut in the Cannes competition) revolves around a nightmarish road trip and combines a realist visual style with a mode of storytelling that moves disconcertingly between past and present and invites us to get lost in a maze of cause and effect. Georgy (Nemets) is a truckdriver on a job in rural Russia. He encounters a Kafka-esque police road block, a prostitute who reacts badly to his kindness and a war veteran who appears in his cab and whose anecdotes take us back to his return from the German front as a young soldier in 1946. When Georgy takes a turning off the road and shares a meal with tramps, he finds himself stuck in a brutal, lawless village, a place we see both now and in some unspecified time in the past. There are hints of Tarkovsky in the poetic exploration of place and memory and the film is a demanding, difficult work. But the sense of a Dantean journey and a vision of utter hell are powerfully conveyed. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[With her divisive 2007 debut, The Unpolished, it was hard to tell whether German director Pia Marais was in control of the anarchic visuals she hurled at the lens of her probing camera. This expertly controlled second film suggests that she was. It's a coolly precise study of the vicissitudes of middle age in which a capricious air hostess (Jeanne Balibar, giving a muted but expressive performance) decides to dip her toe into the murky ocean of animal rights. Tough, dispassionate but also amusing and honest, it's only when the final credits roll that you realise this is a film dealing in ideas and provocations rather than pandering to cosy dramatic convention, and its all the more intriguing for it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This domestic drama from Danish director Pernille Fischer Christensen is as disappointingly generic as its title, albeit with a pair of classy central performances. Lene Maria Christensen plays Copenhagen gallery curator Ditte whoâs offered a job in New York on the same day that she finds out sheâs pregnant. The news that her beloved father Rikard (Jesper Christensen) has inoperable cancer only complicates Ditteâs decisions about her future. This father-daughter relationship, with all its joys and difficulties, is explored in an intense and emotional way, so much so that all the other characters â Ditteâs boyfriend, Rikardâs wife and three other children â are too sketchily drawn.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Although tender and likeable, Wang Xiaoshuais film about Lin (Wang Xueqi), a middle-aged man who returns to Chongqing after 14 years at sea, is less of a mystery than its copious flashbacks suggest. Lin wants to know why his teenage son (Zi Yi) was shot dead by the police after taking a woman hostage in a supermarket (a timely story after recent school shootings in China). His ex-wife doesnt want to know him, but Lin reconstructs his sons absence through conversations with an old friend and with those who knew the boy, including an ex-girlfriend who may have triggered his trauma. Flashbacks to events in the supermarket begin to fill in gaps, but the real interest of the story is not in discovering what happened, but in exploring the themes of disconnection and reconnection between people and places. In the ether are ideas about the generation gap and those being left behind by Chinas development  ideas illustrated evocatively by striking shots of Chongqing in a blue mist. A solid, good-looking film, but also one that in the end feels oddly academic.]]></review>

Jean-Franois Caissy's bleak fly-on-the-wall illustration of life in its final stages has no narration and no musical soundtrack. Rather, were invited simply to sit and watch as the homes frail guests sit motionless in chairs, play board games or visit the in-house doctor. Caissy shoots his film in often frustratingly long takes. Its as if hes insisting we slow our own lives down in order to empathise with those of the homes bored, listless, forgotten folk. Its a commendable subject alright but very hard going.]]></review>

The first concerns a young filmmaker, Jingu, who at a post-screening Q&amp;A finds himself embarrassed at being questioned about his irresponsible actions in an earlier affair; the other three shift backwards in time to the relationship in question, shedding light not only on the involvement of another older man but, finally, on the perceptions of Oki, the film student to whom the men are attracted. Ambiguities and ironies abound in a characteristically wry, witty, prismatic tale which, notwithstanding Hongs purloining of Elgar, may very well be about hope but has little to do with glory.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Theres much to admire in Paul Andrew Williamss low-budget debut feature, not least the genuine empathy with which he approaches the reality of homelessness and child prostitution. It opens with a jolt at 3.07am, somewhere in London:  Kelly (Lorraine Stanley), a young woman with a swollen eye, bursts through a toilet door to join Joanne (Georgia Groome), her pre-teen companion, whos shaking with fear. Soon theyre on a train to Brighton, but not before Kelly turns a trick to raise the fare. Meanwhile, sad-sack pimp Derek (Johnny Harris) is taking instructions from Stuart (Sam Spruell), a quiet-spoken, middle-class gangster-figure, whos aggrieved about an accident thats befallen his father and wants the two girls caught pronto (an instruction he delivers with a knife-strike to Dereks thigh). . .<br />On one level, Williamss film is a tender, human and convincing portrait of an ugly world. Intimate scenes with Kelly and Joanne are smartly written, acted and directed so as to explore the uncomfortable conflict between Joannes desperate inexperience and the hard-nosed maturity and sexual nous needed to survive the streets (Ive never worn make-up before, says 11-year-old Joanne en route to a midnight tryst with an old man). But while Williams has one eye firmly on the real world, he has the other on Planet Film, from where Stuart and his henchmen have clearly caught the early train. After a promising start, the film becomes less about the experience of an archetypal runaway and more about exploiting terror for big-screen thrills. The further London to Brighton enters the realm of the extreme, with nighttime assassinations and at least one character straight out of Performance, the less it feels like its saying anything at all.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Originally refused an export licence, Paradjanov's extraordinary film traces the life of 18th century Armenian poet Sayat Nova ('The King of Song'), but with a series of painterly images strung together to form tableaux corresponding to moments of his life rather than any conventional biographic techniques. Pomegranates bleed their juice into the shape of a map of the old region of Armenia, the poet changes sex at least once in the course of his career, angels descend: the result is a stream of religious, poetic and local iconography which has an arcane and astonishing beauty. Much of its meaning must remain essentially specific to the culture from which the film springs, and no one could pretend that it's all readily accessible, but audiences accustomed to the work of Tarkovsky should have little problem.

      <review><![CDATA[First production from Island Pictures, whose parent record company did so much to introduce reggae to a white audience, but <i>The Harder They Come</i> it ain't. An underworked script by writer/director Jobson has Countryman, a Jamaican village fisherman, rescuing two Americans whose small plane has crashed, then sheltering them as they become the quarry of a national man-hunt conducted to disgrace the opposition party during a national election. Unfortunately, the film never works out its political confusions. But even more problematic are the supernatural powers with which its innocent protagonist is endowed, probably the sticking point for wide audience acceptance. An excellent sampler-style soundtrack - Marley, Toots, Scratch Perry, Aswad - isn't enough to paper over the deficiencies. Nor is the film's superbly lush landscape cinematography.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Paul Taylors remarkable documentary has a familiar narrative arc, following as it does the preparations, recording sessions and  ever postponed  final big gig of an amateur choir from Aids/HIV-ravaged South African province of KwaZulu-Natal. <br />His resolutely non-sentimental, carefully balanced, edited and photographed movie, three years in the making, had its roots in a fund-raising mission for the choristers orphanage. But he transcends his brief by virtue of his patient, sensitive interviewing style and the evident trust he builds up, providing an intimate portrait of the textures and rhythms of extended-family life (that of the Moya family) in the crisis-ridden South Africa hinterlands. <br />Most remarkable is the raw emotion he captures, noticeably in a series of close-ups of the resourceful young orphans themselves, whose faces sing with feeling as much as their voices. This sympathy and attention, incidentally, brings out something more universal: the fundamental role music plays for people in ritual, communication, celebration and the assimilation of pain and suffering. A very moving film.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This thoroughly modern family portrait, which became the summers sleeper indie hit in the US, is a perfectly balanced combination of comical episodes and subtle gestures, sharp one-liners and effortlessly naturalistic dialogue. Julianne Moore and Annette Bening play a middle-aged couple whose teenage children Joni (Mia Wasikowska from Alice in Wonderland) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson) go looking for the sperm-doner their mums used to get pregnant (Ruffalo). His arrival disrupts the family's lives and sparks each character to contemplate what it means to grow up or grow old. But this isnt just another film where life lessons are learned and they all live happily ever after. Writer-director Lisa Cholodenko (High Art, Laurel Canyon) knows that real life is messier than that, but her empathy and lightness of touch ensure this wonderfully realistic film is both deeply affecting and riotously funny.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Losey's adaptation of LP Hartley's novel is one of his more impressive later works. Together with screenwriter Harold Pinter, he creates another of his depictions of the destructive side of the English class system, as a love affair between the daughter of an affluent country family and a local farmer is tragically thwarted by prejudice and convention. Seen through the eyes of a young boy who acts as the instrument for the couple's assignations, the affair becomes the nexus for all the repression and unspoken manipulations brewing under the polite facade of an apparently civilised society; battle becomes personal on the cricket field, and the chink of teacups hides vicious whispers and plotting. It occasionally becomes a bit too precious, especially with the inserts of the grown-up go-between visiting his past haunts, but it's strong on atmosphere (the Norfolk locations are beautifully shot by Gerry Fisher), performance and moral nuance.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Renowned for its Isaac Hayes score, and as the first mainstream, commercially successful film about a black private eye, Parks' film is a hip, cool, entertaining thriller that in fact never really says very much at all about the Black experience in America; rather, it merely takes the traditional crime-fighting hero, paints him black, and sets him down in a world populated by more blacks than Hollywood movies were used to. Roundtree turns in a strong performance, investigating a racketeer's criminal activities, while at the same time trying to find the man's kidnapped daughter.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When a teenage girl is murdered in a small Alaskan town, Will Dormer (Pacino) and his LAPD partner Hap (Donovan) are sent to investigate. To Ellie (Swank), the rookie assigned to assist the veteran detective, Dormer's a hero. But she doesn't know Internal Affairs is keeping an eye on him. Then a disastrous stakeout leaves Dormer guilty and fearful for his liberty. Worse, he starts receiving blackmail calls from crime novelist and prime suspect Walter Finch (Williams). The midnight sun, meanwhile, is depriving Dormer of sleep, clouding his judgment. If all this may sound familiar, it's because Hillary Seitz's subtle script improves on the 1997 Norwegian thriller of the same name. Despite its linear storyline, the film is very recognisably the work of the sharp, probing intelligence that gave us <i>Following</i> and <i>Memento</i>. While it succeeds as an extremely stylish, gripping thriller, it's also another of the director's takes on 'life as narrative'. Dormer's dealings with Hap and Finch are about who can come up with a story others will swallow. The better your tale, the greater your control. Poor Dormer, however, disoriented in every sense, no longer distinguishes so clearly between means and motive, cause and effect. This, like the uniformly terrific acting (especially from Pacino and Williams), lends welcome nuance and depth to the ethical enquiry while furnishing the drama with dark, telling ironies and intriguing ambiguity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Woody Allen is always weakest when nostalgic: indulgence leads to caricature and overstatement. Set at the start of World War II, the film follows the fortunes of a family of Jewish underachievers. Against the backdrop of their predictably colourful obsessions, a glimmer of a story charts the progress of Farrow from Manhattan nightclub cigarette-girl to celeb of the airwaves. The real star, however, is radio itself, that pre-TV purveyor of everyday unreality against which wartime America measured its dreams. It's a great idea for a movie, but Allen fatally opts for a <i>Fellini: Amarcord</i> approach of formless narrative, larger-than-life coincidence, and rambling ruminations on what times there used to be.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hard on the heels of David Lean's grandiose, touristic version of EM Forster's <i>A Passage to India</i>, the Merchant/Ivory/Jhabvala team get the scale of Forster's vision down to its right size. The story of the awakening of young Lucy (Bonham Carter), thanks to the liberating effect of the Tuscan countryside and the Latin temperament, is translated with perfect judgment, with the only lapses occurring over Forster's wry sense of humour. His satiric judgments can too often become arch: the 'grotesquely' illustrated intertitles here are a miscalculation of this order. None the less, in line with Forster's dicta on 'fully rounded characters', there is a fine gallery here; and the 'tea tabling' effect of the Home Counties upon grand emotion, from an era when dynastic families could topple over a single kiss, is mapped out with perfect precision. Decent, honest, truthful and, dearest of all to Forster, it connects. CPea.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This charming documentary on innocence and image-making from that venerable Northern Irish critic/filmmaker Mark Cousins offers rich insights into how we produce and consume cinema. Referencing Dennis Hoppers acid-fried deconstruction of the filmmaking process, The Last Movie (1971), in its title, Cousins follows in the trail of the late wild man to the war-ravaged rural border town of Goptapa in Kurdish Iraq, where he screens magical realist movies in the local square and hands out digital cameras to children to see what stories they invent. Though Cousins tries to push a thesis about the perplexing interconnectivity between war and cinema, what he achieves is far purer, a lyrical essay on the relationship between youth and the recorded image. Moreover, his film  like Abbas Kiarostamis Homework or ABC Africa  chronicles how people create roles for themselves when bathed in the cameras gaze.<br />Cousins excitedly discovers that one lad has a keen cinematic eye, and this childs footage comes close to the critics own ideas of how good directors use a camera as a machine for empathy. His vignette  The Boy and the Mud  sees a boy playing with mud in a ditch as he has no friends, and Cousins touts it as the first masterpiece of a director who is destined to make waves in the future. As ever, Cousinss lilting, urgent narration is up there with the dry, Teutonic stylings of Werner Herzog for pure listening pleasure.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Theres a moral here: never bribe a ski-lift operator to let you have one last run before sundown. Its the end of their weekend break and three students are heading for a final session when their ski chair comes to a halt, leaving the trio dangling 40 feet above hard-packed snow. At first their banter is cheerful, and theyre confident that someone will spot them. But once night draws in, the lights go out, the temperature falls and a series of eerie howls are heard echoing through the valley, their jokey demeanour morphs into chilled fear. Unless someone takes the plunge, all three will remain in a state of suspended animation.<br />Adam Greens taut, toe-curling survival thriller is better than it should be: the concept and the characters behaviour are mostly plausible, the script is dark and funny, the acting is adequate, and the wildlife scenes are convincing. Sure, we can nitpick about continuity and tapered endings, but as low-key, low-budget filmmaking, Frozen is a minor success.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The urge for up-and-coming Hollywood pretty boys to prove their dramatic chops has led to bizarre career U-turns for everyone from Jerry Lewis to Ashton Kutcher, and now itâs the turn of newly minted A-lister Ryan Reynolds, who filled in time between flirting with Sandra Bullock in âThe Proposalâ and slipping on the emerald tights for forthcoming superhero epic âGreen Lanternâ by making an entire movie in a seven-by-three-foot box.<br />Reynolds plays Paul Conroy, a US contractor ambushed in Iraq who wakes to find himself six feet underground with only a cellphone and a Zippo. Itâs an intriguing set-up, and the early scenes are superbly clammy as Paul deals first with his gruff Iraqi kidnappers and then with the infuriatingly sceptical US authorities, all the while keeping an eye on his dwindling air supply.<br />But writer-director Rodrigo CortÃ©s struggles to maintain the tension, and his desire to appeal to the multiplex crowd leads to some bizarre, incongruous episodes: the sudden appearance of a snake is more laughable than terrifying, while Paulâs teary, Oscar-bait farewell to his geriatric mum feels heavy handed. If CortÃ©s had dialled back the narrative intrigue and audience manipulation in favour of a more grimly realistic approach, âBuriedâ could have been a bona fide, claustrophobic classic. As it is, this is a solid, unsettling, at times very entertaining thriller â but the juryâs still out on Reynolds.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Nick Morans second feature  his first was a biopic of Telstar producer Joe Meek  is another remarkable true story. His latest subject is British author Kevin Lewis (Rupert Friend), who published his life story and worked with Moran and Triggermen writer Mark Thomas on the screenplay. The film opens with a series of young actors playing out shocking scenes of Lewiss deprived childhood. Life looks up when he finds kind foster parents and a job, but theres always a crook around the corner ready to exploit his naivety. <br />While the childhood scenes are affecting, The Kid loses its sense of direction when Lewis reaches adulthood. Like Telstar, this fails to dig deep into its protagonists emotions  in fact, it barely touches the surface, merely relating events in a plodding fashion. Friend is fine, but a prosthetically altered Natascha McElhone overplays it as Lewiss monstrous mother  it would be comical, if the story wasnt so depressing. Wheres a more convincing actress when you need one? In short, this is an inspiring story, but its badly told. Best read the book instead.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Autopsy director Adam Gieraschs affectionate remake of Kevin Tenneys 1988 straight-to-video movie is less campy and more coherent than the cult original. Tenneys movie was mainly notable for the scene in which Scream Queen Linnea Quigley inserted a lipstick into her nipple  a moment tastefully reprised here. After the police shut down a Halloween night party, only the hostess, Angela (Shannon Elizabeth) and six guests remain at the mansion where, 85 years before, six guests vanished and the owner hanged herself after summoning demons. Now Angela has been possessed, and unless the other half-dozen can survive until dawn, these demons will escape into the world. Majoring on blood, breasts and rock n roll, this is fanboy horror featuring demons that are sexy as well as scary. In the original, the action took place in an abandoned funeral parlour, where the owner used to touch up the corpses to make them look good for their loved ones; this feels similar.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[With a characteristic mix of narrative anarchy, cinephile allusion, cartoon-style slapstick and black-tinged comedy, Dante gleefully sinks his teeth into the kind of fluffy, sugary, sickly small town fantasy beloved of his pal and sometime producer Spielberg. It starts with a Christmas gift - a cute, cuddly little 'mogwai' - but the time of goodwill soon turns hellish when, splashed with water, the creature starts sprouting the titular monsters, whose sense of mischief extends to the murderous and beyond. As the all-American township falls prey to the little demons' destructive urges, Dante lets rip with fabulous special effects, hilariously sadistic set-pieces (most memorably the monsters wreaking havoc at a screening of Disney's <i>Snow White</i>) and in-jokes galore, all delivered at such a heady pace that the trashing of traditional American values and consumer goods even feels quite liberating.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ever since his brother's death, seedy gumshoe Eddie Valiant (Hoskins) has hated Toons - the animated inhabitants of the '40s LA suburb of Toontown, most of whom make a living appearing in Hollywood cartoons. But when studio head Marvin Acme asks him to check up on the extra-marital activities of Jessica Rabbit, the humanoid, torch-singing, Toon spouse of our eponymous stunt-Toon hero, Eddie finds himself up to his fedora in murder, blackmail, and conspiracy. Zemeckis and animation director Richard Williams' comedy-thriller blends live action, Warners-style animation, and a typically tortuous film <i>noir</i> plot to delirious effect. Virtually faultless on the technological front, it also excels in terms of a breathless, wisecracking script, deft characterisation (both human and Toon), and rousing action. At its best, the humour is as cruel, violent, and surreal as vintage Chuck Jones. Supremely entertaining - especially for adults.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In the future, geneticists will design test-tube babies to be disease-free. Physical perfection will become the norm, and those flawed specimens born the old-fashioned way will form the new underclass - the 'in-valids'. Vincent Freeman (Hawke), an in-valid with a heart defect, is only taken seriously in the powerful Gattaca space programme when he assumes the identity of Jerome (Law), a 'valid' who supplies blood, tissue and urine samples in return for shelter (he himself having been crippled in a car accident). The subterfuge is successful - until a murder draws unwelcome scrutiny from the authorities. Self-consciously at a remove from the trashy B-movie sensibilities which have dominated science-fantasy movies in recent times, this harks back to the vacuum-packed, classically alienated dystopia of <i>Brave New World</i> and <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>. Chilly, elegant, and a little bloodless.]]></review>

Dealing with a trio of sky-divers who for a variety of reasons are growing ambivalent about their 'careers', and the inhabitants of a small town who feel both threatened and attracted to the parachutists, the film manages to catch equally well the quiet desperation of small town life and the growing disillusionment of incessant travellers in search of glamour. The performances by Lancaster, Kerr and Hackman are superb.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Though very much a two-hander and marred by the restraint that the film itself castigates, this is an often affecting study of two women - the widow of a colonial bigwig, cherishing memories of her privileged years in India, and the elderly Indian immigrant who to some extent penetrates the English woman's loneliness by forcefully offering friendship. It's a discreet and subtle movie, gradually scratching away at Kerr's veneer of happiness to reveal a core of frustration and resentment. Both the camera, prowling around the gorgeous garden that the women tend together, and Kerr's carefully controlled performance, suggest further depths of dissatisfaction. Far from original, but engaging.]]></review>

With The Most Important Film of the Decade! as a gently tongue-in-cheek poster tagline, Chris Atkins call to arms  or call to protest  offers a well-documented and cautionary outline of Tony Blairs regressive record on human-rights legislation, narrated by David Morrissey and accompanied by a Radio 2 rock-track featuring Radiohead, Oasis et al. Part analytical essay, part comic PowerPoint lecture and part campaigners handbook, it assembles an impressive number of (mostly familiar) cross-party talking heads as it ticks off assaults on such basic rights as freedom of speech and assembly, the rights to privacy and protest and the presumption of innocence and a fair trial. Justified pre- and post-9/11 security concerns have, it argues, been exploited by successive Blair administrations to justify a dangerous accretion of state power at the expense of the public realm. Nothing new here for activists or regular Newsnight viewers; rather, Taking Liberties seems designed as a campaign aid and intended  in its careful exclusion of over-heated or passionate voices  as a putative appeal to slumbering Middle England.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Perhaps the only thing less likely than a Jamaican bobsled team is a Hollywood film inspired by the true story of the crew that competed in the 1988 US Olympics. Not that this sticks closely to the facts; instead, it's another <i>Rocky</i>-style sports movie about the underdogs who achieve public recognition and self-respect. Travelogue shots of happy Jamaicans dancing in the sun give way to patronising comedy as slobbish ex-coach Candy is cajoled into teaching four novices. The missing ingredients are snow and ice, but there's plenty of this when the scene shifts to Canada. In his prime, co-writer Michael Ritchie might have turned this into a caustic <i>Downhill Racer </i>or <i>Bad News Bears</i>-style critique of professional sporting values. Director Turteltaub, on the other hand, patronises both characters and audience with daft knockabout humour, tear-jerking sentiment and racial stereotyping which skates on very thin ice.]]></review>

Five women - aspirant writer Max, college lecturer Kia, reserved vet's assistant Ely, sharp-minded Daria, divorced nurse Evy - do the thing twenty- and thirty-somethings do. They hang out, cook, drink, talk and then talk some more. Here for a change are people who seem to come from somewhere. Troche makes sure that detail is minutely, tellingly observed, and quite naturally adds a moral political dimension. What's also welcome is that the characters' sexual identity is given - they're lesbians. If you can accept that, now we're talking.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This Jamaican rehash of <i>Dirty Harry</i> follows maverick crime fighter Capone (Campbell) on a gun-running case in his old Kingston 'hood. He has to rethink his no-nonsense attitude to community policing, however, when it seems his long-time ghetto friend Ratty (Danvers) may be financing his record producing with more than the occasional block party. Low budget and shot on digital video, this first feature is a peppy morality tale which casts a cynical eye over Kingston's ambivalent attachment to the gun. If you can penetrate the patois, ignore the dodgy sexual politics and let the thumping reggae soundtrack do its work, there's an enjoyably rude energy here.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p><i>Click here to read our interview with 'Burma VJ' director<br /></i><br />Recent events on the streets of Tehran have demonstrated just how vital new technologies are becoming in the global struggle for personal and political freedoms. This will come as no surprise to the members of the Democratic Voice of Burma, a loose, underground collective of local news gatherers dedicated to exposing the truth about the repressive tactics practised by their government. Danish documentarian Anders stergaard's film collects footage shot by DVB activists  plus tastefully integrated recreations  to recall the events of summer 2007, when a popular uprising threatened to spill into outright revolution as the Buddhist monks of Rangoon led their people on to the streets in open protest. <br />This footage, captured on cheap digital cameras by operators fully aware that, if caught, they would be imprisoned and tortured, and smuggled out of the country to the DVBs home bases in Bangkok and Copenhagen, is, by its very nature, rough and unprofessional. But its also raw, immediate and, at times, overwhelmingly powerful, capturing in remarkable, street-level detail the joyous, optimistic first days of the protest and the vicious crackdown that followed. The characters  including faceless editor-in-exile Joshua  are ordinary people engaged in a desperate struggle, not just for their own survival, but for the future of their country in the face of intolerance at home and ignorance abroad. Its a flawlessly constructed piece of work, as relentlessly gripping as it is educational, a righteous and even uplifting paean to the continued importance of collective protest, and a stirring testament to individual bravery. For truthseekers everywhere, Burma VJ is simply unmissable.</p><p><i><i>Click here to read our interview with 'Burma VJ' director</i></i><br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Friedkin's film about the possession of a 12-year-old girl works as an essay in suspension of disbelief and on the level of titillatory exploitation. Although harrowing, its effects depend entirely on technical manipulation, and with Friedkin's pedestrian handling of background story and supporting characters, we're left more or less willing the film towards its climax. Sure enough, during the act of exorcism the girl obliges with a spectacular levitation. It would all be forgiveable, somehow, if the film was at all likely to alter anyone's perceptions one jot. But all <i>The Exorcist</i> does is take its audience for a ride, spewing it out the other end, shaken up but none the wiser.]]></review>

Perhaps such lines work on easier lays like L.A., but putting Natalie Portman in Hasidic garb doesnt equal a fun date to us. Maybe we wouldnt smirk so much if handsome single guys like Bradley Cooper didnt just accidentally jump in the taxi backseat with us. (Like that really happens.) And wasnt your extended bickering with the cabbie a bit much? This isnt <i>Friends.</i> Maybe you enjoy these cavernous restaurants and lofty apartments, but we distinctly recall more grime, more waiting in lines. And Orlando Bloom is hardly a persuasive human being, much less a grubby, amorous composer. Were not coming home with you, not with that skittish jazz music playing and your syrupy Ethan Hawke come-ons.</p><p>Cutesy and generic, <i>New York, I Love You</i> is almost colossally inept at capturing five-boroughs flavorand we havent even gotten to the Brett Ratnerhelmed bit about prom-night sex in Central Park. (Limiting Blake Lively to a single shot must be a cruel joke.) And thenwhats this?an almost vaporous Drea de Matteo flits through the proceedings, haranguing herself in a post-one-night-stand narration on the subway and smiling that crooked grin; you wish Adriana could stay a while longer. A notorious Scarlett Johanssondirected segment has been shorn from the final cut, but having seen it (pretty awkward), we must say that her Coney Island hot dog moment has more authenticity than what remained.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Cline (Delpy), an easy-going Parisian, is on her way back from Budapest to study at the Sorbonne; Jesse (Hawke), a young American, is at the end of a Eurorail tour. They meet on a train just outside Vienna; by the time they reach the station, they've hit it off well enough for Jesse to propose that Cline spend the next 14 hours wandering the city with him, until his flight leaves for the States. Intrigued, she accepts. So begins an unexpected adventure of the heart. What's magical about Linklater's entrancing movie is the way he and his actors manage to convey the emotional truths that underlie all the talk as the potential lovers test each other's opinions and commitment. Funny, poignant and perceptive, this is a brilliant gem.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Watching it now, theres something worryingly wrong with Alan Parkers Bugsy Malone. Its not that this Prohibition-era musical, set principally in a Chicago speakeasy and peopled by young children who talk, act and sing like adults, has dated badly. Its just difficult to pinpoint the films raison dtre, other than to sate the ambitions of a bunch of preening stage-school prima donnas, many of whom never graced the screen again. Paul Williams annoyingly hummable honky-tonk soundtrack punctuates proceedings, which graze the zenith of that seventies inclination towards sexualising teen performers (think Minipops in America). Parker decks out his pre-pubescent cast (including a young Jodie Foster) in tight-fitting leotards and pencil moustaches, then ends the film with a creamy Splurge Gun massacre that probably wouldve made Freud blush. In hindsight, the novelty of subverting character and narrative to such a grand extent must have made Parker seem like the Spike Jonze of his day. Lets be thankful it didnt spawn a genre.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The routine story - members of a scientific expedition exploring the Amazon discover and are menaced by an amphibious gill man - is mightily improved by Arnold's sure sense of atmospheric locations and by the often sympathetic portrait of the monster. Interestingly, the threat is perceived as partly sexual (notably in the scene where the creature swims mesmerised beneath the tightly swimsuited Adams), and thus the film can be seen as a precursor of <i>Jaws</i>.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Franco Zeffirelli's autobiographical WWII Tuscan drama is edged with (uncharacteristic) irony and artistic reserve, turning what is essentially an old-fashioned, faintly twee exercise in nostalgia into an amusing historical entertainment. The master of Chianti-shire manners, John Mortimer has co-scripted, and it feels as much his film as Zeffirelli's. Mortimer details the pretensions, rivalries and snobberies of the so-called Florentine <i>scorpione</i> among whom the film's young hero, the bastard Luca, is fostered; and it's this colony of dotty, politically inert, artistically bent British ex-pats, either taking tea in the Uffizi or talking art in Doney's caf, and variously oblivious, contemptuous or supportive of the fascists, which holds centre stage. They're played with ease by a roll call of theatrical dames. The rest is a gently teasing tribute to wartime British pluck (read: muddling through) and American 'can-do', lit like a lost summer by David Watkin.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Olmi's uncompromising reconstruction of peasant life in turn-of-the-century Lombardy marks a return to his origins in neo-realism and non-professional casts. Choreographed as an ensemble work that admits no star performers, his film takes its unhurried pace from the lives of the dirt farmers it observes - lives of repetitive drudgery punctuated by cautious moments of felicity. Its gently muted colour camerawork succeeds in covering the exquisite landscape with a thin patina of mud, while for two of its three hours the changing of the seasons is the closest the film comes to a dramatic event. By showing peasant exploitation as neither triumphant Calvary nor action-packed drama, Olmi refutes both <i>1900</i> and <i>Padre Padrone</i>, and creates a near-perfect hermetic universe, punctured only in those rare moments when, as tautologous as the film's English title, he dots the 'i's on the amply demonstrated Marxist message. Still, a near faultless and major film.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[With so many films vying for space in our overcrowded cinemas, its puzzling that this ham-fisted 2006 tearjerker should be freed from the archives. It follows braying Mexican football also-ran Jose (Eduardo Verstegui) who, via generic tragic circumstances, has had to settle in as head chef of his brothers New York eatery. Playing hooky so he can spend the day with recently pregnant, recently fired waitress Nina (Tammy Blanchard), he proceeds  in an eerie, softly-softly manner  to coax her out of a pencilled-in trip to the abortion clinic. Peddling its conservative agenda with all the subtlety of a juggernaut road race through a Welsh mining village, all the tears of sorrow and joy amount to little when the solutions the film offers are so incoherent and narrowly focused. The dramatic set-ups are lowest-common-denominator soap opera fluff, and Monteverdes decision to cross-cut snappily between parallel scenes makes it impossible to engage with characters. Blanchards mournful turn is better than the film, but its not enough.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When Kidulthood came out in 2006, I was put off by the over-ambition of Noel Clarkes screenplay, which tried to cram every hot-button teen issue into a melodramatic 90 minutes of violence, sex and drugs on Londons streets. It had an impressive energy and a little insight but the acting was ropey and the directing superficial. Its follow-up, Adulthood, is again written by Clarke, who had an ensemble part in Kidulthood, but now he directs and reassumes the role of Sam Peel, a lad fresh out of jail after serving six years for the manslaughter that brought the first film to a close. Theres barely a scene without Clarke skulking about the streets of Ladbroke Grove and he has several brooding close-ups that make you wonder if he has ever heard of humility.<br />The story has a tighter focus than its predecessor: Sam spends a busy day trying to avoid being dragged back into a cycle of revenge and violence. He fails  and much chasing and cursing follow. Theres a thoughtful side to this maturer sequel as Clarke ponders the struggle of growing up: a plot involving a lonely young woman (Scarlett Alice Johnson) scarred by her past offers a welcome, maudlin aside from the gun and knife play. But there are bum notes that will have people chewing the arm rest: a posh guy buying drugs is the worst sort of cartoon, and the location of a late showdown  Compromise Avenue, W11  is a distraction. Its a film with its target audience  teenage boys and the youngest of men  firmly in mind and were never far from a rapid edit, a loud tune or a fight.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The Utopia created in <i>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure</i> is threatened by two robot doppelgngers of the meat-headed, mop-topped duo. These two Terminators travel back in time to present-day San Dimas, California, and swiftly despatch the real Bill &amp; Ted. But death is only the beginning... The first Bill &amp; Ted movie remained a minor cult in Britain, but this far more cinematic sequel deserves a wider audience. Winter (Bill) and Reeves (Ted) make a comic pairing to rival Laurel and Hardy, blundering through life - and the afterlife - with an endearing naivety (when the Grim Reaper promises them their lives if they beat him at chess, they suggest a game of Battleships). The eventual triumph of US junk culture is somewhat offensive, even if prophetic, and there are a few naff ideas; but for those who appreciate dude-speak and bozo humour, this is a very funny film.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Thomas (Reeves), a salaryman at a software company, leads a secret double life. As 'Neo' he's a computer hacker much in demand. But only when Trinity (Moss) introduces him to charismatic seer Morpheus (Fishburne) does Neo learn that the whole world's unwittingly in the same boat: life as we know it is merely virtual reality, a 'matrix' designed by mankind's overlords to hold us in unquestioning obeisance. Not only are Morpheus and his rebel crew fighting to regain our freedom, but the leader has a bee in his bonnet: might not Neo be the One, who'll lead us to salvation? For its first hour, the second feature by the Wachowskis works well enough as an ambitious if rather portentous dystopian fantasy in the vein of <i>eXistenZ</i> and <i>Blade Runner</i>. Though sometimes a little clumsy, the frequent switches between the different 'realities' are entertainingly ingenious, Bill Pope's camerawork and Owen Paterson's designs are slickly impressive, and the effects neatly embrace Cronenbergian body horror and comic strip panache. But the characters, too, are paper thin (Keanu, especially), while the promising premise is steadily wasted as the film turns into a fairly routine action pic, complete with facile Hollywood heroics, cod kung-fu homilies and computer enhanced martial arts scenes. Weaving is engagingly odd as the rebels' arch enemy Smith, but even he can't hold the attention in what's finally yet another slice of overlong, high concept hokum.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Perhaps the most extraordinary and riveting film of Antonioni's entire career; and correspondingly impossible to synopsise. Monica Vitti is an electronics engineer's neurotic wife, wandering in bewilderment through a modern industrial landscape (the film is set in Ravenna) which Antonioni has coloured in the most startling and original way imaginable. The film is an aesthetic feast, but don't let that distract you from the haunting intricacy of the plot and the performances. Only Richard Harris, as Corrado, the mining engineer who becomes her refuge but who is just passing through, seems uneasy; despite what so many critics said at the time, Vitti's portrayal of the confused girl, alienated from the stark technological landscape around her, is among her very best.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The complete version (39 minutes longer than the print originally released) 'explains' no more than the cut version, but at least Tarkovsky's mysteries and enigmas are now intact. Rublev was a minor icon-painter of the early 1400s. Tarkovsky re-imagines him as a Christ-like cypher for the sufferings of a divided Russia under the Tartar invaders: a troubled visionary reduced to years of silence by the horrors that he witnesses, who finally rediscovers the will to speak - and to paint. The film offers eight imaginary episodes from Rublev's life: the most brilliant coup is the story of a beardless boy saving his own life by pretending that he knows how to cast a giant bell - and finding that he can do it. This boy's blind faith rekindles Rublev's confidence in himself and his people, leading the film into its blazing climax: a montage of details from Rublev's surviving icons.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In <i>Theorem</i>, Pasolini achieved his most perfect fusion of Marxism and religion with a film that is both political allegory and mystical fable. Terence Stamp plays the mysterious Christ or Devil figure who stays briefly with a wealthy Italian family, seducing them one by one. He then goes as quickly as he had come, leaving their whole life-pattern in ruins. What would be pretentious and strained in the hands of most directors, with Pasolini takes on an intense air of magical revelation. In fact, the superficially improbable plot retains all the logic and  certainty of a detective story. With bizarre appropriateness, it was one of the last films made by Stamp before he virtually disappeared from the international film scene for some years.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Click here to read our interview with the film's composer</p><p>From Jour de Fte to Cline and Julie Go Boating, theres an enchanting minor strain in French cinema devoted to visually reproducing the heady sensation of going to the cinema. And so it is with Jacques Demys pastel-hued masterpiece Les Demoiselles de Rochefort, a luminous musical about dreams, romance and destiny which lovingly reworks the classic Hollywood putting on a show template into an essay on the emotional rollercoaster ride that is movie-going.<br />Released here in a sparkling new print, the film centres on Catherine Deneuve and Franoise Dorlac as the pair of twins, born in the sign of Gemini looking to escape the sleepy environs of Rochefort for life in the big city. When an all-singin, all-dancin motorcycle roadshow rolls into town, the girls decide to give one last big performance before upping sticks and moving on. Pedants may feel inclined to pick holes in Norman Maens stuffy choreography and some of the less-than-subtle lip-synching, but most will already be swept off their feet by Michel Legrands scintillating jazz-pop score, charismatic supporting turns from Gene Kelly, Danielle Darrieux and Michel Piccoli, and  predominantly  Demys own infectious <i>joie de vivre</i>. See it, and swoon</p><p>Click here to read our interview with the film's composer  <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The greatest of the surreally anarchic threesome's films (foursome here), this is a breathtakingly funny and imaginative spoof of war movie heroics, with a couple of Ruritanian states going to war because someone calls President Groucho an upstart (anyway, he's paid a month's advance rent on the battlefield). Totally irreverent towards patriotism, religion (a song proclaims 'We Got Guns, They Got Guns, All God's Chillun Got Guns'), diplomacy, courtroom justice, and anything even vaguely respectable, it also includes what is perhaps the Brothers' funniest scene ever: an immaculately timed and performed sequence with a broken mirror in which Groucho, Chico and Harpo look absolutely identical. A masterpiece.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It's no fun being in your early teens, especially if you're none too tall. So thinks Josh Baskin, having been denied a ride on a fairyground superloop. But neither is being a kid in a grown-up body so hot, as Josh discovers after a carnival wishing-machine grants the change overnight. What do you do when Mom doesn't recognise you, and thinks you're your own abductor? How do you get a job when you can't drive and have no social security number? And when you do find work with a toy-design company, how do you cope with board meetings, office rivalries, and swish staff parties? Marshall's movie may be a mite predictable, but it's genuinely funny, thanks partly to Hanks' engagingly gauche and gangly performance as the overgrown Josh, and partly to a script that steers admirably clear of gross innuendo. Much of the humour derives from Josh's inability to comprehend adult life; much of its charm from the way his forthright innocence steadily revitalises those around him. Admittedly, this latter theme makes for an ending oozing with saccharine sentiment; but until then Marshall, Hanks, and his co-stars seldom put a foot wrong.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A huge critical and commercial success in Korea, Bong's film fictionalises the search for the country's first recorded serial killer. (The actual crimes - rapes and murders - began in Gyeongi Province, outside Seoul, in 1986 and continued for some five years; the perpetrator was never caught.) The film centres on the efforts of the local cops and an officer from Seoul to sift evidence, identify patterns, follow up leads and interrogate suspects; there are several false leads before a woman cop notices a correlation between the attacks and requests for a particular song on the radio. Much of the plentiful gallows humour springs from the clashes between the poorly educated and trained local force and the more sophisticated urban detective, but nothing works out predictably. All of the characters, including the prime suspect, are victims of the Korea of the 1980s: living under dictatorial military government and inured by a Cold War mentality to acts of violence and brutality. Bong brilliantly spreads the blame by using multiple points of view for his <i>mise-en-scne</i>, and gets tremendous performances from his stars and supporting cast alike.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A man drives around villages and the desert hills offering a series of carefully selected men a lift and unusually well paid work; he's not looking for a pick-up but, as we discover after a while, someone to help in his planned suicide. Characteristically, Kiarostami's <i>Palme d'Or</i> winner is low on narrative drive, slowly but steadily revealing more and more information, visual and verbal, until we are totally caught up in his protagonist's psychological and ethical dilemma. (Suicide is forbidden to Muslims.) As ever, the subtle, deceptively simple <i>mise-en-scne </i>speaks volumes, notably a nightmare of noisy industrialism in the desert, and the remarkable penultimate scene, which goes even further in its minimalist ambiguity than the final shots of the last two movies of Kiarostami's trilogy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This enshrines a brilliantly loathsome characterisation by Stuhr as the provincial entertainer driven by the sweet smell of success as he wheels and deals to achieve his pathetic goal of becoming MC for a gala inaugurating a new hotel. The political parable is neat enough as his power plays are scrutinised in vivid detail, but also pretty facile. Satires digging at the state through representations in microcosm became a dime a dozen in Eastern European films around this time.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[If a visitor from Mars needed a crash course in sexism, this would serve. Freshly demobbed, Brian Flanagan (Cruise) takes a Greyhound to NYC, hell-bent on self-improvement. He enlists in business school, but soon concludes that 'notta goddam thing those professors say makes any difference on the streets'. Brian opts instead to imbibe wisdom (and vast quantities of alcohol) at the feet of grizzled bartender Doug (Brown), a would-be guru of the <i>in vino veritas</i> school. Soon Bri is the most dazzling barman on the Upper East Side, and finds that women fall for his bottle-juggling technique and 'killer' smile (permanent rictus is nearer the mark). When he finds his true love (Shue) - no make-up, a 'good' girl - she immediately becomes dependent, cries a lot, and becomes pregnant. Conveniently she's also massively rich. The inevitable occurs, and a long happy future of monogamy, money-making and self-righteousness is in the offing. A tale of cock, signifying nothing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It's almost an understatement to say that <i>Jubilee</i> has a lot going for it. Jarman has conceived the ingenious idea of transporting Queen Elizabeth I through time to witness the future disintegration of her kingdom as marauding girl punks roam a junky and violent urban landscape. Its patchily humorous evocation of this landscape lays the film open to criticism: several sequences stoop to juvenile theatrics, and the determined sexual inversion (whereby most women become freakish 'characters', and men loose-limbed sex objects) comes to look disconcertingly like a misogynist binge. But in conception the film remains highly original, and it does deliver enough of the goods to sail effortlessly away with the title of Britain's first official punk movie: 'Rule Britannia', as mimed by Jordan, should have 'em pogoing in the aisles.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>When watching this wise and moving modern parable from the former French colony and west African state of Chad, its worth  bearing in mind that soon after director Mahamat-Saleh Haroun (Bye Bye Africa, Abouna) started shooting in the Chad capital of NDjamena, civil war eruped yet again and regularly threatened the safety of his crew as they continued filming. Youd never know it, though, from the quiet storytelling and subtle performances that define Daratt, which, like Harouns earlier Abouna, assumes an intimate focus and a gifted humanism but leaves the viewer thinking much more widely than just about the lives of the characters on screen. Its apt, too, considering the threat to the films production, that Harouns purpose is to show that cycles of violence and predetermind patterns of war can sometimes be avoided by personal strength alone.</p><p>As in Abouna, the absence of a parent hangs over Daratt, but this time we know what became of the father of 20-year-old Atim (Ali Bacha Barka): he was killed during the civil war by Nassara (Youssouf Djaoro), an ageing, weak man who now lives comfortably as a baker in the Chad capital. As the film opens, the radio declares a government amnesty for all war criminals, yet Atims blind grandfather responds angrily by giving his taciturn, impressionable grandson a gun and sending him to avenge his sons death. When Atim finds Nassara, he hesitates, and rather than firing the gun in his pocket he takes a job and a bed from Nassara. Its now that the films most interesting conundrums kick in. Will he carry out his mission? Will he reciprocate the paternal fondness shown him by an unsuspecting Nassara? And is Nassara as unsuspecting as he appears? Blessed with a near-silent but always telling performance from Barka, Haroun dances around all these questions and more, but only allows an answer in the superb final moments: until then, the debate is as much with us as with Atim. Beautifully and simply photographed on location, Daratt is a fine follow-up to Abouna and confirms Haroun as one of Africas leading filmmakers, a committed humanist and a sly political commentator.</p>]]></review>
