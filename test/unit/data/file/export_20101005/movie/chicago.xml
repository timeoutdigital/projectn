      <review><![CDATA[Fifty years on, you could say that Hitchcocks sleek, wry, paranoid thriller caught the zeitgeist perfectly: Cold War shadiness, secret agents of power, urbane modernism, the ant-like bustle of city life, and a hint of dread behind the sharp suits of affluence. Cary Grants Roger Thornhill, the films sharply dressed ad exec who is sucked into a vortex of mistaken identity, certainly wouldnt be out of place in Mad Men. But theres nothing dated about this perfect storm of talent, from Hitchcock and Grant to writer Ernest Lehman (Sweet Smell of Success), co-stars James Mason and Eva Marie Saint, composer Bernard Herrmann and even designer Saul Bass, whose opening-credits sequence still manages to send a shiver down the spine.<br />Hitchcock breezes through a tongue-in-cheek, nightmarish plot with a lightness of touch thats equalled by a charming performance from Grant (below), who copes effortlessly with the scripts dash between claustrophobia and intrigue on one hand and romance and comedy on the other. The story is a pass-the-parcel of escalating threats, all of them interior fears turned inside-out: doubting mothers, untrustworthy lovers, vague government handlers, corrupt cops. Within minutes of the films opening, shady strangers in a hotel lobby mistake Thornhill for a George Caplin and from there we sprint from country house to the United Nations, from the ticket hall of Grand Central Station to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. Thornhills ignorance of his fate and complete lack of control offer Hitchcock a brilliant blank canvas on which to experiment with a story that would sound ludicrous on paper, yet it feels like anythings possible in Lehmans playful script. Im an advertising man, not a red herring, says Thornhill. He couldnt be more mistaken.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its quite likely that Staff Sgt. William James (Renner)the
bomb-defusing expert at the center of the terrific Iraq War action film
<i>The Hurt Locker</i>was named by screenwriter Mark Boal after a
certain pragmatic 19th-century philosopher. On the
cleverness-to-profundity scale, that falls somewhere between calling a
desert-island survivalist Locke and christening a living stuffed tiger
Hobbes. But James is more than his moniker, not so much
larger-than-life as eternally engaged, gruntlike, with one thing he
does better than anyone else.<p>Renner, whose half-muscled pudginess calls to mind Fassbinder circa <i>Fox and His Friends</i>,
gets inside Jamess skin in ways that a more seasoned celebrity could
not. Its a role that might have easily have come across as one-note,
especially with a story that toggles between machismo-laden home-base
drama and perilously prolonged fieldwork. Yet in this actors hands,
the character comes off with a credible working-class clarityhes less
concerned with heroics than with doing a good job and pissing the night
away.</p><p>The James-free prologue, which features the first of two
star cameos, sets the stakes high. But Bigelow doesnt mine traditional
suspense so much as impart a queasy feeling of monotony. <i>The Hurt Locker</i>
is all about repetition. Superimposed titles count down the days left
in James and his squads rotation, though theres little sense of
movement toward an ultimate end. As the opening Chris Hedges quote
(war is a drug) suggests, there are no accomplishments in this line
of work, only an unending round of highs, lows and in-betweens.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Kitsch is most enjoyable when it doesnt know its kitsch. Everyone involved in Shutter Island  most obviously director Martin Scorsese and star Leonardo DiCaprio  seem to be taking this berserk, meandering story absolutely seriously, which only serves to make an already fun psychological thriller all the more ludicrous and entertaining.<br />The film is set in 1954. DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a US marshal dispatched to the titular oceanbound asylum to investigate the disappearance of a criminally insane inmate from her locked cell. He soon begins to suspect that this remote facility isnt all it appears  is Ben Kingsleys avuncular psychiatrist really as kindly and welfare-conscious as he seems? Why are the guards so heavily armed? And whats with the mysterious lighthouse that all the patients seem so terrified of? To make matters worse theres a hurricane coming in, the generators are on the blink and Teddys new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) is starting to look decidedly shifty. Taxi Driver this aint.<br />Actually, the Scorsese movie it most resembles is his previous exercise in Hitchcockian overkill, 1991s Cape Fear. With DiCaprio rather limp and forgettable in the lead, Shutter Island lacks the centrifugal might of De Niros powerhouse central performance in the earlier film. But it compensates with pure visual, aural and narrative excess: this is modern gothic taken to its (il)logical extreme, a work of pure operatic delirium. The closest Shutter Island gets to a commanding, De Niro-like presence might be its perverse, overbearing soundtrack, a selection of the most doom-laden pieces by modern composers ranging from Kryzstof Penderecki to Max Richter. Every twist in the tale is accompanied by a frenzied flurry of violins, every moment of violence underscored by a pounding, atonal piano crescendo.<br />While the narrative, adapted from Dennis Lehanes 2003 novel, is hopelessly convoluted, the film is held together by the sheer bludgeoning force of Scorseses directorial vision. Never one to shy away from visual overindulgence, Scorsese has used Shutter Island as an excuse to really throw open his box of tricks, chucking in gaudy but strikingly beautiful dream sequences, harrowing (if rather tasteless) concentration camp flashbacks and the most thunderous, howling rainstorms this side of Suspiria. <br />In fact, Argentos film, a similarly monumental and manic triumph of style over substance, may be the most appropriate comparison here. And while Scorsese may lack the giallo masters manic invention, the tension between his natural tendency towards old-fashioned Hollywood classicism and his evident desire to cut loose gives the film its strange, irrestistible power. As senseless, perverse and unwieldy as it undoubtedly is, Shutter Island might be Scorseses most enjoyable film in a decade.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Blunt is such a fine actress that its strange to see her upstaged
by a Cavalier King Charles spaniel. The dog is the most interesting
character in <i>The Young Victoria</i>, a historical drama so inert
that you begin to wonder why anyone paid for the costumes. The concept
of young biopics is itself flawed: Yes, Victoria ushered in an era of
progress and plenty in Britain, but all of that takes place after the
movie ends. Instead, her compressed youth is played as protofeminist
high romance, a concept already exhausted (and then some) by the Jane
Campion oeuvre.</p><p>All shall sigh as one as Victoria (Blunt) resists
signing her authority over to a regentan unheard-of failure to kowtow
to authority that onscreen is never shown as anything other than a
no-brainer. Later, she forgoes marriage to a bland and unscrupulous
politician (Bettany) in favor of the blander and excruciatingly
scrupulous Prince Albert (Friend), who is shockedshocked!to find that
it sometimes rains in England. Smacking of screenwriters desperation
(at least in context), even a late-breaking assassination attempt fails
to shake the movies stupor. The script is by the talented Julian
Fellowes (<i>Gosford Park</i>), but these films are a matter of style and perspective; change the title to <i>The Young</i> [insert famous person here], and it would make little difference.</p>]]></review>

While the others trade in stop-motion precision and CGI physics, this one goes fully for abstraction. Its a brooding story set firmly in the Dark Ages and Celtic legend. When smoke billows over the walled, titular enclavea home to gentle monks and familiesthe plumes come in looping, circular scribbles and your mind has to make the leap. (It does.)</p><p>In Kells lives young Brendan (McGuire), who, shepherded by his severe abbot father (the tart-tongued Gleeson), intends one day to illuminate a book with his goose-quilled pen. The boy yearns to see the outside world, though, and this is where he goesthe mostly hand-drawn animation morphs into strange new shapes as the trees narrow, crows caw menacingly and a female fairy slinks around in the form of a snowy panther. Its all fairly enchanting, and theres the added euphoria of being free of the incessant pop-culture riffing of either Disney or Altman-loving hipster directors. The movie isnt quite suitable for the extremely young, but its apocalyptic tint may be catnip for smart preteens. Theyll breathe in the chilly air of a mysterious forestthe way forests should be. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Filmmakers love a good prison. No, scrub that, filmmakers adore a bad prison. You can see why. For writers and directors, the volatile jail is a ready-made theatre, its prisoners and guards with their various conflicts and loyalties all perfect players for a drama that, if it tries hard enough, can reflect life on the outside too. <br />For French director Jacques Audiard (A Self-Made Hero, The Beat That My Heart Skipped), a master of the old-school French thriller  ie thrilling and meaningful  his fifth film offers the chance to pull off both a state-of-nation primal scream and a terrific crime flick. He gives us Malik (Tahar Rahim), a French-Arab convict who enters a concrete-and-steel hell to serve a sentence of six years (so we know he cant have done anything too dreadful). He tries to keep his head down, but this isnt that sort of place. The ruling bully boys are the Corsican inmates, led by ageing but vicious Csar (Niels Arestrup), who forces Malik to kill another inmate in a very successful scene thats one of the most claustrophobic and disturbing episodes Ive seen in a long while. From here, Malik is Csars vassal, committed to working for him on the inside and, later, using a series of day-release excursions to represent his criminal interests on the outside.<br /><br />But Malik is a clever individualist  a survivalist even  and at the same time that he learns to read and write, he exploits a friendship with another French-Arab prisoner, now released, to pursue his own drug deals and quietly invest in a power base within the jail. This is a world where partnerships are formed only for a reason, loyalties are fluid, friends barely exist at all. Politically, its a cynical film. Hope is absent.<br />Whether, though, it says anything meaningful about France, Im not so sure. Malik is an extreme character, so his experience doesnt reflect the French-Arab dilemma as a whole, even if the point is made about the number of immigrants in French jails and how being sent to prison for a minor offence can snowball into something else entirely. Audiard suggests that being an underdog  socially, racially, economically  in an unfriendly society can lead to desocialisation and anti-social behaviour. But Maliks story is so wild that it obscures such ideas.<br /><br />That said, its testament to Audiards skill at plunging us headfirst into a vicious parallel world that we mostly believe the films twisted logic and rituals. Also, his presentation of violence as a profit-and-loss account is effective and mature: while Maliks initial murder may get him far, we witness nightly visions of his victim coming back to his cell to haunt him. But there are several bite-your-tongue moments. The film is realist in style and mood, but for every five spot-on observations, there is one flight of wild fancy. Ive seen the film twice and still find baffling an episode in which Malik predicts that a deer will hit a car, thereby suggesting he is a prophet.<br />But the sheer force of Audiards direction can support such enigmas. It forces you, bullies you, persuades you to love his filmmaking style  even if not always to understand his motives.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[If you thought Mussolinis record as a statesman was patchy, wait until you see how he treated his lovers. Italian veteran Marco Bellocchio delivers an operatic slice of historical muckraking which exhumes the tale of Ida Dalser (Giovanna Mezzogiorno), spurned wife of the lantern-jawed lothario who would become Il Duce (Filippo Timi). Smitten by the rhetoric of the young socialist firebrand, Idas courtship with Benito takes place in the shadows until he is drawn into national politics and she is left destitute but certain she can win him back. Much like Paolo Sorrentinos Il Divo, the dizzying technical flair employed to tell Dalsers story (back projection, animated intertitles, a bombastic score) is as much a clue to whats going on with these characters as the fragmentary details of the story. Timi channels Klaus Kinski in his virtuoso reading of Mussolini, projecting with the full force of his muscular frame. In contrast, Mezzogiorno superbly expresses Dalsers decline from sultry assurance to anguished obsession.<br /><br />Its a film rife with ambiguities and ellipses that will intrigue or infuriate depending on taste. The motivation behind Mussolinis rejection of his wife is vague, while Dalsers commitment to winning recognition from her husband confirms rather than refutes her insanity, making it tough to sympathise with her. Yet, its clear that Bellocchio wants Dalsers martyrdom to be read as a wider statement on the fate of Italy under Fascism, making the film an astute study of amour fou and a cautionary tale about how the worship of false idols can lead to personal and national collapse.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Guy Ritchie the director and Guy Ritchie the screenwriter part ways for this latest spin on the Sherlock Holmes story, and if separation turns into divorce it would be no bad thing, at least on the evidence of this big-hearted, atmospheric entertainment. Shed of his tedious infatuation with off-the-peg London gangsters, Ritchie proves a competent teller of the fast-paced, not po-faced yarn. Here, Robert Downey Jr draws on his wild-eyed side to play the detective, while Jude Law assumes the more sober clothes of his sidekick, Dr Watson. Plunging into their careers mid-flow, we watch as they confront a conspiracy of national proportions. <br />They discover an aristocrat, Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), in the middle of a ritualistic murder of a young woman. In this early scene, Ritchies Holmes reveals himself as a physical titan in a witty interlude in which we witness in slow motion the microscopic details of his plan to incapacitate an assailant by brute force. The villain hangs, but, for Holmes and Watson, this is just the start of a series of fights, rescues, escapes and revelations, all cloaked in creaky supernatural mumbo jumbo.<br />Ritchies Sherlock Holmes is effective as a caricatured comedy adventure and shows some fidelity to Arthur Conan Doyle, especially in Downey Jrs portrayal of the eccentric but cold-hearted Holmes. The banter between Holmes and Watson isnt as witty as it should be, but the detectives lone mutterings, especially his deductions, are fun. The films biggest success is its evocation of Victorian London, via much location work and CG rendering: here, Ritchies grittily romantic view of our city comes into its own, culminating in a delicious climax on the girders of a half-built Tower Bridge.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Above and beyond its bizarrely styled titlechanged to avoid confusion with the Dakota Fanning action film <i>Push</i>this
Sundance winner is a tough sell even for those who like it. The movie
is at once irritatingly glib and undeniably bold in its portrait of a
late-80s, illiterate Harlem teenager (Sidibe) with no obvious escape
route. Shes pregnant with her second child by her father; her daughter
was born with Down syndrome and is currently being raised by her
abusive mother, Mary (MoNique), who blames Precious for stealing her
husband. Mary also sees Precious as a financial burden andto humiliate
her for her obesityforces her to overeat.</p><p>Producer-turned-director Daniels (his only other feature is the reputedly nutso <i>Shadowboxer</i>)
has a tendency to fetishize misery, shooting domestic brawls and child
endangerment in a way that seems too arty for comfort. (The sequences
representing Preciouss fantasies are particularly cringeworthy.) On
the other hand, its rare to see such a convincing or poetic portrayal
of life on the margins. Eventually, <i>Precious</i> emerges as an
unsentimental pro-education film: Preciouss only way out is to attend
a special-ed school, where shes assisted by a patient teacher (Patton)
andoutside the classroomby a social worker (a surprisingly good
Carey, whod be unrecognizable if you didnt know she was in the film).
The movie strains to withhold judgment; even Mary gets a redemptive
monologue. The bottom line is that youve never seen anything quite
like thisin its highs, its lows, its gaffes, its embarrassments or its
uplift.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Although far better than its troubled history lead one to fear, this gory, gothic take on the classic lycanthropic love story has had its romantic heart ripped out. Returning to his estranged fathers crumbling pile in 1891  to investigate his brothers disappearance  actor Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) falls for his dead siblings mourning fiance, Gwen (Emily Blunt). But before this spark of love can ignite, Lawrence is bitten by the lunar-tic creature the locals fear, and must confront the beast buried within himself. With its mist-shrouded sets, gruesome slaughter and copious CGI, this is a surprisingly respectful updating of the 1941 Universal original. Thanks to Rick Bakers make-up effects, Del Toros transformations from handsome lover to hairy, howling beast are frighteningly convincing; Anthony Hopkins is restrained as his emotionally detached father; and a cruelly underused Blunt is all-a-quiver as the beautiful, bereaved Gwen. Ultimately, though, neither Joe Johnstons efficient direction nor Danny Elfmans hard-working score can lift the familiar storyline out of the ordinary. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Best wipe 8 1/2 from your mind, or at least delay seeing Fellinis loopy masterpiece, if youre going to enjoy this angsty romp through the directors 1963 film about a fictional Italian filmmaker, Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis), who loses his mojo and might be about to lose his marbles and his marriage.<br />Surprisingly, though, theres lots in this musical version, itself an adaptation of a 1980s Broadway show, that relates to the sombre heart of Fellinis original. We still get Guidos formative childhood memory of watching a prostitute perform on the beach (although this time it is Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas brilliantly belting out the films foot-tapping anthem Be Italian). We also get the lingering ghost of his mother (Sophia Loren!), the pain of his adultery and the madness of his creative impasse. Also, Fellinis meshing of dream and reality is oddly suited to the unreal tendencies of a musical, although its anybodys guess what the director would have made of Penlope Cruz throwing herself around in stockings and suspenders and upping the sex factor beyond anything Claudia Cardinale offered in the original.<br />The biggest difference, though, is that almost 50 years later, director Rob Marshall (Chicago) is able to play the story of 8 1/2 as a nostalgia piece. He fetishises the look and feel of 1960s Italy and especially Rome so that the films mood of artistic melancholia is expressed on a canvas that comes dangerously close to looking like an ad for Italian coffee. Marshall and his writers, including the late Anthony Minghella, also stress the humour of Guidos philandering, often preferring that his inner turmoil goes no further than chain-smoking. To give Day-Lewis his due, the actor grounds the films sillier tendencies in a charming performance of mercurial despair. Hes well supported by Marion Cotillard, who conveys the sadness of being Guidos wife, although both Nicole Kidman as his leading lady and Kate Hudson as an admiring journalist are little more than window-dressing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Attempts to claim <i>Bad Lieutenant</i> as prime Herzog are
probably futile, as its difficult to tell whether the movie intends to
be taken seriously or whether its a mad experiment featuring Cage as
its chief variable. Either way, is there anything not to like? Bearing
no resemblance to Abel Ferraras 1992 masterpiece apart from a central
character type, <i>Bad Lieutenant: POCNO</i> essentially takes the
script for a mediocre cop drama and retrofits it with Cages most
batshit performance yet. Scowling, hunched over from back pain, given
to Tourettic pronouncements (sometimes delivered in a Cagney accent)
and alarmingly nonchalant about his drug habit (Whatever I take is
prescription, except for the heroin), Cage plays the character as a
Klaus Kinski figure. Hes spent most of the decade pushing the bounds
of what it means to go over the top, and this time his directoralways
interested in forces of natureis eager to see how far hell reach.
There are also other Herzog touches, including an interlude shot from
an iguanas point of view and and a fantastically abrupt denouement.</p><p>If
we can take this driest of humorists seriously, the movies New
Orleansset crime story begs to be read as a commentary on privilege: A
white cop flouts the laws hes charged with enforcing, and society
rewards him for it. (He also belongs to Herzogs gallery of quixotic
dreamers, innocently recalling a childhood treasure hunt to
prostitute-girlfriend Mendes.) Still, who cares? The movie includes
Cage raving about his lucky crack pipe and cutting off an old ladys
oxygen supply. If you enjoyed Cages histrionics in <i>The Wicker Man</i>, <i>Bad Lieutenant</i> is for you.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Everything you may have heard about Mulligans breakout performance
in this film is true; with baffling ease, she steals a movie from such
noted movie-stealers as Molina, Sarsgaard and Thompson. As Jenny, a
too-clever girl in early 1960s London who gets involved with an older
man, Mulligan delivers little surprises in almost every scene. It can
be a line reading or the way she carries herself or an exquisitely held
pause. No one around her is bad; its just that shes so good.</p><p>Jenny
seems to be conducting her life with a slight ironic detachment, so
that when she says shes planned out the loss of her virginity for her
17th birthday, it seems like a little joke shes sharing with life. For
a while, its fun watching her break free of the carefully plotted life
her father (Molina) has in mind for her in the most scandalous way she
can, by dating 30-ish operator David (Sarsgaard). And Jennys
justification for her rebellion against conformity, delivered in an
amazing speech to school headmistress Thompson, is so compelling that
its a bit of a shock when the script turns moralistic and conservative
in the second half. It says a lot for Mulligan and Sarsgaard that for
nearly half the movie they make the idea of a 30-ish man dating a girl
of 17 seem daring but not icky. In this day and age, thats a hell of
an accomplishment, and its largely Mulligans doing.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[We tend to make a fuss of debutants. We celebrate their precocity. We excuse their naivety. But sometimes the word is misleading. Take Tom Ford. A Single Man is the 48 year olds first film, but can we really call a man who spent ten years as the creative director of Gucci a beginner? Couture is not cinema, but there are similarities. Both have a tendency to crush art with commerce. Both demand that an army of creatives  art directors, production designers, photographers and the rest  unite behind a vision that is sold ruthlessly to the public. So its worth remembering that Fords toolbag was already full to brimming when he embarked on his first film  though whether or not he knew how to use those tools is another thing entirely.<br />Christopher Isherwoods short 1964 novel A Single Man is a superb choice for a concise, intimate film. Its events are few, its emotional power is cumulative. The book visits one day in the life of George, a gay British expat and middle-aged literature teacher in 1962 Los Angeles. We learn gradually that George lost his younger partner, Jim, in a car crash and discover much later that this is a significant day for George, a slow reveal that gives the text a random, quotidian quality.<br />Ford turns the book on its head so that we know both these things from the start. But other than that, the books interior nature and sense of wandering remain in Fords delicate, moving film. We follow George (Colin Firth) closely, often alone, from morning to night. We watch as he gives a lesson on Aldous Huxley and join him on a drunken evening at the home of his soulmate and compatriot, Charlotte (Julianne Moore). Later, were with him during a late-night flirtation with a pupil, Kenny (Nicholas Hoult). And, in flashback, we see snapshots of his earlier, happier life with Jim (Matthew Goode).<br />As a director, Ford manages to exude both extreme confidence and first-time nerves. Only a beginner would decide that the best way to add structure to a near-perfect story is to insert a gun from almost the very first scene. But the control and precision with which Ford tells his story helps us to ignore this choice and still trust his vision, which falls off the screen with an intoxicating fluidity, helped by evocative editing of sound and image and an increasingly affecting score by Abel Korzeniowski. The film looks gorgeous. Young Spanish DoP Eduard Gran, a graduate of the National Film and Television School, shoots on an old 35mm stock that gives the images a soft precision. Almost all the film is colour, but the colours tell a story themselves: Ford manipulates the films brightness so that it glows and darkens depending on Georges mood. Rather than coming across as a gimmick, this serves the emotional ebb and flow of the book well and helps to turn the literary into the cinematic.<br />Maybe the film is too pristine. In this world, dust doesnt land, paint doesnt peel and grass doesnt grow. Georges black-and-white suit-and-tie combo is too perfect and his house is a modernist dream. His partner was an architect, were told. His director is a fashion designer, were thinking.<br />But nothing distracts from the empathy and understanding we have for George, and on that the film must live or die. Firths portrayal of a man repressing his grief while being unable to repress his instinct for love and for life is excellent and moving, while Fords balancing of depth and surface is precarious but ultimately winning. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Like its predecessor 'Flanders', this is watchable enough and an improvement on the wretched 'LHumanit', but it still feels bogus in its Bressonian aspirations and mechanical in its religiosity and mysterious narrative drift. About (but is it really?) a young nun returned to the world to curb her more extreme inclinations, whose chance encounter with two Arab brothers from the Parisian projects has literally earth-shaking consequences, the film is often utterly implausible except on the most superficial levels. Sokolowski is occasionally effective as the lead, but shes not subtle enough to make the film make proper sense; an inevitable redemptive ending is pure, plagiaristic tosh. <br />]]></review>

And perhaps it's just those lowered expectations going to work, but '45365' feels like one of the most satisfying, original and enjoyable films in this year's LFF lineup: taking their cues from early Errol Morris, specifically 'Vernon, Florida', with little dashes of everyone from Mark Twain to Harmony Korine, the Rosses have created a dizzingly detailed, thoughtful, sympathetic but highly pragmatic celebration of the modern Midwest in all its beauty, complexity, stupidity and brilliance.

      <review><![CDATA[<p>An object lesson in how total creative freedom can leave a great director susceptible to his worst instincts, <i>Avatar</i> finds Cameron lost in his own obsessions. Twelve years after its release, <i>Titanic</i>
still stands as the ultimate in contemporary Hollywood
craftsmanshipthe work of a perfectionist whose attention to detail
extends to the trinkets and the matchbooks. None of that has changed: <i>Avatar</i>s
action is refreshingly clear, and the ballyhooed Navi world is a
masterwork of eye-popping design and sweeping camera moves, with a
degree of texture and dimensionality one wouldnt have presumed
possible.</p><p>As a demo reel, <i>Avatar</i> is phenomenal. But
while Cameron has fussed over the glow of every tentacle and wing tip,
the big-picture elements have gotten lost. The story, involving a
phlegmatic Marine (Worthington) who intervenes in colonizing forces
attempts to mine unobtainium on the distant moon Pandora, quickly
devolves into a rehash of <i>Dances with Wolves</i>. Making <i>Titanic</i>s
corny but absorbing romance look Pulitzer-worthy, the script consists
almost exclusively of dire boilerplate, while the cast members seem to
be vying with each other in an ongoing blandness contest.</p><p>The
human footagewhich resembles nothing so much as the full-motion video
games of the early 90sis distracting for its relative drabness.
(Theres a sense of actors constrained by having to hit their marks, to
make way for special effects.) And the various levels of allegoryin
which the peace-loving, preservationist Navi are eventually equated
with Iraqi insurgentscompete to the point of incoherence. Cameron once
again proves hes a visionary, but the mythmaker who gave us <i>The Terminator</i> remains MIA.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Back in the 1990s, Disney ruled the animated roost with a curious
fusion of old-fashioned storytelling and Broadway-esque tunes. With <i>The Princess and the Frog</i>, Disney goes back to the old formula, this time with Randy Newman composing the songs. <i>Princess</i>
is pleasantly nostalgic, with a few gentle winks at Disney past (little
girls obsessed with being princesses) and some catchy tunes. You wont
have the Pixar wow feeling; instead, youll get something comfortably
familiar. </p><p>Tiana (Anika Noni Rose), whom Disney has been trumpeting as its
first African-American heroine, dreams of opening her own restaurant,
but along the way she gets tangled up with a visiting prince (Bruno Campos)
who has been turned into a frog by a voodoo priest. When Tiana also
gets turned into a frog, they set out to find an old woman who can
reverse the spell. Though the animators take the soft-focus-background
style too far, the film generally looks great in the way that
hand-animated films do. The writers tiptoe carefully through the
minefield of racial representation (Cajuns may have more to object to
here than African-Americans), and the story has just enough twists to
keep it fresh.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Football fans know that the blind side is the quarterbacks
vulnerable spot when hes scouring the field for a pass. Moviegoers
attuned to the metaphorical nature of film titles can guess, however,
that the phrase applies to more than just grid-irony in John Lee Hancocks
based-on-a-true-story parable. Societys blind side, you see, is where
impoverished, hulking African-American athlete Big Mike Oher (Quinton Aaron)
lived until plucky Southern mother Leigh Anne Touhy (Sandra Bullock) took him
in. (Tough-talking mamas from Tennessee: What cant they fix?) As for
the saving glories of the game, youve first got to suffer through an
hour of Big Mikes bleached-blond guardian angel dropping saintly
Hallmark platitudes. Youve changed his life, one character tells
Leigh Anne. No, she says, complete with elongated dramatic pause.
Hes changed mine. Garrggh! Just bring on the sports-movie clichs
already.</p><p>Its tempting to think this vanilla take on a stock
inspirational tale exists solely to make an expressionistic emotional
steamroller like <i>Precious</i> seem even more graceful than it is.
Or, more importantly, that the movie regards this at-risk youth as
nothing other than a vehicle for making suburban moms in the audience
feel better about themselves on the postscreening drive to Costco. Is
this some sort of white-guilt thing? a ready-made villain asks
rhetorically. Actually, no; its just blinkered middle-class pandering
at its most shameless.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Given that Alvin and chums originally started out in 1958 as a trio of high-pitched recording artists, its only right that this live-action squeakquel should begin with the furry little CG blighters wooing a concert crowd with a raucous Kinks cover. Unfortunately, its the films only highlight  if the sight of three annoying furballs murdering You Really Got Me can be considered a highlight.<br />Id like to think the filmmakers had a lengthy deliberation about a storyline, but I suspect they simply caught an episode of The X Factor and the recently released Bandslam and thought a premise involving a self-centred Alvin, a rival group of female chipmunks (The Chipettes) and a college talent contest would prove a mighty good wheeze. And, indeed, that might have been the case had the story any semblance of a story. Instead, what were offered is a succession of lifeless scenes punctuated by pratfalls that only a handful of kids in the audience found funny. Next.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Russia, 1910. In his old age, Leo Tolstoy has become so famous worldwide that the merest hint hes about to pop his clogs sends newsreel cameras gathering in anticipation. The real story though, as this slightly fusty drama elaborates, is unfolding inside the Tolstoy household, where the octogenerian writer (Christopher Plummer, authentically beardy) finds himself in the centre of a dispute over the valuable publishing rights to War and Peace. The Tolstoyan political movement  an organisation espousing his ideas on communal property to combat social injustice  sense a major funding opportunity should Tolstoy sign his best-known book over to their leader Chertkov (Paul Giamatti), yet Tolstoys aristocratic wife Sofya (Helen Mirren), having delivered him 13 children, is determined to fight her corner to the bitter end.<br />Idealism versus family ties makes for a potentially juicy set-to, yet its the historical detail which keeps this adaptation of Jay Parinis novel relatively intriguing, rather than merely stodgy. Writer-director Michael Hoffman is all reverence towards Tolstoy himself, but curiously supercilious towards the beliefs of the Tolstoyan movement, thus undermining the key subplot (eager young acolyte James McAvoy gets his dream job as the great mans secretary, but must also spy on him) and unfairly loading the central conflict in favour of ferocious spouse Mirren. Her impressively projected performance becomes the dominating factor, causing Plummer to overdo it, and sidelining both the earnestly wet McAvoy and moustache-twirling Giamatti. Engaging performers all, but the movies superficial flummery is slightly exasperating when the true-life events would have provided an even richer palette of ideas.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[Movies about country musicians tend to go one of two ways. First, there are those inspired by true events, films like Coal Miners Daughteror Walk the Line, which explore the rise of a legend: all one-room shacks, abusive parents and acres of gingham. Then there are stories inspired by the songs themselves: tales of hardship and loss, redemption and self-discovery, saloon bars, acoustic guitars and gallons of sippin whisky.<br />Crazy Heart falls squarely into the latter bunch. Jeff Bridges plays Bad Blake, a one-time Nashville big hitter reduced to touring Midwestern dives picking up loose change and loose women, his livelihood in even worse shape than his liver. That is, until two events conspire to turn his sinking ship around: a relationship with Maggie Gyllenhaals Jean promises the kind of unflinching affection and familial grounding Blake badly needs, and a gig writing songs for one-time protg-turned-megastar Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) provides a much-needed jolt for his career.<br />In purely story terms this is by-the-numbers stuff, ticking all the expected boxes about redemption and renewal. But writer-director Scott Coopers trick is to turn that predictability into a strength: like a song youve heard a thousand times but which never fails to tug the heartstrings, Crazy Heart feels familiar, even comforting, offering few surprises but a wealth of lovingly crafted, immaculately judged, wholly authentic emotion.<br />The emotion is there in the soundtrack put together by Cooper and producing legend T-Bone Burnett, with new songs by Burnett and Ryan Bingham sitting perfectly alongside obvious inspirations like Townes van Zandt and Waylon Jennings. Its also in Coopers solid direction: despite his inexperience, he never falls prey to flashy first-time director syndrome, confident that his screenplay and cast will carry him through.<br />And its in those remarkable central performances: Bridges has already earned an Oscar nomination, but its impossible to overstate how much his honest, unabashed performance  part The Dude, part Kris Kristofferson  grounds the film. Hes backed by a sympathetic Gyllenhaal, making magic from a potentially thankless role, and a convincing turn from Farrell as the preening bigshot in cowboy clothes. But best of all is Robert Duvall, who essentially defined the subgenre with Tender Mercies back in 1983, and whose quiet, deeply felt turn as a bar owner reminds us of his undimmed but underused talent.<br />A shame, then, that the movie falls at the final hurdle with a series of crude, convenient feelgood twists, leading to an abrupt, unconvincing finale. If Cooper and his cast hadnt done their work so well, hadnt made us care so deeply for these fractured souls, maybe it wouldnt matter. As it is, Crazy Heart is only two-thirds a great movie: but like the song says, that aint bad.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Imagine a skit from <i>Robot Chicken</i> spun out to 75 minutes and youve got a pretty good idea what youre in for with <i>A Town Called Panic</i>.
Using little plastic toy figurines, clay and a lot of handmade props,
Aubier and Patar go on a manic free-associative jaunt about a horse, a
cowboy and an Indian who live together (Dont go into some weird sex
panic: The horse is a sort of mature father figure, and the cowboy and
Indian are like a pair of eight-year-olds). The celebration of the
horses birthday triggers a wild set of adventures involving mysterious
aquatic brick thieves, a giant mechanical penguin, a flirtatious lady
horse and assorted explosions and chases.</p><p>Theres something
rather admirable about directors Stphane Aubier and Vincent Patars ability to tap into the
hyperactive creative mentality of an eight-year-old (complete with
annoying character voices the makers of <i>South Park</i> would kill for). Unfortunately, though <i>A Town Called Panic</i>
is meticulously detailed, its frantic and occasionally grating, like
listening to that eight-year-old spin a story out for more than an
hour. Kudos for the purity of the filmmakers vision, but we cant say
we enjoyed watching it.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[We may have moved from veiled Cold War to explicit global terror in the 25 years since the excellent, UK-set nuclear conspiracy thriller Edge of Darkness first aired on the BBC, directed by Martin Campbell (Casino Royale) and written by Troy Kennedy Martin. Its also been some eight, traumatic post-9/11 years since Mel Gibsons last thespian outing in M Night Shyamalans Signs. But time seems to have stood still in Campbells drab remake for the big screen. With its nuclear concerns and old-fashioned heroics, it feels like a period piece.<br />In condensing the original mini-series into a conventional, two-hour package, scriptwriters William Monahan and Andrew Bovell have sadly sacrificed some of the originals cultural specificity and its slow-burn quality. Moreover, in relocating from northern England to the USs Eastern Seaboard, they have jettisoned much of the chilling atmospherics. Craven, the widowed police officer whose engineer daughter (Bojana Novakovic) is gunned down on a home visit, is now one of Boston PDs finest; and if its true that Gibson, in the role, recalls the earnest intensity and investigative zeal of Bob Pecks original performance, he also brings a lot of unwanted Lethal Weapon-era manic mannerisms to the part.<br /><br />Its basically a little guy against the system movie, literally so in many of Campbells framings  for instance, where he miniaturises Gibsons now slightly wizened figure against the looming bulk of Danny Hustons smarmy corporate bad guy. However, Ray Winstone, as a boozy high-level fixer in pointed contrast to Cravens ginger-ale-drinking sobriety, does offer good value in what is otherwise a surprisingly low-wattage and anonymously directed thriller. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Tim Burtons part-live action, part-animated, all-3D version of Alice in Wonderland is a collage of characters and episodes from Lewis Carrolls two nineteenth-century books about a girl who falls into the rabbit hole of her own imagination. But purists beware: Burton and his writer, Disney regular Linda Woolverton (The Lion King), invent a quest narrative  Alice must slay the Jabberwocky!  that climaxes in a pedestrian battle for which Alice puts aside dresses and channels Joan of Arc. Moreover, our heroines loopy headtrip begins with her fleeing a very public marriage proposal with the twenty-first-century excuse, I need a moment<br />This is a loose, enjoyable and safe spin on the books, with familiar characters doing familiar things within the altered  and digitised  framework of an older Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returning underground to find the Red Queen (a fun Helena Bonham Carter, actually playing a conflation of the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts) ruling a depressed land. <br />The problem with this downtrodden version of Wonderland is that it doesnt always sit well with the mania of Carrolls creations, and when we see a brighter flashback of the Red Queen painting roses, we wish we were in that world. Imagine the Cheshire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), the wise Caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman) and the Mad Hatter (an underwhelming, repetitive Johnny Depp) all doing their thing in the forests of Avatars Pandora after a long bout of acid rain and you begin to get the picture. Much of the colour has been sucked out and replaced with dark skies and long faces.<br />Yet much of Carrolls magical nonsense remains, even if Burtons film wobbles at the gates of anarchy and ends up being a more average affair than many might expect. Its also one in which the inventive costumes and individual flights of animated fancy end up being more memorable than the thin characters and half-hearted 3D rendering. As its Burton at the helm, you could call it gothic. The less generous might just call it gloomy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[According to this new Disney comedy, the daily grind of a tooth fairy is weirdly similar to that of Father Christmas, as seen in 1994s The Santa Clause. It involves lots of lying to your family, a bit of self-discovery and a lot of pratfalling and wailing like a loon. Dwayne The Rock Johnson treads water as Derek, an ageing hockey star slumming in the lower leagues after an injury whose trick is to come on at the end of the game and smash his opponents teeth in, hence the nickname Tooth Fairy. Living as a bachelor but making solid ground with a divorcee played by Ashley Judd, Derek is charged with two weeks actual tooth-fairy duty after he selfishly reveals to his girlfriends daughter how the money really ends up under the pillow. Apart from being poorly constructed and only mildly amusing, the film suggests that a child would rather believe that the whole tooth-fairy operation is run from a ruthless mercantile trading floor in the sky than merely be consoled by the possibility that it all just happens. Everything about the film feels like the product of a calculating mind, right down to the bit where Judds teenage son makes the bizarre proclamation that its his dream to scale the epic rock-star heights of Eric Clapton, or failing that, Stevie Ray Vaughan. The one element that lifts this above utter tedium is the presence of Stephen Merchant as tooth-fairy administrator Tracy. That he manages to come away with his dignity intact is testament to his skill as a comedian.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Anyone heading to the cinema this February 14 will find themselves conspicuously catered for by this romantic comedy from veteran Garry Marshall (Pretty Woman, Beaches). Throwing out a net to everyone from back-row teenage saliva-swappers to seasoned seniors, the film feels like it has been coldly calculated to hoover up demographics. How? Marshall gives his rom-com the Robert Altman Short Cuts treatment: an enormous megawatt ensemble cast appear in a dozen or so interlocking lurve stories that play out on Valentines Day in Los Angeles. Its supremely efficient and utterly ruthless.<br />There are 19 all-star names above the title (in alphabetical order, naturally) but the lead belongs to Ashton Kutcher. A nice-guy florist, he proposes to his work-addict girlfriend (Jessica Alba), but is obviously much better suited to his teacher best friend (Jennifer Garner). Jessica Biel (is it me, or are the Jessicas interchangeable?) plays a neurotically single sports publicist. Anne Hathaway, an office temp who moonlights as a phone sex operator (little nod to Short Cuts there), hasnt told her new boyfriend about the sideline. Shirley MacLaine, happily married for 50 years, is keeping an old secret from her husband. In what reeks of final-draft add-on, country star Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner from The Twilight Saga pair up as school sweethearts: no actual storyline here, but they tick the pre-teen box big time.<br /><br />These are sassily-scripted but glossy, vacuous fantasies  with the exception of Julia Robertss army captain, whos on short leave from Iraq and meets a guy (Bradley Cooper) on a plane: after some sparky but non-committal flight banter they go their separate ways and both their tales resolve with unexpectedly lovely flourishes. Their stories make the rest of the film look like its got a cold, shiny cash register right where its heart should be.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>On a South Carolina beach, a reticent G.I. Joe (Tatum) on temporary leave meets a rich girl (Seyfried), and the duo instantly ignites sparksNicholas Sparks, that is. Another achingly earnest adaptation from one of the chick-lit superstars formulaic weepies (<i>The Notebook, A Walk to Remember), Chocolat </i>director Lasse Hallstrms tastefully old-fashioned melodrama has exactly one objective: yanking gallons of cathartic tears out of your face by any means necessary.</p><p>After several heart-swelling weeks togetherwith a turgidly shot make-out session in the rain forever binding our young lovebirdsthe two vow to reunite after the soldiers tour of duty ends, leaving the art of letter writing to stoke their flames of passion. As they barely know each other (meaning ditto for us), however, insincere proclamations about their skin-deep chemistry, as read in voiceover, probably arent enough to lube the eyes. Which doesnt mean <i>Dear John</i> is without a few wet-duct tricks up its sleeve: Theres more autism, cancer, 9/11 shocks and bittersweet heartbreak here than you can shake a hankie at. Sometimes the leads pull off genuine tenderness, and other times their gauzily written caricatures cant elevate such overwrought housewife bait, but chances are, given its literary pedigree, most viewers are preordained to love or loathe it.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The original title of the Stieg Larsson novel which became, in translation, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was Men Who Hate Women: a blunt but fitting description of this angry, intelligent but curiously uninvolving Swedish shaggy dog story. The film sees down-at-heel, crusading journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) hired by industrialist Henrik Vanger to look into the disappearance of his beloved niece more than 30 years before. Blomkvists quest is intercut with the story of Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), a bisexual ex-con cyberpunk computer hacker (only in Sweden!) at the mercy of a corrupt, sexually deviant parole officer.<br />Throughout this beautifully photographed, skilfully constructed film theres a sense were skimming lightly over Larssons characters and themes. Blomkvist is the putative hero, but his investigative journey is a little too familiar, his character too clean-cut to be compelling. Its Salander who holds the attention: superbly played by Rapace, shes a grim, spectral presence in the opening scenes, before shes pushed too far and explodes in a moment of shocking, vengeful violence.<br /><br />Such scenes place The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo above the extended TV mystery it easily could have become, but explicit violence only takes you so far. At heart this is a traditional thriller, down to a series of convenient and underwhelming last-act revelations. For fans of Larssons books this could be the highlight of the cinemagoing year  for the rest of us its a solid, enjoyable but emotionally unengaging detective story.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[Were so used to amped-up white-knucklers that the controlled approach of a filmmaker like Roman Polanski is immediately seductive. The director responsible for such mainstays as <i>Chinatown</i> and <i>Rosemarys Baby</i> (and of course his own real-life news cycle) turns Robert Harriss political potboiler involving a ghostwriter (McGregor), a former British prime minister (Brosnan) and an isolated island home into a slow-burn near-masterpiece. Shot in claustrophobic widescreen, the film showcases Polanskis mastery of even expository scenes: A revealing conversation between McGregors so-called ghost and a shady figure played by Tom Wilkinson is so fraught with tension that you expect those malevolent Cocteau-esque hands from<i> Repulsion</i> to burst out of the wall and drag someone into oblivion. <br />The film stays more grounded than that, though it certainly doesnt lack for perverse Polanski flourishes. Theres a great bit of carnal business with the prime ministers wife (Williams) thats filmed in a deadpan long shot. Eli Wallach pops upfrail-looking though spiritedas an old-timer who stokes the writers paranoia about his employers plans for him. And more than one character has a wry aside on the protagonists heritage (Oh, you Brits!), as if it was both a badge of honor and a reason for condescending suspicion. <br />There are all number of similarly colorful touches (the sick-joke ending alone is worth the price of admission) that help to deepen what one colleague suggested is the greatest airport novel ever filmed. Its true that <i>The Ghost Writer</i> doesnt possess the lingering profundity of the directors best workthe War on Terror window dressing is just that. Yet Polanski has made a genre piece with a verve and vitality thats in sadly short supply. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Thirty-five years after Network and All the Presidents Men, in which journalists told uncomfortable truths and defended democracy, Green Zone makes military personnel do the noble work which craven reporters shirk. The only consolation is that the movie is inspired by a work of journalism, Rajiv Chandrasekarans Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraqs Green Zone.<br /><br />Set in Iraq in the months following the 2003 invasion, the film reunites the director and star of The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon; this time, however, we already know the details of the underhanded government action our hero confronts. Damon plays an army warrant officer whose WMD sorties keep coming up empty; unwilling to roll over, hes soon embroiled in a turf war between the CIA and the Pentagon (personified by conscientious Brendan Gleeson and oleaginous Greg Kinnear) while attempting to wrangle a Baathist general (Igal Naor), a useful veteran (Said Faraj) and a useless embedded reporter (Amy Ryan) against a backdrop of more-or-less real events.<br />Greengrasss approach to real-life disaster is far more simplified and pumped up here than it was in United 93 or Bloody Sunday, but theres much to be said for his Bourne in Baghdad approach. The action is robust, the politics simplified but strident, insisting that a wilfully under-prepped war worked against both US and Iraqi interests. By shifting focus from the naively doctrinaire civilians of Chandrasekarans book to street-level soldiers questioning authority, Greengrass concocts a formula with a fighting chance of dispelling the Curse of the Hollywood Iraq Movie. If a picture as conventionally accessible as Green Zone tanks, that campaign is surely lost.]]></review>

Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan are partners in law out to recover a stolen baseball card from some badass Hispanic gangsters. How we arrive at that golden nugget of a plot complication is something for the Robert McKees of the world to illuminate; for the rest of us, this is some soul-sapping dada with which director Kevin Smith is staining his already-dubious rsum.</p><p>The actors constantly indulge in unfocused improv: Morgan is given what feels like a full reel to unleash an unfunny succession of re-created film scenes, each followed by a reaction shot of Willis telling us what said scene is supposed to be (<i>Heat!; The Color Purple!</i>). The camera later fleetingly catches game supporting actor Kevin Pollak doing a spot-on De Niro impersonation, and its like seeing the difference between mastery and cacophony. Nearly all the jokes are spewed as if they were a barrage of bullets. Thats fitting, since this purported comedy is also senselessly violent: Guns are fired with reckless abandon. Blood is carelessly spilled. And amid all the carnage, were supposed to give a damn about whether Morgans wife is cheating on him and if Willis can give his daughter a dream wedding on a cops salary. Then theres the Seann William Scott stoner scenes, but, really, why prolong the torment? <br /></p>]]></review>

Suddenly, the slighted sibling discovers that hes the biological grandchild of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth. Welcome to an outrageous plot twist worthy of a Pedro Almodvar melodrama, but to paraphrase the title of an aborted Welles film: Its all true.</p><p><i>Prodigal Sons</i> is also a first-person testimonial, as documentarian Kimberly Reed films every uncomfortable moment with her brother Marc McKerrow, who wont relinquish their fraternal rivalry even though shes no longer a man. Welless longtime partner Oja Kodar invites them to an idyllic reunion in Croatia, which gives McKerrow a chance to recast his troubled existence and embrace his newfound ancestral fame. Instead, he immediately shames Reed by showing photos of her male past, offering a fascinating glimpse into how self-defining narratives inevitably ensure familial conflict.But instead of pushing deeper into any psychological dilemmas, this dirty-laundry doc gets lost in a sensationalistic flurry driven by a serious emotional unraveling. One particularly violent scene depicts McKerrows instability to an extent that robs him of any dignity, with Reeds narration crowding out his voice. Even when cinematically attempting to heal old wounds, the filmmaker cant help but have the last word.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[George Romeros original The Crazies was a prime slice of raw mid-70s exploitation schlock: scruffy, violent and politically edgy. Breck Eisners remake is slicker, prettier and dumber, but not entirely without merit. The cast is very strong: Timothy Olyphant exudes old-fashioned tough-guy charm as the small town sheriff whose constituents begin falling prey to a disease which turns them into bloodthirsty zombies, while Radha Mitchell provides credible if thankless support as his wife. Theres also an impressively high-strung turn from Joe Anderson (Peter Hook in Control) as a redneck cop on the brink.<br />But the film feels choppy and roughly edited, as though its makers were so keen to keep it short that they hacked out any scares, atmosphere or sense of impending dread. Theres too much story and key details are absent or underexplained. Though far from unwatchable, The Crazies feels like a missed opportunity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>A far cry from the gritty 70s policiers it conjures with cock-of-the-walk swagger (<i>Serpico, Prince of the City</i>), Antoine Fuquas second-rate retread of his own <i>Training Day</i> is a bloated, multithread drama concerning three burnt-out cops at the end of their seemingly unconnected ropes. Just a week away from receiving his pension, spiritually ruined man-in-blue Eddie (Gere) would rather let crime run rampant than do paperwork; he wakes up each morning to a glass of whiskey and a cocked gun in his mouth. Then theres Officer Tango (Cheadle), whose undercover duty has been so overextended that his loyalties and moral compass have shifted to protect his gangland pal Caz (Snipes). Yes, weve seen that type of hot mess before. And gee, will underpaid narcotics cop Sal (Hawke) ditch his few remaining scruples to make the down payment on a new house for his baby mama, pregnant with twins?</p><p>Across the board, the capable cast of <i>Brooklyns Finest</i> works hard to sell a soulful intensity, which isnt easy considering that each of the leads could proclaim theyre getting too old for this shit at any given moment. Unsubtly scripted by former NYC transit worker Michael C. Martin, the film plays like the inverse of <i>Crash</i>a faux-intricate exercise in crosscutting fatalism that points fingers at its characters rather than the audience. Rock bottom is never as close as it appears and what goes around comes around (and all that noise), but for a character-driven piece digging up old tropes about the strains of humanity buried within corrupted people, the constant threat of violence seems to be its only dramatic momentum.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hollywoods campaign to convince audiences that beefy Scots bulldog Gerard Butler can play the romantic lead gathers pace with this misjudged marital crime caper. Butler plays Milo Boyd, an ex-cop turned bail bondsman assigned to haul in his ex-wife Nicole (Jennifer Aniston), a hotshot reporter in deep with the law. The pursuit takes this pair of bickering exes from New York to Atlantic City and back, via a series of perfunctory car chases, poorly choreographed punch-ups and excruciating romantic entanglements.<br />The trouble is not so much that Butler isnt funny  he isnt, even slightly  but that he sucks the merest hint of humour from the entire enterprise. Even proven performers like Aniston and Christine Baranski as a sexually voracious mother-in-law are reduced to desperate mugging and hysterical arm-waving in an attempt to fill the comic vacuum which their muscular co-star leaves in his wake. To be fair, the script gives them little to work with: there are maybe three decent laughs, interspersed with long stretches of interminable, would-be witty banter and one near-unwatchable comedy torture scene. <br />The score, too, is atrocious: infuriatingly cheeky in the comedy scenes, switching to screeching Bon Jovi-esque AOR whenever things kick off. The Bounty Hunter isnt bad enough to be offensive: its simply lazy, trite, smug, irritating and a colossal waste of time, talent and money. Therell be worse films released in 2010  but not many.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Jay Baruchel is the gentlest of the Apatow geeklings, more a mascot to sweathogs like Seth Rogen than an equal. (His spindly boxer in <i>Million Dollar Baby</i> looked beatable by even Hilary Swank.) So it makes sense that Baruchels first star vehicle, a twitchy, frequently funny affair, emphasizes the scrawn factor: <i>Shes Out of My League</i> casts him as a polite Pittsburgh airport-security worker, Kirk, dwarfed by the epaulets on his uniform and the pushy advice of his man-gang. When a bombshell traveler, Molly (Eve), makes her way through the gate, shes seen as a human being only by Kirk, who returns her iPhone and boggles at the possibility of her being attracted to him.</p><p>You might feasibly expectindeed, hope forthis to play out like a zanier <i>Say Anything </i>(judging from Baruchels rawness, he does, too). But were hardly in that romantic ballpark; the promising material, penned by the writers of the underrated <i>Sex Drive,</i> skews closer to Farrelly brothers slapstick than sweetness. One gag involving a loving act of manscaping by a heterosexual friend will make you want to vomit; you sense that<i> The Hangover</i> loomed large over this production. Still, Eve has a true flair for zingers, and the movies heart survives intact. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Fathers know foolishness best in this culture-clash family comedy, which presides over a cursed union of slushy sentimentality and dim-witted humor. Two lovebirds (Gross, Ferrera) wreak havoc among their clans by announcing their intentions to marry. Such news is upsetting to their respective not-so-proud popsa playboy radio personality (Whitaker) and a clingy car restorer (Mencia)who immediately begin volleying racial and class-based insults at each other.<br /></p><p>Paternal bickering and egomaniacal prejudices soon give way to slapstick fighting, which in turn leads to clichd crises (the couple starts to reconsider their relationship, other relatives find love amid the matrimonial chaos) and Kumbaya reconciliations that are as predictable as the scripts intolerant slurs are tame. A variety of peripheral players fulfill the stereotype quota, with African-Americans represented as party-hearty lotharios and Mexicans cast as traditionalist kooks. Aside from an uncomfortable-looking Carlos Mencia, who seems to actively cower before the camera, the cast is robotically efficientthough thats not the same thing as coming out of this lifeless mess unscathed. Itll take years of yeomans work for Forest Whitaker to repair his onscreen reputation after allowing himself to be humped by a runaway goat hopped up on Viagra.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This years romantic heartthrob, R-Patz  Twilight star Robert Pattinson to those non-fanatics among you  has an executive-producer credit attached to this unobjectionable but slightly arch and sentimentalised 2001-set New York romantic drama. This may suggest an effort on his part to add thespian respect and some rebellious street-cred to his image. If so, he might have chosen a more subtle director than Allen Coulter (Hollywoodland, TVs Nurse Jackie, The Sopranos etc) and a better script than this clichd, strangely humourless effort by newcomer Will Fetters.Nevertheless, the all-important romantic mechanics work well enough. <br />The movies meet-cute occurs at the NYU canteen where conflicted rich kid Tyler (Pattinson) dare-dates overprotected, lone-parented Ally (petite star Emilie de Ravin from Lost) on the prompting of Tylers standard-issue flatmate and gooseberry, Aidan (Tate Ellington). Fate, family loss, father obsession and too much booze have brought them together: Allys cop dad (Chris Cooper, wasted) had previously banged up Tyler for a back-street brawl, which explains the cool-looking bruises the nice but nihilistic 21 year old sports throughout the movie  as well as the angry dads embargo and the curtailment of their brief idyll as the calendar turns fatefully towards September<br />Its a movie that craves much indulgence: Pattinson, playing handsome, mixed-up and misunderstood, is watchable enough but he aint no Olivier; while de Ravin bears her straitjacket role of pretty, sweet and wise with good grace. But, be warned, if youre vulnerable to outrageous, cringe-inducing implausibilities  not least the ludicrous stand-up row between Tyler and his father in the latters Twin Towers boardroom  youd best give this one a miss.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Theres no rule that says movie characters have to be likeable. In everything from Zoolander to Tropic Thunder, Ben Stiller has built a career on walking the fine line between playing the obnoxiously neurotic and haplessly loveable, pushing the viewer to the edge of disgust before reeling them back in for a touchy-feely finale. But as the hero of Greenberg, his first straight role in years, Stiller has finally decided to cut the audience loose altogether: this guys just a creep.<br />Whether we are supposed to think so remains in doubt. Hes certainly pitiable: recently released from a mental institution following a nervous collapse, fortysomething musician-turned-carpenter Roger Greenberg heads to LA to housesit for his brothers family, who are on holiday. While there, he meets the familys dog-walker and general dogsbody Florence (Greta Gerwig), whose recent run of romantic bad luck has left her vulnerable to the kind of spiky, self-pitying patter Greenberg specialises in.<br />As the tentative relationship between Roger and Florence develops, Greenberg becomes a film of shifting sympathies, though not to the extent that director Noah Baumbach and his co-author (and bit-player) Jennifer Jason Leigh seem to think it is. In The Squid and the Whale Baumbach proved himself adept at subtle emotional manipulation, and there are moments where we feel for Roger  one remarkable, edgy scene where he crashes a teen house party in a desperate attempt to relive his lost youth hints at the movie this could have been if wed been encouraged to identify just a little more closely with this shambling, self-involved loser.<br />It might also have helped if Baumbach hadnt cast such a note-perfect leading lady, but Gerwig is a pure pleasure, so tender, tentative and compassionate that it only makes us hate Greenberg all the more as he sweeps in and out of her life and her bed, taking her for granted. This deserves to be the role that breaks Gerwig into the big time, but we can only dream of what might have been had she been given centre stage.<br />And so Greenberg remains a film of powerful, memorable moments  some striking dialogue, some great performances, a handful of beautifully played, bracingly discomfiting love scenes  in search of a structure and, perhaps, a soul. One cant help admiring Baumbach and Stiller for refusing to bow to tradition and soften the impact of this abrasive character, but its equally impossible to shake the impression that Greenberg, both the character and the movie, is more interested in rubbing us up the wrong way than getting to the heart of things.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For the past year, 3D has been a guarantee of box-office gold, as proven by the runaway success of Avatar. But now, for the first time, a film arrives for which the 3D element may prove to be a commercial hindrance. Its not only that Clash of the Titans will compete with Alice in Wonderland, How to Train Your Dragon and Avatar for the nations 3D screens. More critically than that, the film's conversion to 3D (a decision taken late in the filmmaking process) has rendered this campy, unashamedly old-school but still highly enjoyable blockbuster rather painful to watch.<br />In story terms, Clash of the Titans doesn't stray too far from the beloved 1981 Ray Harryhausen classic which spawned it. The setting is mythical Ancient Greece  an age of Gods, monsters and muscular men in little chainmail skirts. Sam Worthington is Perseus, an orphaned demi-God drawn into the battle between man and the immortals when Hades (Ralph Fiennes), lord of the underworld, threatens to unleash his great sea-beast, the Kraken, on the city of Argos. Accompanied by a ragtag band of warriors, Perseus sets off to learn the secrets of the Kraken and end the reign of the Gods once and for all.<br />Theres no ignoring the fact that Clash of the Titans is a mess: the plot is episodic and rushed, the dialogue blunt and occasionally laughable, and there are far too many characters, few of whom leave much of an impression. Both Worthington and love interest Gemma Arterton look like theyre on a strenuous Aegean package holiday, but luckily theyre surrounded by the likes of Fiennes, Pete Postlethwaite and Liam Neeson as Zeus, whose commanding, armour-clad presence seems, at times, to be the only thing holding this crumbling edifice together.<br />Other notable names dont fare so well: Danny Huston gets a mighty fake beard but just one line as sea-God Poseidon, Mads Mikkelsen does little more than bare his teeth as burly swordsman Draco and, most egregiously, Jason Flemyng gets a terrific backstory and some superb melting-face makeup as ruined ruler Calibos  and that's it. It's is a recurring problem throughout the film: with dialogue and character motivation cut back to the bare minimum, theres no way for anyone to express themselves except through action.<br />But, luckily, this is where Clash of the Titans succeeds. Whatever the flaws in the script, theres no faulting director Louis Leterriers visual ambition: this is a film of mighty vistas, beautifully designed beasts and intense, well-structured combat sequences, all rendered in eye-popping, though still rather fake-looking, CGI. Taking the lessons of The Lord of the Rings to heart, Leterrier goes all-out for excess: his computer-generated camera soars above sprawling cities, endless deserts and blasted underworld hellscapes, lending the film a dizzying, epic scale.<br />A shame, then, that the addition of 3D has rendered much of this grandeur all but unwatchable, blurring the image to a headache-inducing degree and adding absolutely nothing to a film which was obviously shot in two dimensions and should have stayed that way. As an experiment in high-Hollywood style over substance, Clash of the Titans is a very entertaining ride. But take our advice: sidestep the 3D and see it the old fashioned way. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Wasnt it only yesterday that Dakota Fanning shrieked her way into your splitting headache in <i>War of the Worlds</i>? She was just 11 back then, and in this fast-and-loose dramatization of the flameout of the 1970s proto-grrrl group, shes all of 15. Fannings costar, vamp bait Kristen Stewart, isnt that much more experienced (she can vote). The two make for an uncomfortably tarted-up frontline as, respectively, blond yowler Cherie Currie and future-bad-reputation-disregarder Joan Jett. Its exactly as it should be; the bands story is a cautionary one. So if you feel yourself getting protective, the movie is doing its job.</p><p>The two underage characters meet, naturally, in a bar over drinks, shoved together by creepy L.A. entrepreneur Kim Fowley (<i>Revolutionary Road</i>s Shannon, the only truly anarchic presence in the whole film). Soon enough, theyre crammed into a motor home with the rest of the band, working on chord ch-ch-changes and sliding inexorably toward drugs, soft-core lesbian sex and Japanese fame. As styled by video director Floria Sigismondi, the film mainly glances on these surfacesits more giggly goofy than coke-in-the-bathroom naughty. (Only vinyl collectors will insist that a serious legacy has been sullied; the plot is as contrived as the group itself.)So you dont blink an eye when the prefab wheels run off the railstheres very little pathos here for something presumably informed by Curries 1989 memoir. Still, you do get a sense of the moment when glam was being fought out in American high schools, and teen sex was barely contained in tight pants. Theres lots of volume in these tunesthe soundtrack is killerand at least everyone gets their rocks off. <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Who would think that a sleepy seaside snippet of the Bronx could foster a Faulkner novels worth of family skeletons? Vince Rizzo (Garcia) is a prison warden guarding two big secrets from his family: a moonlighting stint as an aspiring actor, and Tony (Strait), a grown son from a past fling who shows up as an inmate. Our guilt-ridden everyman takes probationary custody of his close-relations convict, setting off a chain of mishaps: Tony proceeds to make eyes at both Vinces wife (Margulies) and his teen daughterwhos secretly stripping to pay for collegewhile urging Vinces teen son to indulge his online fetish for obese women.</p><p>Somehow, writer-director Raymond De Felitta pulls off these proceedings way better than anyone has a right to, thanks to his light touch with potentially lurid plot developments and his generosity in letting actors flesh out their sitcom setups. Strait, a heartthrob in the making, almost steals the film from Garcia, who channels outer-borough local affably, if a bit thickly. Theres an inevitable clusterfuck climax of accumulated secrets that explode into histrionics, but what precedes the heavily accented sturm und drang is handled with delightful deft.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its a time-honoured tradition among ageing rock stars with dwindling audiences to go back to the time that made them famous: nostalgia sells.<br /><br />Now John Cusack is applying the same shtick to movies: having tried his luck as both action hero and romantic lead, with Hot Tub Time Machine, Cusack returns to the slapdash, high concept 80s comedies that made him famous. And concepts dont come much higher than this: following a mysterious incident with an outdoor Jacuzzi and a can of nuclear-powered Russian energy drink, Adam (Cusack) and his three friends find themselves rocketed into the past, forced to relive the craziest night of their teenage lives before they can find a way back to the good old twenty-first century.<br />Hot Tub Time Machine conforms a little too closely to the post-The Hangover comedy template of a gang of drunk middle-aged losers with loud voices, bad attitudes and dubious ideas about women. But where this film scores over The Hangover is in the script, which replaces brash overconfidence with a looser narrative structure and a shaggier, more playful sense of humour.<br />It also does a great job of recreating the style and content of the 80s comedies it so lovingly pastiches, namely girls with big hair, pounding synth music and skisuit-wearing preppy douchebag villains. Giving his most charming performance in years, Cusack keeps the film sweet-natured when his more outrageous co-star Rob Corddry threatens to go overboard. No masterpiece, perhaps, but Hot Tub Time Machine is post-pub perfection.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The 3D bandwagon keeps rolling with this smart, muscular, animated adventure. On a remote North Atlantic island, the Viking population is suffering harassment from swarms of marauding dragons, until geeky son-of-a-chief Hiccup finds an injured dragon in the woods and suspects this constant state of warfare may be unnecessary.<br />Rejecting the comic whimsy of Cressida Cowells source novel, How to Train Your Dragon is a surprisingly robust affair, backing its juggernaut narrative with a well-judged and timely political subtext which urges young viewers to question received wisdom and make up their own minds, especially when it comes to matters of life and death. The voices can be jarring  the burly adult Vikings are all Scots, while their offspring are whiny Yanks  and the characterisation remains disappointingly old fashioned and unoriginal. But the visuals are striking, the script sharp and well paced and it all wraps up with a breathtaking aerial battle sequence.]]></review>

Forget it  this nasty non-thriller shares nothing but a similar title with Alex Coxs nutty 1984 head trip through LA, and mores the pity. Here, were in that gone-to-pot near-future so beloved of filmmakers, where Law and Whitaker (pictured) are pals and colleagues working in a debt-recovery department with a difference: they recover human organs. The film pitches friend against friend as Law ends up with a new ticker and darts about town with fellow post-op target Alice Braga in tow. Ideas, excitement and logic are ditched in favour of blood and gore  and theres no fun to be had watching operations and knife fights. Law and Whitaker are disastrous in the lead roles. Its a dreary and violent film that betrays its three years spent on the shelf.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Alongside last months <i>Repo Men</i>, <i>The Joneses</i>
belongs in a group of better-living satires that lack a grasp of
rudimentary economics. To give away no more than the press materials
do: Say you dressed up a group of actors as a fake family, giving each
one a set of products to hawk over several months. How much would you
pay them? How many items could they sell relative to that price? How
long could you keep it up before your company went bust (or at least
got buried in union grievances)?</p><p>Set in an alternate universe
where viral marketing seems to have never harnessed the power of the
Internet, this amusing but benign send-up outdoes <i>The Truman Show</i> in sheer quaintness (and makes <i>The Stepford Wives</i>
look edgy). Needless to say, not all is paradise when Demi Moores sales
unit (dad David Duchovny, along with kids Amber Heard and Ben Hollingsworth) moves
into a McSuburb and begins to show off its golf clubs and reheated
gourmet food, which the neighbors immediately purchase in kind. Theres
no such thing as the perfect family, and conscience often comes into
conflict with capitalism: Unless these are revelations, <i>The Joneses</i>
is an exercise in inevitability, with a late-breaking development that
suggests a classic case of a screenwriter seeking a hasty exit. Moore
and Duchovny are more likable than theyve been in some time. The movie
theyre in, however, may inspire buyers remorse.</p>]]></review>

But while Dear John had capable, charismatic leads, The Last Song stars a guy from Neighbours (Liam Hemsworth) and Hannah Montana (aka Miley Cyrus). Hemsworth is not so bad, but Cyrus doesnt convince, believing a toothy pout is a catch-all for any emotion but happiness. And her character pouts a lot: teenage Ronnie is sulking with her father (Greg Kinnear) while spending a summer at his beachhouse. Her parents have split, so shes wearing a lot of black, but she starts brushing her hair when local hunk Will (Hemsworth) comes on the scene. As a chaste romance ensues, things are enlivened by 13-year-old Bobby Coleman as Ronnies brother: a cute, characterful kid, hes the one wholl get you laughing and blubbing. Anyone but Cyrus fans will find this one of the more inferior Sparks adaptations  and yes, that includes Nights in Rodanthe.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Click here to read our interview with the director of 'Mid-August Lunch'</p><p>Its no secret that many Italian men stay at home with mamma until they get married, or at least until mamma finally kicks them out into the big, bad world. But this low-key Italian charmer, which is more of a touching, humorous short story than a fully fleshed novel, takes that idea to extreme lengths. Writer-director Gianni Di Gregorio (one of the writers on last years Gomorrah, but dont expect any guns here) plays Gianni, a placid Roman in his fifties who lives with his elderly mum Valeria (Valeria De Franciscis), a refined 80 year old who always looks like shes dressed for dinner at the Ritz back in 1963.<br /><br />This loving pair live in a comfortable city-centre apartment, surrounded by good furniture and knickknacks accumulated over many years, but we know they have little cash as the manager of their building comes knocking, wondering when theyre going to pay their service charges. In place of a cheque, Gianni agrees to look after the managers mother for the weekend. However, when the mother, Grazia, turns up, she has another relative, Maria, in tow. Within hours, Gianni has also agreed to take care of Marina, his doctors mother, which means hell be spending the mid-August holiday (ferragosto) in the company of four women with a combined age of around 350.<br /><br />Its a bit of a stretch to call this a comedy, even though it puts a warm grin on your face from beginning to end. The real beauty of the film lies in how Di Gregorio quietly realises the relationships between Gianni and the four women. These ladies might need a bit of looking after, but they still like to talk about boys, eat good food and even, in one case, wander off in the middle of the night for a furtive drink.<br /><br />Underlying this amiable, thoughtful film is an assumption that age should bring with it respect  and however exasperated he gets, Gianni abides by this code completely. Oddly, the film reminded me a little of Curb Your Enthusiasm, partly because Gianni, with his silly domestic horse-trading, comes across as a much kinder incarnation of Larry David and partly because it shares a freewheeling concern for the absurdity of the everyday, such as when Gianni has to buy food from a local fisherman to feed his unexpected guests. But this is very much a real and warm enterprise, not least because Di Gregorio extracts such lovely performances from his elderly cast. A treat.</p><p>Click here to read our interview with the director of 'Mid-August Lunch' <br /></p>]]></review>

wasteland, you can probably fill in a lot of the blanks: a loner who
walks through the desert, bands of cannibals, rumors of a place thats
green. You know the drill. Its all there in <i>The Book of Eli</i>,
with an overlay of Christian theology, or at least fetishistic
obsession with what may be the last remaining copy of the Bible, thrown
in for good measure. For what it is, its pretty entertaining.</p><p>Those
expecting a lot of action may grumble about the Hughes brothers focus
on ambiance. Sure, Bible-reading wanderer Eli (Washington) unleashes
some mad killing skills. <i>Book of Eli</i> doesnt have the deep attention to the details of post-disaster decay of, say, <i>I Am Legend</i> (<i>Book of Eli</i>s
wasteland is pretty generic), but the Hughes brothers know how to work
a mood and get good performances out of all the players, which is no
small feat in this sort of movie. </p><p>The religious aspects of Gary
Whittas screenplay get a bit overbearing at times, and the last 20
minutes could have been tightened up a bit, but on the whole, this is a
hell of a lot better than most of the post-apocalyptic thrillers weve
seen lately.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Tarantino detractors like to claim he takes nothing seriously, but
even at his most referential, he remains invested in such niceties as
dialogue and character. Thats not the case with his imitators movies,
and <i>Kick-Ass</i>which sometimes plays like <i>Kill Bill</i> without <i>Volume 2</i>s
moral convolutionsis further proof that comic books dont necessarily
make good films. (The source is a 2008 Marvel series by Mark Millar.)
Like <i>Sin City</i>, <i>Kick-Ass</i>
is stylized within an inch of its life, a would-be cross between Mickey
Spillane and John Hughes. (In this florid context, even Cages lunacy
seems normal.) The hero is an ordinary dweeb (Johnson) who throws on a
costume and calls himself a superhero. But the movie never seems
particularly invested in either his adventures or his romantic
frustrations; its an object lesson in the point at which irony crosses
over into nihilism.</p><p>Still, <i>Kick-Ass</i> gains significant
momentum in its second half, once it abandons the arch origin-story
material and starts staking a claim as a straight-up action flick. This
is mainly because it cedes the stage to the hilariously foul-mouthed
and violent Hit Girl (the 13-year-old Moretza star is born), a fellow
vigilante tasked with taking down a skyscraper full of goons. A little
inventively choreographed mayhem goes a long way. Give Hit Girl her own
sequel and there may be some genuine kick-assery indeed.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Hyped at Torontos Midnight Madness sidebar as the next frontier in vampire movies, <i>Daybreakers</i> feels only slightly less anemic than an <i>Underworld</i>
sequel. This Australian-produced horror film boasts exactly one
intriguing idea: It takes place in a future world where vampires
outnumber humans, which means the food supply is shrinking, fast. In
the kind of speculative sci-fi invention that <i>Daybreakers</i>
could have used more of, we watch as vampire commuters at a coffee cart
complain about the diluted blood in their Styrofoam cups.</p><p>On the
verge of developing a kind of synthetic blood, a vampire hematologist
(Hawke) winds up in an unlikely alliance with a rogue band of humans,
who may have found an antidote to vampirism. (Dafoe, crossbow in hand,
appears in his most blatant paycheck role since <i>Speed 2</i>.)
With a set of supernatural ground rules that only a screenwriter could
love, they take on the vampire overclass, ruled by an arch and
self-amused CEO (Sam Neill). If most of this seems familiar, thats because
the best elements have been covered in more exciting movies: The
vampire camaraderie and reverse-conversion themes echo those in Kathryn
Bigelows magisterial <i>Near Dark</i> (1987), and the corporate satire feels like a pale shadow of that in George Romeros <i>Land of the Dead</i> (2005). Long before the end credits rise, <i>Daybreakers</i> has exhausted its novelty.</p>]]></review>

on the small screen, has to get Anistoned out of a proper Hollywood

isnt going to alter this conundrumit makes you laugh in fits and
starts, but more often it feels toothless and exhausted, the kind of
project that exists to give Ray Liotta work. (The generic script is by <i>Shrek</i>-sequel
scribe Josh Klausner.) Fey is almost perfectly paired with Steve Carell as
bored, married New Jerseyites Claire and Phil: The way they trade quips
and cast snide aspersions at strangers, the actors seem totally
believable as intellectual mates and, more crucially, deeply in danger
of losing intimacy. After stealing a reservation at a clichd-snobby
NYC eatery, the couple are mistaken for blackmailers and pursued by
goons, <i>North by Northwest</i>style, throughout the city.</p><p>You

move them out of the most excellent roommates category. When Mark Wahlberg
shows up as a shirtless tech-heavy spyone who can also flirt in
Hebrewhe almost constitutes a joke in himself. But cant there at
least be faster fish for Fey and Carell to shoot in the barrel?</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The story was already old-fashioned in 1948: budding prima ballerina Victoria (Moira Shearer) finds herself torn between the divergent demands of art and heart, as represented by two equally headstrong men  tortured control freak and impresario Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) and lovelorn composer Julian (Marius Goring). When they put aside their differences and collaborate, they produce work of awe-inspiring beauty, but ultimately the simmering tension between them leads to tragedy.<br /></p><p>The realisation that were in the presence of genius comes just a few minutes into The Red Shoes, as a gaggle of eager balletomanes take their places for the inaugural performance of Lermontovs latest masterpiece. They settle into their seats, the roar around them fades, a cheery onscreen ticker reads 45 minutes later, and Michael Powell moves us forward in time without even breaking the shot.These quietly radical directorial flourishes can be found throughout the film and Powells entire canon  but what sets this greatest of all British filmmakers apart from the competition is his refusal to thrust his genius in the audiences face, subsuming his natural showmans flair to the demands of story and character. <br />Until the time comes to cut loose, at which point Powell unleashes the most eyepopping visual extravaganza imaginable. Blending impressionist art and expressionist film, blurring the barriers between theatre and cinema, body and camera, reality and dream, drawing equally on the avant-garde and the classical, the centrepiece ballet is a sequence of sheer, reckless transcendence. Its here that The Red Shoes becomes more than the sum of its hoary old parts, taking flight as the crowning glory of our national cinema.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Over the years, <i>The Godfather</i> has become so deeply entrenched in the culture that its a challenge to see it with fresh eyes. I made him an offer he couldnt refuse; Brando scratching his cheek with his pinky; crosscutting between a christening and the elimination of the Corleones enemies; Pacinos transformation from outsider to head of the family. Its all been praised so lavishly that one cant imagine the film living up to its reputation.</p><p>And yet, it does. From the haunting opening momentsan undertaker appeals to Don Vito Corleone (Brando) for justice, both of them enveloped in darkness so rich you could cut off slices of itCoppola demonstrates absolute control of his material. He and cinematographer Gordon Willis knew the look they wanted, even tweaking the film-development process to up the red and yellow in the final print (giving the film its rich, almost sepia look). It doesnt hurt, of course, that Coppola has a cast thats an embarrassment of riches. Yes, Brando is amazing, but so is everyone. Its worth watching secondary players like Abe Vigoda, Richard S. Castellano and Sterling Hayden, all of whom have great moments. Of course, its hard to find a moment in the film that isnt great. <i>The Godfather</i> lives up to the term <i>masterpiece</i>. </p>]]></review>

Wouldnt you know, the mislabeled drugs fall into innocent hands, and soon a normally mild-mannered mourner (Tudyk) is doing the usual kooky things that people on drugs do in comedies aimed at people whove never done drugs.</p><p>Next, the deceaseds secret, gay, dwarf lover (Dinklage, the best thing in the movie) tries to blackmail the deceaseds dutiful, put-upon son (Macfadyen) with some very candid photographs. Instead of paying, the put-upon son and his neer-do-well celebrity brother (Graves) opt to tie up the tiny extortionist and sedate him with some Valium they found.</p><p>The strained zaniness mounts and mounts, but no matter how severely decorum is obliterated, it instantly grows back, only to be shattered anew. Every joke is redundantly telegraphed, with a single unpleasant exception involving a hypochondriac (Nyman) whos obliged to help an old man use the toilet and comes away with excrement on his hands and face.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>A few scant pleasures can be had with <i>Repo! The Genetic Opera,</i> a tuneless slab of musical schlock. First comes the sight of Paris Hilton playing the plastic-surgery-obsessed daughter of a future magnate. While singing onstage, her entire face slips off like an especially silky negligee. Yuckbut a fascinating image. Second comes the embarrassing but riveting spectacle of <i>Goodfellas </i>Paul Sorvino crooning as the pungently named Rotti Largo, president of a company that reharvests organs when recipients cant make their payments. Sorvino must think hes doing Puccini. Finally, the inimitable Joan Jett makes a wordless cameo as a guitarist chugging behind some awful caterwauling. Her smirk says it all.</p><p>Working from an underground 2002 stage play, director Darren Lynn Bousman is trying to make the leap from the <i>Saw</i> movies (he did three of them). But he shouldnt be so quick to forget those films crude but effective measures. Bousmans big idea this time is to float the camera around aimlessly. None of his performances come to life, especially sub-Idol talent Alexa Vega as our heroine. Even a singer as experienced as Sarah Brightman is swaddled in distracting makeup and noise. Theres no song in <i>Repo!</i>s heartplus, its disembodied and squashed on the floor. </p>]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[<p>The voiceover narration at the beginning of <i>The White Ribbon</i>
offers up the story as a collection of memories that the speaker hopes
will clarify things that happened in our country. Given that the film
is set in Germany just before World War I, and that the narrator is an
old man reflecting on his days as the new teacher in a rural German
village, its clear just what recent events he hopes to explain; the
rise of fascism hovers over the action of the film as a threatened
future and a possible key to understanding the story.</p><p>But does
nascent fascism explain the puzzling incidents that, for a year or so,
disrupt life in this small town? Or is fascism just another symptom?
Things get off to a suitably nasty start when a horse stumbles on a
trip wire someone has strung across the road. Both sinister and
inexplicable, this prank is just the beginning of a season of
motiveless malignity (to borrow Coleridges apt description of Iago). A
child is kidnapped and beaten. A building is burned down. A worker is
killed in a freak workplace accident. All is not well in this seemingly
tranquil, cohesive community.</p><p>Leaving aside that unsettling
voiceover hint about fascism, the film begins with the elements of a
simple mystery: Whos behind all this, and why is it happening? But
Haneke, the man who brought us such dark explorations of the human
heart as <i>The Piano Teacher</i>, <i>Funny Games</i> and <i>Cach</i>, does not traffic in Agatha Christie puzzles with tidy solutions. The answers are more elusive and more troubling.</p><p>One
of the films neatest tricks is the way it plays on the history of
horror. Early on, we are introduced to the blond children of the
village, who move with creepy placidity and uniformity. <i>Children of the Corn</i>,
anyone? But if the children, who we cant help but think are going to
grow up to be adults during the era of Hitler, seem sinister, so do the
adults, especially those in positions of authority. The local baron
treats the villagers like serfs; the doctor is a manipulative jerk who
mistreats the widow with whom he is having a secret sexual
relationship. The pastor ties his sons hands at night to prevent
masturbation. Haneke rejects any idyllic vision of old-fashioned
village life, offering instead the past as an oppressive, barbaric
nightmare ready to give birth to the horrors of fascism.</p><p>But
Haneke eschews easy horror shocks, creating a sense of dread precisely
through the reserve of his filmmaking. No crazy camera angles or
menacing music here; Hanekes approach is almost spartan, often
shooting interiors by candlelight and relying on long takes and minimal
use of close-ups to keep the story at a bit of a distance. </p><p>Adding
to the aestheticization of the story is Hanekes choice to make the
film in black and white. He shot in color, since black-and-white film
is virtually impossible to get, and then digitally converted the images
to black and white. As Haneke has noted in interviews, this was no
casual choice; he and his crew, used to color film, had to learn a
whole new cinematic vocabulary. It was worth the effort. </p><p>The
overall effect of Hanekes refusal to sensationalize is that we are
given a lot of room to think, and the things Haneke urges us to think
about are not very nice. Though <i>The White Ribbon</i> may not clarify the origins of fascism, it opens a door on the cruelties large and small of which we are all capable.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Its impossible to describe <i>My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done</i>
without making it sound like an ingenious prank. (Then again, maybe
thats what its supposed to be.) A Werner Herzog noir! Produced by
David Lynch! Starring Michael Shannon as a San Diego man who goes crazy
after a white-water rafting trip and, influenced by his role as Orestes
in a local theater production, kills his mother (Zabriskie) with a
sword! With Willem Dafoe playing the detective who investigates!
Featuring supporting turns by Chlo Sevigny and Udo Kierthe latter as
a theater director whose glasses are eaten by an ostrich!</p><p>If the
nonstop parade of weirdness suggests Herzog is pulling a fast one,
theres a case to be made that Shannons character is just another in a
long line of the directors real-life-inspired eccentrics. (Nicolas
Cages post-Katrina bad lieutenant is only the latest addition to a
gallery of Klaus Kinski figures.) But even if Herzogs intentions are
sincere, his filmmaking has never seemed more slapdash or clumsy, and
his commitment to capturing unmitigated peculiarity has led to
performances so stilted that some of the characters seem to have
wandered in from the storefront play theyre rehearsing. As Shannon
rolls a can of oatmeal at the cops, its difficult not to wonder if the
movie was made on a dare.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>In Bremen, Germany, a middle-aged Turkish prostitute called Yeter (Kse) says goodbye to Ali (Kurtiz), an elderly Turkish john, in their native tongue. The exchange is overheard by puritanical Muslim thugs, who warn Yeter to repent. The confrontation motivates Yeter to reconsider Alis offer to support her as his live-in courtesan. Initially, Ali seems like an affable old rogue, but booze brings out his dark side, and the mnage ends in fatal tragedy.</p><p>Hoping to atone for his fathers violence, Alis son Nejat (Davrak), an introverted academic, travels to Istanbul to search for Yeters daughter Ayten (Yesilay). Ayten, however, has fled to Bremen to seek her mother and escape arrest for belonging to a left-wing revolutionary sect. In Bremen, Ayten falls in love with Lotte (Ziolkowska), an open-hearted university student, who, under the sorrowful gaze of her mother (Schygulla, in a miraculous return), absorbs Aytens passionate but nebulous political commitments, thus setting the stage for further catastrophe.</p><p>Turkish-German director Akins previous feature, <i>Head-On</i>, struck us as a histrionic mess. Similar insofar as they both address themes of cultural hybridity, <i>Head-On</i> and <i>Edge</i> could otherwise scarcely be less alike: <i>Edge</i> is a mature, stately, emotionally authentic and beautifully acted drama superior to anything weve seen this year. And dont listen to anyone who compares it to <i>Babel</i>.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Adapting Cormac McCarthys grim post-apocalyptic novel <i>The Road</i>
for the screen is the sort of thing an unwise filmmaker would do on a
dare. The power of McCarthys writing comes from his control of
language, which moves with ease between the terse stripped-down clarity
of Hemingway and richer, more lyrical passages. On the screen, at least
in Hillcoats hands, the mix of despair and philosophical musing on
hope feels false and forced.</p><p>A man (Mortensen) and his son
(Smit-McPhee) are walking across the dying American landscape some
years after an unspecified event has killed most animals and plants.
Theyre headed south, toward the coast, in hopes that things might be
better there. The man still believes in the fire, that inner spark
that symbolizes both basic humanity and the will to survive. He tries
to teach this principle to his son, but the farther they go, the more
the mans moral compass is tested. If surviving means losing your
humanity, is it worth surviving at all?</p><p>Hillcoat wants to be
bleak and astringent, but somehow the profundity has been bleached out.
Images that should be haunting are paraded before us, one after
another, and you can almost feel the film straining to convey its
significance.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Shot without government permission in a remote part of China, <i>Ghost Town</i>
is about as handmade as filmmaking comes. Divided into three
sectionsVoices, Recollections and Innocencethis gently aestheticized
documentary doesnt so much mount an argument as seek to immerse
viewers in the rhythms of life in the village of Zhiziluo, economically
depressed and sorting out conflicting ideals in the post-Mao era.</p><p>The
first section, focusing on the villages Christian community, will
likely be the most novel even for those who have followed the career of
Jia Zhangkeanother filmmaker who has sought to document Chinese lives
left behind in the push toward modernization. The church serves as a
glue for the town, which was heavily Christianized after missionaries
arrived around 1930. Bogging down in oral histories, the films middle
hour rambles slightly, showing a recurring interest in the economic
constraints of marriage. But neither chapter is adequate preparation
for the hypnotic last section, which follows La Xiaolong, a 12-year-old
boy abandoned by his parents at a young age, who scrapes together a
bare-bones existence hunting for his own food and squatting in
abandoned buildings. The film finds unlikely poetry in his story, seemingly
one of utter hopelessness, and uses it to bring this epic portrait full
circle.</p>]]></review>

to wearing medical Crocs in this semisuccessful horror flick, which
casts the towering performer as Eliot Deacon, a soft-spoken mortician
with the ability to talk to the recently deceased. Its never entirely
confirmed if his very particular set of skills is genuine or the
elaborate cover of a serial killer; suffice it to say that when
schoolteacher Anna Taylor (a necrolicious Christina Ricci) crosses his slab,
theres a lot of impassioned hemming and hawing about whether shes
dead or alive.</p><p>Deacon cleverly talks around the facts of her case
with the kind of mock-philosophical misdirection (Only I can see you
as you really are.) befitting the Saw films Jigsaw. Yet this bogeyman
is different: Neeson clearly relishes the role, but he never plays to
the cheap seats by going whole-hog psychotic. The characters
motivations remain tantalizingly opaque from first frame to last.</p><p>Would
that writer-director Wojtowicz-Vosloo brought the same sense of
tightrope-traversing rigor (minus mortis) to the rest of the film.
Ricci is certainly game, baring body and soul in her scenes with
Neeson. But two subplotsone involving Annas bereaved boyfriend, Paul
(Justin Long), the other one of her death-obsessed studentsact as damaging
narrative deadweight. This is one case where theres more life in the
morgue than out.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Youd think that, having conquered the comic-book superhero movie
world, Iron Man could cruise through a sequel with jaunty confidence.
But for whatever reason, <i>Iron Man 2</i> seems overly anxious
about keeping our attention, moving with ADHD impatience. The movies
enjoyable enough but oddly exhausting, frantic to re-create the charms
of the first film. Downey seems particularly hyper, tossing off asides
so fast youll probably need to see the film twice just to catch all
his zingers. (But perhaps thats the point; Tony Stark knows how to
maximize profit, and so does Favreau.) Its a blessing that the movie
comes in at just more than two hours, but at this clip, the emotional
stuff and the rest stops between action sequences get short shrift.
(Stark has to deal with dying from palladium poisoning, daddy issues
and a drinking problem, all dashed through so fast you have to admire
his therapist.) This time around, Starks dickish self-regard and
playboy ways, so endearing in the first film, start to wear out their
welcome. When he mocks a congressional committee and declares Ive
privatized world peace, its hard not to think of the arrogance of
CEOs singing the praises of the free market.</p><p>But you dont care about those sorts of nuances, do you? Its <i>Iron Man 2</i>,
dude. You want to see shit blow up and Stark strut around like cock of
the walk between video-game battles. Youll get that, plus a lot of
comic-book inside jokes and lumbering setup work for the coming
Avengers franchise. Jacksons Nick Fury seems impatient to get on with
it and get a movie of his own, where he has more to do than deliver
cryptic hints about S.H.I.E.L.D. As Russian baddie Ivan Vanko, Rourke
hams it up, glowering and sneering and using an accent so thick it
sounds as if he has marbles in his mouth.</p><p>Favreau does a fair but
not great job with the action, often cluttering things so much that you
cant work out whos hitting whom. Its not a <i>Transformers 2</i>
level of incoherence, but we couldnt help thinking that the climactic
battle royal, and in fact the whole film, should have been more awesome
and less noisy.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>You know how conservatives always attack Michael Moore on his
methods, pretending that its not his political positions they hate?
Imagine someone doing a Michael Moorestyle doc, but attacking unions.
In taking on the horrendous state of education in New Jersey (and, by
implication, the entire United States), Bowdon deploys an impressive
mix of statistics and news headlines, jokey but effective stunts
(counting the luxury cars in the parking lot of a school-district
administration building) and interviews with mealy-mouthed
representatives of the opposition, which in this case is the New
Jersey Education Association.</p><p>The doc begins with one of those
Im not here to attack unions disclaimers that you know means the
filmmaker is going to kick the living shit out of unions. Bowdon
chronicles the insanely high spending on education in New Jerseys
public schools (more than $400,000 per classroom in some districts) and
the even more insanely lame results (illiterate kids graduating high
school). Guess why Johnny cant read. Unions. Charter schools then ride
in on a white horse (almost literallythe graphics of happy
charter-school kids and sad public-school kids are pretty unsubtle) to
save us all.</p><p>Bowdons tactics generate the desired outrage, even
if you wish there were more time to examine some of his basic premises.
Education is in serious trouble, and teachers unions arent exactly
promoting the highest ideals. Goddamn unions! Michael Moore must be
groaning at what he has wrought.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The doors of perception are further cleansed in director Tom DiCillos tribute to
the Doors, fronted by the late Jim Morrison. Yet nothing appears
particularly infinite: DiCillo adeptly skewered Indiewood in the
moviemaking satire <i>Living in Oblivion</i> (1995), but his
documentary skills are rudimentary and crude, shaped mostly by his
shallow fandom for the group. The worst dialogue of the year so far
comes from Johnny Depps smarmy narration track: But you cant burn
out, he says of Morrison, if you were never on fire. Stop the
presses, Bill Blake!</p><p>Of course, such pseudo-profundity suits the
Doors. Taken out of context, those lines about lizard kings and monks
buying lunch seem even more like masturbatory grabs at enlightenment;
the bands genius came from the ways Morrison, Ray Manzarek, Robby
Krieger and John Densmore enveloped the words within their own
inimitable sound. They reflected the zeitgeist even as they reached
beyond it. </p><p>The doc is good for illuminating some of the groups
methods (the lack of a bass player was a liberating bit of
happenstance), as well as for showcasing a wide swath of previously
unseen footage from concerts and recording sessions. Morrison
inevitably takes center stage, since his drug-addled personahalf
shaman, half sex addictis the easiest to view with uncritical awe.
Like so many Doors chroniclers, DiCillo cant help but fall under the
singers spell; its understandable, but frustrating.</p>]]></review>

Give him a speech in which he takes a scalpel to the heart of our
sentimentality and Clooney is at his finest. He gets just such a speech
in <i>Up in the Air</i>. When hes not jetting from company to
company firing people as a consultant, Ryan Bingham has a nice little
sideline in motivational speaking. His standard spiel is about
unpacking our backpacks; he imagines all the things that weigh us
down, like possessions, friends, family, emotional connections. Ryan,
of course, has eschewed all that in favor of the life of a Zen road
warrior chalking up frequent-flier miles. Its terrific fun watching
him rupture the navet of Natalie (Kendrick), a young up-and-comer at
work whose efficiency-minded proposals threaten his happy existence in
the skies. </p><p>You probably sense a but coming up, and indeed <i>Up in the Air</i>
cant avoid the inevitable punishment that awaits anyone in American
culture who does not embrace family and love and marriage and all that
crap. The pleasant surprise is that the screenplay (by Reitman and
Sheldon Turners screenplay from a novel by Walter Kirn) makes its
concessions to sentiment so halfheartedly. One of the joys of <i>Up in the Air</i>
is the no-strings relationship between Ryan and another frequent flier
(Farmiga) who seems equally detachedits like watching beautiful
sharks mate. Reitmans eye for satire is as sharp as it was in <i>Thank You for Smoking</i>, and our only regret is that the movie makes any concessions at all to the conventions of Hollywood. Bring on the sharks.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Since the 1960s, twin brothers George and Mike Kuchar have been
incredibly prolific filmmakers (I dont think anybody even knows how
many works George has made, muses Anthology Films Andrew Lampert).
Their works, and especially those of the more prolific George, form the
ultra-low-budget bridge between the glossy melodramas of Douglas Sirk
and the trash aesthetic of John Waters. A typical Kuchar film might mix
a love story, a horror plot and some family melodrama. In this
enjoyable doc, director Jennifer M. Kroot shows enough clips that even a newbie can get a
sense of the Kuchar aesthetic, but she places the clips in a
traditional doc framework (interviews with friends and fans, a clear
chronology of their lives and clips are doled out in equal measure).</p><p>Kroot
also gives us a sense of ultra-gregarious George and more introverted
Mike. Raised strict Catholics in the Bronx, the Kuchars both bring a
strange mix of fascination and guilt to the subject of sex, which comes
up in all their films in one way or another. But what doesnt come up
in a Kuchar film? For them, its not enough to include the kitchen
sink; they have to throw in the toilet too, if only to violate
Hollywoods decorum. While capturing the weird mix of awe, amusement
and boredom that any Kuchar film can evoke, Kroot gives these
godfathers of the underground film movement the respect they deserve.</p>]]></review>

A firecracker blunder catapults Po smack into a celebrated selection process, where he becomes the Chosen One. An accident, you say? There are no accidents, calmly insists ancient turtle Oogway (Kim), who apparently invented kung fu and doles out wisdom like fortune cookies.</p><p>The animation veers from dazzling (particularly in an opening sequence deeply indebted to Genndy Tartakovskys wildly superior cartoon saga, <i>Samurai Jack</i>) to merely mechanical, showing only sporadic visual flair but, like much of the movie, otherwise content to revel in its conventional invention.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Who wants to see an avant-garde feminist masterpiece, other than feminists and the avant-garde? You should. Dont be spooked by the daunting length, the formalist mise-en-scne, or the fact that great chunks of screen time are devoted to potato peeling and dish washing. <i>Jeanne Dielman</i> is immersion cinema, a brilliant example of maximal minimalism that fuses viewer with subject so profoundly, the marathon experience transcends simple spectatorship.</p><p>Two and a half days pass in the life of a Belgian widow (Seyrig), who methodically fixes meals, cleans the house, tends to her teenage son (Decorte), goes on errandsoh, and whores herself in the afternoons. Sure, the films cinematic strategies, gender agenda and postwar condemnation of petite bourgeoisie forever tether it to the Me Decade. But <i>Jeanne Dielman</i> is far more than a political screed; its statements about the human condition, about our fears and frailties and the veneer of convention over a cauldron of regret and self-denial, are as universal and timeless as Greek tragedy.</p><p><i>Jeanne Dielman</i> plays like a slow-motion thriller. After all the stylized repetition of chores, a sudsy plate or a dropped knife is enough to chill the blood. Life is maintenance, and that maintenance is a form of both preservation and asphyxiation. Its the menial tasks and ritual errands that shield the soul from existential crisis, but they can also form the wall that prevents emotional engagement. And Jeanne Dielmans quiet desperation will speak volumes to every new generationas long as theyre willing to watch. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In this stunningly charmless romcom, pet-store owner Zoe (Jennifer Lopez) has
a crippled Boston terrier called Nuts who gets around with the aid of a
little cart. The poor little fellow, as you might imagine, is often
deployed for aw reaction shots. He also begs for food, with a look
that mixes hope and despair in equal measure. Youll recognize that
look, since you can also see it on the faces of Lopez and her supposed
romantic interest Alex OLoughlin. Bad actors! No biscuit!<p>Its not
entirely their fault. The only novel twist in the script is that Zoe,
tired of waiting to meet the right man, has decided to have a baby on
her own. This leads to such distinctive delights as watching Lopez sit
on the toilet with a home pregnancy kit, trying to relax and pee while
little Nuts looks on quizzically (Aw). Otherwise, the whole thing is
like a Franken-romcom, made from parts dug up at midnight. On the very
day she is artificially inseminated, Zoe meets Stan, a hunky,
good-natured cheese maker who inexplicably keeps an apartment in the
city though he has a sprawling farm upstate. He also has a
distressingly well-developed torso, and OLoughlins often pained
facial expression may be because hes in a constant state of flex. The
possibility that he might rupture something from all the flexing
provides the only real tension in the movie, since hes so perfectly
nice and caring that theres never any question about whether they
should be together. </p><p>Weirdly, a movie about a single woman who
decides to have a baby makes other single mothers the butts of endless
jokes about their neediness, their hippie-dippy water-birthing, their
inappropriate breast-feeding of a three-year-old, etc. The elderly get
equal mockery, so theres that.</p>]]></review>

do: They fire large, exotic, presumably illegal weapons off the tops of
city buildings. They flirt with sinewy Zoe Saldana, who, between her
updated Uhura in <i>Star Trek</i> and Navi princess in <i>Avatar</i>, has hit the nerd sweet spot. And, most enviably, they exist in a world where they dont have to watch <i>The Losers</i>and weep for the vanilla trashiness that dominates our mainstream.</p><p>There has to be a term coined for these bloodless, gung-ho superteam movies, crap like <i>Fantastic Four</i> and <i>G.I. Joe</i>, films that seem inspired by <i>South Park</i>s puppeteered <i>Team America: World Police</i> but without the irony. Plastic explosives, maybe? Blithely destructive of foreign lands and as smooth as a Ken dolls crotch, <i>The Losers</i>
is the ultimate example, scraped from the bottom of the comic-book
barrel, where writer Andy Diggles figurine-like characters first had
their exploits in an exciting War on Terror. Theres commando leader
Clay (<i>Watchmen</i>s rakish Jeffrey Dean Morgan), demolitions expert Roque
(Idris Elba, paying bills), motormouthed jokester Jensen (Chris Evans)and here I
really must stop before I begin to sound like a Mattel salesman.</p><p>You
can choose to follow the plot after an initial Bolivian black-op goes
bad and the squad is abandoned by the CIA (bummer), but such exercises
are pointless. Load up on popcorn and wait for the coma to hit. Youve
got devilish Patric providing occasional distraction as a snarky,
underutilized villain named Max. Every once in a while, a generic
computerized effect goes off, making you wonder about the
air-conditioned lives of moviemakers. This summer, were also getting a
big-screen <i>The A-Team</i>; heres the D-Team.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Although based on the real-life tale of nine underage underdogs from
Monterrey, Mexico, who swept the 1957 Little League World Series, this
Cinderella sports story rings false from first pitch to last. Boys
cant just be boys herethey need to be pint-size saints, keeping the
faith and crusading against racism. With God fully on our sidethe
Christian sermonizing leans heavily on vague, theologically dubious
suggestions of divine baseball providencetheres not even a
swing-and-a-miss threat to the preordained outcome.</p><p>Recently
fired MLB janitor Cesar (Collins) retreats South of the Border to
booze, scowl and don a wifebeater, until a kid named Angel (!)
strong-arms him into coaching the towns fledgling ball team. Along
with the local priest (Marin), Cesar shepherds them to the promised
landsotherwise known as Texas and Kentuckyand then to the
championship, where the film belabors its namesake. Dear, apparent king
of baseball devotionals (<i>Angels in the Outfield</i>, <i>The Sandlot 3</i>),
betrays no understanding or respect for how the game is actually
played: He harps on home-run money shots in which balls limply fly as
if they were being controlled by string, remote control or the ghost of
Ed Wood. <i>The Perfect Game</i> courts its target demos like a
leg-humping hound, but sports fans, believers, Latinos and even
wanna-be Willie Mayses can find fellowship elsewhere.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of the monumental achievements in narrative filmmaking, Sergio Leones grandiose 1966 western epic is nothing less than a masterclass in movie storytelling, a dynamic testament to the sheer, invigorating uniqueness of cinema.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are their usual taciturn selves as rival gunslingers pursuing a cache of lost gold. So its left to Eli Wallachs Tuco to steal the show, the archetypal pitiable, self-deluded villain, the rotten heart of Leones colossal canvas.<br />Its hard to name another film with so many iconic, indelible sequences: Tuco following a trail of half-smoked cigars; the unmanned stagecoach thundering through the desert; the operatic Mexican standoff in the graveyard, as Ennio Morricones peerless score mounts over five nailbiting, wordless minutes. But what impresses most is the intimacy of Leones vision, sketching a vast array of ruthless characters with broad but subtle visual strokes, never losing sight of the humanity amidst the carnage.]]></review>

only in a very limited form. Thus, this doc explains some of the Hubble
telescopes incredible images of the stars in laymans terms, blurring
over the intricacies of how these images were created and just what the
hell a star nursery really is. Neil deGrasse Tyson would never allow
this level of vagueness on <i>NOVA scienceNOW</i>. But the real
action here is the footage of the 2008 space-shuttle mission to repair
and upgrade the Hubble. Watching an astronaut deal with tiny, balky
screws in zero-G is oddly riveting, and the orbiting Hubble is a
perfect object for 3-D, giving the vertiginous sensation of depth where
depth means looking on the Earth 300 miles below.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Like <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i>, <i>A Nightmare on Elm Street</i>
lends itself to so many variations and spin-offs because its true
villain isnt a monster, but the most basic of human needs: sleep. The
degree to which the remake exhausts you probably depends on your
reverence for the original. Stylistically situated midway between the
bourgeois-indicting crudeness of <i>The Last House on the Left</i> (1972) and the well-oiled thrills of <i>Scream</i>
(1996), Wes Cravens 1984 film became famous for its bogeyman effects,
its portrait of teen angst andfor a then-ascendant New Line Cinemaits
unexpected mainstream success. But it lacks the elegance of
near-contemporaries like <i>Halloween</i> or <i>Alien</i>; today the most famous sequences seem edited to privilege the design work over shocks.</p><p>So its not as though the new <i>Nightmare</i>
is slaughtering a sacred cow. As helmed by music-video and commercial
vet Bayer, this polished, Michael Bayproduced reboot could scarcely be
more respectful. Keeping the torture porn to a minimum, it adds a
garish palette, cell phones, Google searches, some ingenious variations
on the formula (adrenaline shots; micro-naps, or waking dreams)
andas seems to be de rigueur for recent horror remakesironic use of a
golden oldie. (Here its a pharmacy sequence set to the Everly
Brothers All I Have to Do Is Dream.) Mara and Gallner make an
attractive couple on the lamyes, those are Chicago locations, at least
in partand Haley, as Freddy Krueger, hams it up to an almost alarming
degree. Bayer also plays on expectations from the earlier film, notably
with a bathtub scene fakeout. But the movie stops short of full-fledged
reinvention: Paradoxically, its a stylish gloss on the original that
never quite feels like its own film. It turns out this Freddy is a
vampire.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Proving that a comedys performers are sometimes more important than
its jokes, this remake of Frank Ozs dreary 2007 British farce of the
same name livens up the proceedings by subbing in a comic
African-American all-star cast. As before, the setting is a deceased
family patriarchs services, which are spearheaded by the dutiful
oldest son (Rock) and his hotshot-author younger brother (Lawrence);
all manner of romantic, sibling-rivalry and cross-generational
wackiness ensues, mostly of the strained <i>Threes Company</i> variety.</p><p>Nude,
hallucinogen-fueled jaunts on rooftops, revelations about same-sex
relationshipswith a little person, no lessand individuals covered in
feces are all executed with verve by the typically misanthropic LaBute.
Its his formidable cast (which also includes Luke Wilson, Peter
Dinklage, James Marsden and Danny Glover) that really keeps things
moving, though its ability to generate postmortem yuks by brute comedic
force never quite compensates for the middling slapstick nature of the
high jinks and an overreliance on easy poop and gay-panic gags. Still,
this <i>Death</i> laps the original, laugh-wise, and is LaButes
second-funniest film to date, trailing only his unintentionally
amusing, WTF cover version of <i>The Wicker Man</i>.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>This doc profiles 90-year-old dance artist (and Winnetka native)
Anna Halprin after a wave of renewed interest in her work that began in
Europe about five years ago. While this isnt exactly a hagiography,
numerous cuts point to friction in her creative partnershipsmost
notably with John Graham and A. A. Leathwithout following up. The end
result is a standard-issue dance film that suggests drama only to demur
on grounds of maintaining the sanctity of its subject. (Halprins
daughter Daria remembers longing to be like the so-called normal kids
in 1960 while we see Graham prancing around with the then-ten-year-old
high over his head. She recalls discomfort with the riskiness of the
performance but, tellingly, her mother doesnt comment, and Anna and
Daria never appear in the same frame.)</p><p>Director Ruedi Gerber offsets his
timidity with a treasure trove of archival material. Merce Cunningham
is captured on film during a West Coast homecoming, and a montage of
clips from <i>Ceremony of UsRight On!</i> (1968) offers a
fascinating close-up on experimental community healing in the wake of
the Watts riots. Halprins conflicted relationship with the dance world
is increasingly pushed to the foreground, as it apparently has been in
life; the earthbound story of Bay Area modern dance that ran
perpendicular to New York formalism is the true subject here, and
Halprin is, more than anyone else, its author.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>A diamond in the rough is elevated from poverty, taken under the
wing of a taskmaster, schooled in rarefied classical technique, and
escapes fate to become prodigal, inspiring greatness in friends and
family back home. Aided significantly by its subjects sincerity and
talent and a supporting cast of ballet luminaries, director Anne Basss portrait of
Cambodian-born dancer Sokvannara Sar mostly cheats this minefield of
clichs despite painting it by numbers.</p><p>The docs core is Sars
relationship with teacher Olga Kostritzky, who, after Sar is initially
denied entrance to the School of American Ballet, brings him up to
speed in a matter of months. (As a former student of Kostritzkys, I
can attest that this feat, while dubious, is indeed possible.) Sar
finds work with Seattles Pacific Northwest Ballet, reaches the
semifinal round at the ballet Olympics in Varna, Bulgaria, and shares
a stage in Vail with Philip Glass; as PNB artistic director Peter Boal
puts it, his story had a one in a thousand chance of working out, and
did.</p><p>Bass herself discovered Sar at a Khmer folk-dance
performance during a trip to Siem Reap, brought him to the U.S.,
presumably underwrote his private lessons, and produced this
documentary, but doesnt much get into why; her film moves the most
when Sar wonders aloud about the path she placed him on.</p>]]></review>

pretty colors and florid melodrama of his early work, the
cine-fetishism and Hitchcockian twists of plotting of his later work.
But <i>Broken Embraces</i> doesnt feel like a Greatest Hits album; its more like a cover-band version of an Almodvar film.</p><p>A
blind amnesiac screenwriter, who now goes only by his old nom de plume
Harry Caine (Homar), gets drawn into recalling his past by the death of
a financier and the probing questions of his agents son (Novas).
Harry, we learn, was once the film director Mateo Blanco. He was in
love with Lena (Cruz), but she was tangled up with Mateos wealthy but
sinister backer (Gmez). Meanwhile, in the present day, Harry/Mateo has
to deal with a mysterious filmmaker who wants something from him.</p><p>The
further we descend into this maze, the more references to other films
pop up. Here comes a bit of Hitchcock (the untrustable woman), and
theres some Douglas Sirk (the general air of melodrama). Hey, is that
a Michael Powell reference in the way Mateo uses his camera like a
weapon? And the movie Mateo was making looks like a parody of
Almodvars own <i>Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown</i>. By the end, we couldnt quite untangle the plot twists and all the cinematic references, but, more troubling, we didnt care.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Wit does not become this DreamWorks-produced 3-D animated feature, which commences with California girl Susan Murphy (Witherspoon) taking a gunk-filled meteorite to the head on her wedding day. Until this point, her problems are pure West Coasta selfish weatherman boyfriend (Rudd) who prizes career over all and a perpetual yearning to visit Paris. But then the space slime Susan absorbs turns her into a 50-foot-tall superwoman named, wait for it, Ginormica. Now imprisoned at a secret military base, she seems doomed to while away the years in solitary confinement with various other monsters, like the half-ape/half-fish Missing Link (Arnett) and the mad scientist insect Dr. Cockroach Ph.D. (Laurie). That is until an off-worlder named Gallaxhar (Wilson) comes to Earth with nefarious plans for domination and a clone army at the ready.</p><p><i>Monsters vs. Aliens</i> reaches the (relative) heights of hilarity only twice. First instance: When the films dim-witted POTUSan amalgam of all the worst aspects of Reagan and Clinton, voiced, natch, by Colbertcommunicates with an alien cyborg by tinkling Harold Faltermeyers Axel F on the synthetic ivories. Second instance: When the Rogen-essayed living globule B.O.B. one-sidedly romances and breaks up with a neon green Jell-O mold. There are also a few lovingly detailed San Francisco landmarks such as the Golden Gate Bridge, which meets a memorably destructive end. But <i>MvA</i> is mostly a brainless parade of half-baked gags, punctuated by the occasional fourth-wall-breaking effect. Only those who desire a paddleball to the kisser or a face full of Mothra snot need apply. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A  grouchy old man walks out of a retirement home and heads back to
his farm, which he finds his son has rented out to white trash. The
outraged codger settles into a sharecroppers shack on the property and
begins a war of wills. In the wrong hands, this story could be either
sentimental goo or heavy-handed Southern Gothic. <i>That Evening Sun</i>
is saved from the former fate by the resolutely unsentimental
performance of Hal Holbrook as Abner Meecham, an octogenarian whose blunt
talk and permanent scowl emphatically do not hide a heart of gold.
Holbrook, who can do warm folksy with his eyes closed when he wants to,
once again shows that he can do something with sharper edges. This
isnt quite as good as his Oscar-nominated turn in <i>Into the Wild</i>, but, hey, that was an amazing performance.<p>If
this drama errs slightly on the side of Southern Gothic, thats not
Holbrooks fault. The script gives us Lonzo Choat (Ray McKinnon), whose
name sounds like something out of Faulkner, and whose lazy,
beer-drinking, wife-beating ways suggest Bob Ewell from <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>.
McKinnon does what he can to anchor this character, but the story
pushes things to extremes when subtlety would work better. Still, its
a pleasure to watch the cast, all very good, make the best of the
material.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Ilisa Barbash and Lucien Castaing-Taylors documentary (which played at the most recent New York Film Festival) never tops its precredits sequence: Languorous images of Montanas Absaroka-Beartooth Mountains give way to an extended view of a sheep contentedly eating grass. The animal chews and chews for what seems like several minutes, then suddenly stops and looks smack-dab into the camera for an uncomfortably long time. Its tempting to imagine the creature is endowed with human emotions, but the truth is that theres nothing in its dead-eyed gaze beyond involuntary instinct. </p><p>Thats the perfect note on which to begin <i>Sweetgrass,</i> which turns out to be a requiem for a lost way of life. Beginning in 2001, Barbash and Castaing-Taylor filmed a family of sheepherderswhose business is now defuncttaking the animals into the mountains for summer pasture. As subcultural anthropology, its unassailable. Yet the often ugly-looking DV aesthetic dilutes the cumulative effect. For every gorgeously low-res image (a blobby, white sea of sheep racing heedlessly toward their pen), theres a correspondingly ineffectual visual or vista that one wishes had been captured with higher-end equipment and a keener cinematic eye.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Movements need anthems, and the fight for civil rights in the 50s and 60s had some amazing ones: We Shall Overcome, Eyes on the Prize, Aint Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around. These songs gave everyday men and women the power to stand up and the fortitude to not stand down. You can credit Bill Guttentag and Dan Sturmans documentary for reminding us about just what these freedom fighters had to endure: public humiliations, police brutality and constant threats of physical violence. Even if youve seen this footage of the sit-ins at Southern diners, the Selma-to-Montgomery marches and Martin Luther King Jr.s funeral before, you cant help but be moved to your core. For anyone who is either ignorant of or has simply forgotten the extent to which broken bones and unbowed heads paved the way for the Obama Age, its a much-needed history lesson.</p><p>But only the revolution itself gets the necessary rigorous attention; the actual soundtrack, ostensibly the focus, is treated like a footnote. Songs are mentioned and praised by talking heads, lyrics are presented as graphic text, then theyre summarily dismissed; any deeper notions about the who, where and why behind these gospel and folk tunes are largely left on the cutting-room floor. And far be it from us to pass up seeing the Roots or John Legend perform, but the idea that watching todays performers interpret inspiring standards can camouflage lazy musicology is, frankly, misguided at best. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I feel that hes a self-hating Jew, says a childhood friend of Norman Finkelstein, the controversial author of 2000s <i>The Holocaust Industry </i>and a fierce critic of what he considers grief exploitation. Hes certainly a <i>Jew</i>-hating Jew. <br /></p><p>Other voices add to the complexity: an intellectual endorsement from former mentor Noam Chomsky (in a weird Kennedyesque photo, we see the two of them boating); a harsh slam from Harvards Alan Dershowitz, a sustained target of Finkelsteins critiques. Then theres the subject himself, the child of death-camp survivors. Unrepentant at the podium, he brings even mild-mannered Canadians to tears with his anti-Zionist screeds. Hes a bit of a showboat.<br /></p><p>With impressive restraint, the fascinatingly thorny<i> American Radical </i>is less interested in the validity of Finkelsteins ideasseriously mounted, if inflammatoryand more in the topsy-turvy life of todays professional academic. Amazingly, that choice doesnt result in a boring movie: We see student protests at Chicagos DePaul University in 2007 after Finkelstein is denied tenure (hes bounced among five different schools) and sit with the man in the back of a car as he wearily suggests that if his polemics were just about money, hed be smarter to change fields. His own worst enemy, Finkelstein has both trouble and tragic writ large on his brow.<br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>There seems to be an unwritten rule that family films are
mind-numbingly predictable; they traffic in plots and characters so
elemental it would make Joseph Campbell blush. So it goes with <i>A Shine of Rainbows</i>.
Awkward, stuttering lad Toms (John Bell) is whisked away from a grim
orphanage by smiling, warm-hearted Maire (Connie Nielsen), who takes him to
her rural home on a remote island.</p><p>Alas for Toms, Maires
husband, Alec (Aidan Quinn), isnt as keen on the adoption. As the film makes
very clear with repeated shots of the unsigned adoption papers, Toms
has to win over Alec or its back to the orphanage.</p><p>Were not
giving away much by saying Alec isnt as gruff as he first appears. Nor
is it hard to guess what will happen when Toms finds an orphaned seal
on the shore.</p><p>Bell should steer clear of roles that involve
stuttering, but once he gets to the crying scenes you can see why he
was cast. And well just warn you that there is plenty of crying. Director Vic Sarin
offers up magical whimsy and weepy moments in equal measure, with Irish
piping for every occasion laid out liberally on the soundtrack. This is
about as subtle as a St. Patricks Day parade, but well grant that as
kids films go, its pretty good.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Theres a secret all right, and its how this sprawling but
pedestrian drama nabbed this years Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.
(Ive seen four out of five nominees, and Michael Hanekes <i>The White Ribbon</i>
is the best in a walk.) Still, this is a case when the inflation of an
award hurts more than it helps, and if you can get past the movies
attempts to pastiche <i>Citizen Kane</i> with <i>Law &amp; Order</i>
(director Juan Jos Campanella has made many episodes of the latter), the novelistic
pretensions conceal an engaging crime story about a prosecutor (Ricardo Darn)
reexamining a for-all-intents-and-purposes unresolved rape-murder case
he investigated decades earlier.</p><p>Seesawing between the 70s and
the 90s (and engaging with the fallout from Argentinas Dirty Wara
campaign against left-wing militants by the military governmentin an
oblique sense), the flashback structure creates more whiplash than
tension; theres the sense that the movie either needed a tighter focus
or should have been a miniseries. Similarly, the protagonists 20-year
flirtation with a coworker (Soledad Villamil) often seems like something from
another filmas does the distractingly elaborate, apparent long-take
chase sequence that constitutes <i>Secret</i>s major set piece. But
if the movie doesnt exactly shoulder the burden of history, it passes
muster as a mystery freighted with more than its share of coincidence
and twists.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>From the opening shotfour warriors in a high mountain meadow facing
four directions, waiting for something (we learn in the next shot that
they are hunting a wild boar)<i>Ran</i> announces itself as a
meditation on mans place in an indifferent or possibly malevolent
universe. It also announces in sometimes overbearing tones its status
as a masterpiece. Stripped of sentimentality and practically devoid of
close-ups, <i>Ran</i> seems to side with the universe against
humanity, gazing with chilly aesthetic and literal distance as Lord
Hidetora (Nakadai) turns his kingdom over to his children, only to find
hes misjudged them.</p><p>Kurosawa works on an epic scale, with
thousands of soldiers and hundreds of horses to give the story a proper
sense of scale and catastrophe (Kurosawa said that one subject of this
feudal drama is the threat of nuclear war and the consequent
devastation). But whats the point of doing Shakespeare without
Shakespeares language? </p><p>The answer comes in Kurosawas visual
sense. Kurosawas work is often referred to as painterly (he trained as
a painter), but it might be more accurate to say that Kurosawa had a
great eye for cinematic composition, since his finest images often
involve the careful orchestration of movement. Just watch the famous
sequence in which Hidetora descends a staircase from a burning castle
and walks through a field of soldiers like a mad Moses parting the Red
Sea. </p><p>Kurosawas message is as grim as Shakespeares in <i>King Lear</i>;
justice has been replaced by merciless cycles of revenge, and happy
endings are a delusion, since the only true ending is death. Kurosawa
ends the film with another justly famous image: the blind man on the
edge of a cliff. Its unsubtle as imagery goes, but haunting
nonetheless.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Inspired by the true story of a young Frenchwoman who pretended to be
the victim of an anti-Semitic attack, Andr Tchins almost perversely
intransigent new film doesnt so much illuminate its (fictionalized)
protagonists motives as treat her as a sympathetic enigma: Perhaps
shes seeking attention, perhaps shes lashing out in the only way she
understands. Generically, the movie is a mix, and those not familiar
with the case might think for long stretches that this is a film about
young love, the difficulty of finding a job, drug trafficking or simply
the state of modern Judaism in France. <p>milie Dequenne, who almost looks as if shes aged backward since her breakthrough in <i>Rosetta</i>
(1999), plays Jeanne, who skates through life (literally, on
Rollerblades) as a mostly passive observer. The combination of a
shooting, her boyfriends arrest and a Holocaust special on TV stirs
her to cut herself and draw swastikas on her stomach, and then pretend
to have been beaten by thugs. Tchin mixes styles along with subjects,
making striking use of superimposition and turning an instant-message
flirtation into a beguiling dance of superimposed text. A strange,
unclassifiable film, <i>The Girl on the Train</i> stays compelling without being especially lucid.</p>]]></review>

Sure enough, one Midwestern subject shrugs, unable to remember much of that boyhood day on the grass in front of the huge American flag. Townspeople of Butte, Montana, offer banal notes on their shifting economic fortunes. One of Franks assistants recalls him admitting to a fear of getting my ass kicked by a black man. Worst is Scliers blurry camerawork, an approximation of rawness that only makes you yearn for Franks definitive stillness. An accompanying Harlem-shot short, In the Street (1948), doesnt compensate.</p>]]></review>

tasked by his evil Asian boss (Jeong) with cutting down an Oregonian

whose back is invariably turned whenever a CGI-tweaked raccoon or
wombat inflicts retaliatory crotch-damage on her husband. Most of this
is exactly as dispirited and perfunctory as youd expect from the
billboards. Once or twice the misery is punctuated by actual humor
(e.g. Husss Dadaist turn as a demented security chief), but these
unexpected nuggets only serve to highlight the lazy, cynical

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Acclaimed as one of the best Irish playwrights of his generation,
Conor McPherson has earned his rep as a first-rate dynamo of the theater: He
blesses his damaged characters with the gifts of gab and profundity,
and in works like <i>The Seafarer</i>, the writer has brilliantly
combined Celtic variations on psychological realism with supernatural
elements. Which makes you wonder if theres another Conor McPherson
lurking out there, a filmmaker who coincidentally shares the name and
obsessions of the Tony-nominated artist. How else to explain this
surprisingly stillborn, tone-deaf drama thats attributed to such a
monumental talent? That, or some McPhersonesque apparition is playing a
cruel trick.</p><p>Having recently lost his wife, Michael (Ciaran Hinds) works
through his grief while shepherding a boorish best-selling writer
(Aidan Quinn) around a local arts festival. The two compete for the attention
of a female novelist (Iben Hjejle)the middle-aged mourner passively, the
asshole author aggressivelywith the occasional vengeful specter
spooking Michael in his sleep. (The only thing scarier than bloodied
spirits aregasp!egomaniacal literary superstars.) Any subtlety that
Hinds, an actor who already looks perpetually haunted, brings to his
role is counteracted by Quinns gorging on scenery. But whats worse is
that, unlike McPhersons stage work, <i>The Eclipse</i> never finds
a common ground between the fantastic and the heartfelt. Such
unintegrated flip-flopping between a muted character study and a horror
flick relying on cheap scare tactics leaves you feeling mildly
schizophrenic; its a movie whose meanings and points are as obscured
as its title suggests.</p>]]></review>

coo awww, a baby when a stroller passes by with a cute infant in tow?
If so, run, dont walk, to this documentary. If not, you might be bored
stiff. That being said, this film, which follows four infantsin
Mongolia, San Francisco, Namibia and Tokyofrom first breath to first
steps, is so darn adorable it has a lulling effect that will mellow
even the most vehement baby haters. </p><p>The movie is the brainchild
of Alain Chabat, but its French director Thomas Balmes who soars,
manipulating his footage in such a way that both the universal and the
culturally specific elements of these babies upbringings are keenly
felt. Though youll feel a range of emotionshock when the camera zooms
in on a live birth scene, laughter when one infant tries to escape a
hippie, eco-baby class, pounding on the doors to get outsadness is not
in this documentarys vocabulary. All the babies plod along to the
soundtrack of Sufjan Stevenss The Perpetual Self, all giggles,
adorableness and discovery. Its infectious; youll walk out of the
theater feeling happy to be human, wishing you could go out and buy a
baby, or at least borrow one for a little while. Then youll look at
your watch and not believe you spent the past 79 minutes watching
babies crawl aroundand didnt mind at all.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Hey, aspiring indie filmmakers, hows this for an original idea? Why
not explore the dissatisfaction of the middle-aged American male? You
could focus entirely on a carpenter struggling with parenthood and
frustrated with his failing marriage. But rather than dramatize his
dilemma<i>so bourgeois!</i>just have him wax philosophic in
incredibly spot-on terms in voiceover while you track your camera
through his thoroughly ordinary-looking home. Over the climactic
dialoguesince no one in this movie will talk about much except how
miserable they are, the word <i>conversation</i> doesnt quite
applyspice things up by zooming out a window. During a lot of the
narration you can just show exteriors of Oakland. (Youre a
cinematographer-turned-director, and its a good way to show off how
serious you are.) Pretty, but not too pretty. <i>Just like life.</i> But avant-garde.</p><p>To make sure your audience doesnt doze, from time to time show your protagonist talking with other people (<i>characters</i>
is too strong a word), and add the occasional burst of minimalist
scoring. Like in that Peter Greenaway film! To emphasize the boredom
theme, include a couple of shots of your protagonist <i>actually staring into the void</i>.
Itll be a monument to the everydayness of the everyday. Radical, man!
Everything about it will be resolutely familiar and amateurish,
butheres the thingyoull make it profound by calling it <i>Everything Strange and New</i>. The debates will never end.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>If <i>Hoop Dreams</i> is the ultimate example of how looking closely at a varsity sport can open a window on American society, <i>Takedowns and Falls</i>
demonstrates what happens when a documentary doesnt get far from the
arena. Thats not to say this panoramic portrait of the wrestling team
at Central Dauphin High School in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, lacks drama
or even heartbreakCoach Jeff Sweigard was diagnosed with lymphoma in
the fall of 2005, when the film begins, and many of the teen wrestlers
view their performances in the season as reflections of whether theyve
triumphed over personal struggles. But the movie is rambling and
unstructured; its endless slo-mo practice sequences feel like padding,
and a lot of extraneous footage has been yoked together with generic
keyboard and guitar riffs.</p><p>Directors Todd Hickey and Kirk Ledger are reportedly
former Sweigard students, which explains their affection for the
material. For those not immersed in the milieu of high-school
wrestling, the film offers a few intriguing pointers, explaining how at
this age, for instance, a lower weight class is generally an advantage.
But the kids insights are overwhelmingly platitudinous, and without
Hickey and Ledgers feeling of investment in the teams success, its a
long haul to the championship.</p>]]></review>

So its a sweet surprise that this long-awaited Hollywood version has lightness in mind.</p><p>The movie is blessed by motormouthed Downey as billionaire tech genius Tony Stark, an apolitical man with stripper poles on his private plane. Despite the talk, this risky casting pays off beautifully. Downey imparts crucial verve to Favreaus static compositions; his glib Stark, launching smart bombs between Scotch sips and busting out of Afghan terrorist captivity with a half-amused shrug, is dangerously appealing in a P.J. ORourke way.</p><p>Of course, <i>Iron Man</i> becomes about Starks reawakening: Struck by conscience, he closes his arms factoryand for a giddy moment, you wonder if a studio movie might be taking on the whole of the military-industrial complex. But here, actually, is the sole problem with the film: Suddenly, its too conventional. It doesnt take a rocket scientist to correctly identify Jeff Bridgess bald exec as the Halliburtonian antagonist-to-be. But <i>Iron Man</i> is one blockbuster that cant end with a typical mano a mano slugfest, no matter how roboticized and <i>Transformers</i>-like. We want planes, tanks, enraged Congressional speeches. Such is the promise of the character that you feel like the franchise will get there. (Many hints are planted.) Then well really see some heavy.</p>]]></review>

A sucker for a princess (Watson) in distress, Despereaux sets out to rescue her when the king lets their sovereignty fall into gloomy disrepair.</p><p>The miniature realm of <i>The Tale of Despereaux</i> is crammed full of detail. Villainous rats inhabit a sleazy city port thats ripe for animated trips down pits and up never-ending staircases; the action takes place on the vertical as much as it does the horizontal. The characters are imaginatively rendered, too: The mice are reassuringly cute, and in a CGI homage to a ye olde English mythological figure, the Green Man makes an appearance in the royal household as a magically summoned harvest of cherry eyes, apple cheeks and peapod mouth. The humans, though, are a case study in stereotyping; its hard to care what happens to Princess Pea when shes just a whiny British toff, waiting for a prince with a phallic-looking noggin to save her.</p>]]></review>

Taking in the films light-dappled deep-sea footage may be the next

facilitates a closer understanding of the life aquatic. Still, the
films rigorous commitment to probing the undersea kingdoms oddities
separates it from the usual tepid Discovery Channel fare, and those
looking for marine exotica and savagery will thrill to a sea slug that

How times have changed. Once Upon a Time now looks like an over-cooked mess of style, metaphor and reference, while Pat strides ahead, every bit the poetic modern masterpiece. Charles Bronson is the squinty cipher pitted against a countercast Henry Fonda in a tale of bloody revenge that takes numerous detours into areas of property law and corporate malaise, only to conclude with the displacement of man (the humble cowpoke) by his distant, cold-hearted brethren, the businessman. In technical terms, scenes such as the operatic opening shoot-out are hard to fault,but this is a film that rewards the eyes and ears without properly considering the heart and head.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[He turns 80 this year and claims Gran Torino was his last outing as an actor. But, as a director, Clint Eastwood is keeping his nose to the grindstone. He spent the end of 2009 filming a Peter Morgan-penned thriller, Hereafter, in Europe and the US, and earlier last year decamped to South Africa to film this respectful, rousing drama about Nelson Mandelas canny co-opting of the 1995 Rubgy World Cup Finals as a tool to promote racial harmony across the social and political tinderbox that was the new, post-apartheid state.<br /><br />Eastwood isnt a director to indulge in shades of grey and so the films first scenes of the historic, televised release of Mandela (Morgan Freeman) from prison in 1990 are preceded by a shot of white boys playing rugby on one side of the road while their black equivalents kick a football on the other. Simple imagery: a background of division established  job done.<br />A similar, no-nonsense efficiency colours the whole film, which jumps forward to Mandelas inauguration in 1994, again mixing reconstruction and news footage, before ditching this early documentary feel to settle into a behind-the-scenes walk-through of the early months of his presidency. This was a time when existing presidential staff wrongly expected to be booted out of their jobs; a black civil-rights group believed, also wrongly, that Mandela would support their desire to change the name and colours of the national rugby team; and somewhere in a white suburb the captain of that same team, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) and his family were shaking their heads at the assumption that their country was heading to the dogs.<br />Eastwood and writer Anthony Peckham further stress South Africas lingering disharmony through a chorus of Mandelas bodyguards, for which existing, white heavies are joined by new, black counterparts. Between them, they trade insults and glares like boxers before a fight. Again, its a simple tool, useful enough but marred by some substandard local actors. All praise to Eastwood for casting on the ground; less praise to him for allowing them to disrupt his movie with their awkward presence.<br />From here, its valuable life lessons all round as Mandela invites Pienaar to tea, joins the rugby team in training and  famously  strides on to the pitch at the South Africa v New Zealand final wearing the same Springboks shirt that a year earlier was a divisive symbol of the old nation. Security tensions at this match offer Eastwood an unnecessary sideshow as he tries and fails to insert a thriller element into the film by hinting at a bomb attack or assassination attempt  real fears at the time, but out of place here. A shot of an aircraft flying above the stadium plays on post-9/11 fears  but would anyone in 1995 have suspected a low-flying passenger plane of terrorism?<br />Both leads are effective, and Damon is very good at displaying Pienaars conservatism cracking in the glare of Mandelas wise optimism. Freeman is perhaps too stately, but its a thankless task trying to pull off an impersonation of such a public figure. Hes more at ease in intimate scenes, although on a technical level, his accent raises the odd eyebrow.<br />Invictus isnt one of Eastwoods best films, especially judged against the late flowering of his career since 2003s Mystic River. But its still a noble and compassionate work that in its later scenes manages successfully to invest our emotions in the triumph of an important  if overlong!  sporting victory. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Documentaries can be the victims of bad timing, and thats to some extent the case with <i>Floored</i>,
which chronicles the plight of veteran Chicago futures traders as they
struggle to adapt to new, fast-paced computer technologies. Smith has
had the interesting idea to examine a sliver of the financial sector
thats struggling with obsolescence (as opposed to whining about
slightly less oversized bonuses), and the interviewees range from fat
cats to burnouts. But of course floor trading is essentially gambling
for a living, and every other industry on earth is in crisis too. At
times this myopic, incomplete-feeling portraitwhich ends in September
2008plays like special pleading.</p><p>Its not fun unless you can
die, recalls former trader Mike Walsh, remembering the time he was
rhino hunting in Africa. That sort of bluster makes many of these
subjects less than sympathetic, but the movie takes pains to counteract
perceived audience antipathy: It notes that several of the traders
dont even have college backgrounds, and it repeatedly emphasizes the
integrity of Chicagos pit, ostensibly the last exchange floor on
earth where traders are man enough to shove and spit at each other.
Like much of the economy itself, those shows of pride were illusory.</p>]]></review>

Thats not a knock on the glories of the Leonard Bernstein score and Stephen Sondheims wonderful lyrics. This tale of star-crossed lovers set against a background of ethnic gangs in 1950s New York is all about big swoony emotions captured in song and, exuberantly, in dance. And even if you find yourself a bit distracted by the weird casting (Wood and Chakiris play Puerto Ricans, and many of the Jets have weird blond dye jobs, perhaps to enhance the contrast between the gangs), you have to admire the way every aspect of the film works toward the emotional impact.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>How can we make use of accomplished actors when they have moved
beyond their romantic-lead years and into the elder-statesman phase?
Judging from recent examples, the options are limited. They can go for
the hambone larger-than-life roles (Christopher Plummer in <i>The Last Station</i>), the eccentric old coot roles (Hal Holbrook in <i>That Evening Sun</i>, Robert Duvall in the upcoming <i>Get Low</i>), or the coots spikier cousin, the dangerous old get-off-my-lawn crank gone ballistic (Clint Eastwood in <i>Gran Torino</i>).
Until now, Caine has mostly avoided these traps. So what in the name of
all that is holy made him say yes to this grim, hammer-to-the-skull
obvious vigilante flick? Is he dreaming of the old days, when he
starred in the wonderful revenge drama <i>Get Carter</i>?</p><p>Like Eastwoods character in <i>Gran Torino</i>,
Harry Brown is an anachronism, an earnest, tidy man living in a
public-housing estate in south London that has descended into chaos.
Skinhead punks rule the streets, dealing drugs, robbing people and in
general making it impossible to live with your head held high.
Ex-marine Harry suffers it all until his best pal (Bradley) gets
murdered. Then Harry goes about taking out the thugs who killed his
pal, one by bloody one. An earnest but ineffectual police inspector
(Mortimer) suspects he might be involved, but her superiors dismiss her
idea that the old geezer is behind it. Then the housing estate erupts
in violence, and things get really, really crazy.</p><p>Barber films
this angry vengeance flick in an unrelenting greenish palette that
suggests south London has a serious algae problem, and the score pounds
audience members into their seats with all the subtlety of Wagners
Ring cycle. Someone needs to explain to Barber that when film buffs wax
nostalgic about the 1970s, theyre not referring to <i>Death Wish</i>.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Temperamentally disinclined to put down his camcorder, ever, an
eccentric Frenchman named Thierry Guetta sets out to make a documentary
about street art. Connections lead him not only to figures like Shepard
Fairey (whose iconic Obama HOPE image went viral) but also Banksy,
the notorious, pseudonymous British underground artist known for both
the extreme secrecy surrounding his identity and the risks he takes for
his artfacing Israeli army fire to paint on the West Bank wall, for
instance. Because his paintings and sculptures are ephemeral, Banksy
reasonshis face is obscured by a hoodie and his voice is digitally
tweakedwhy not immortalize them on video? But that summary only
scratches the surface of this dizzying film essay, which seeks to
confound the lines between free expression and crime, mainstream and
counterculture, fame and obscurity and filmmaker and subject. (Note
whos credited as director.)</p><p>To reveal more would spoil the
movies surprises, which many, not unreasonably, have questioned as a
sort of prank in themselves. It doesnt make much difference: Guetta
and Banksys invasion of Disneyland would be hilarious both as fiction
and something stranger than fiction, and the final act crosses over to
the Twilight Zone. As an investigation into the creation of artistic
celebrity, the movie may not be as ingenious as Orson Welless similar <i>F for Fake</i>. But as far as stunt documentaries go, Banksy is the new Borat.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Its <i>Dangerous Liaisons</i> versus <i>Valmont</i>or <i>Capote</i> versus <i>Infamous</i>all
over again. But the question of why we needed two movies on the rise of
Chess Records is less interesting than the question of why we needed
one: Now we can decide which is the <i>less</i> conventional biopic. Directed by Broadway musical veteran Jerry Zaks, <i>Who Do You Love</i> has a considerably lower budget but is in some respects more original than 2008s chart-climb montage-fest <i>Cadillac Records</i>,
and it offers a more dynamic take on its central character. Alessandro Nivolas
Leonard Chess is much more of a monomaniacal creep than Adrien Brodys
affable entrepreneur, and the movie takes genuine interest both in his
ongoing tug-of-war with Muddy Waters (David Oyelowo) and in the song-making
process. Theres also a vivid sense of the skepticism Chess faced in
crossing racial boundaries in 40s and 50s Chicago.</p><p>Of course,
its still a biopic, with a rote moral about a visionary whos too
devoted to his work for his family or this world. (The fate of his
mistress, Ivy Mills, the movies radically repurposed Etta James
figure, will baffle anyone even broadly acquainted with the history.)
Louisiana plays Chicago, and for all the movies welcome prickliness,
thats about as convincing as it gets.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival</i><br />Dr Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) is an ageing but ageless impresario, thousands of years old, who runs a travelling theatre, a horse-drawn, rickety piece of Victoriana that he and his  daughter Valentina (Lily Cole), company clown Anton (Andrew Garfield) and little man Percy (Verne Troyer) drive through the streets of an especially dismal and rainy modern London. When a rowdy, drunken Geordie storms the stage and falls through the mirror at its centre, we realise that this is no ordinary theatre: the mirror is an opportunity for characters to tumble into parallels worlds conceived by the director and writer team of Terry Gilliam and Charles McKeown, who previously worked together on Brazil, Time Bandits and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen<br />This fantasy land behind the mirror is forever changing: the landscape might one minute look like a Dali painting and the next like the most primary-coloured, pastoral of scenes where giant clay heads spread their long tongues over the landscapes or people walk on broken, huge ladders like stilts. You might also find tributes to those who died young, such as Rudolph Valentino, James Dean and Princess Diana  tributes that float sombrely down a river in boats. Back in London, the theatre troupe stumble across a strange character, Tony (Heath Ledger), the shady head of a childrens charity, who is hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in the middle of a suicide attempt. They release this mystery man, who with his white suit and ponytail has the air of a spiv, and allow him to join their troupe, so helping Parnassus with a wager he has with the devil (Tom Waits). <br />Who knows how Gilliams The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus would have turned out if Ledger had not died halfway through production? Certainly, Gilliam wouldnt have had to introduce Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell as various refractions of Ledgers character halfway through the film, a device that works fairly well, not least because each of the actors try very hard, through costume, hair and gestures, to mirror the late actor. Some of the accompanying dialogue to explain these transformations is a bit awkward, but only the hardest of souls wouldnt forgive this attempt to rescue something positive from a tragedy. <br />The real problem is that most of the film is a bit of a mess, even if you have to respect Gilliams untiring celebration of the imagination and his daring in taking his story down some wild and crazy roads that would have narrative purists tearing out their hair. At its worst, this is dressing-up-box cinema, scrappy and directionless, and some of the films lengthy, animated fantasy sections feel as improvised as its splurge of weak ideas, poor acting and uninspiring location work in London. Its still intriguing, though, to see how Gilliam reacted, as a filmmaker, to Ledgers death and, of course, to see Ledger in his final role. His performance isnt one of his best and lacks some of the wild charisma of the Joker, say, in a role that could easily have been taken down such eccentric routes. His acting colleagues Depp, Law and Farrell all make the best of a bad job and both Garfield and Cole are intermittently exuberant if always appearing a little undirected. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The Pixar crew have been smugly ensconced as kings of their computer-animated castle for a while now, secure in the knowledge that while the other animation houses  with their sass-talking sloths and farting ogres  might amuse the little uns for a couple of hours, theyd never trouble the pantheon of cartoon greats. Sony Picturess Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs may not scale the artistic heights of a Finding Nemo or Wall-E, but its the most satisfying and original non-Pixar CG animated movie to hit screens in a while.<br />On a remote island principality in the mid-Atlantic, the populace have been living on sardines since the canned-fish market dried up. So plucky young scientist Flint Lockwood, inventor of overactive hair-unbalder and spray-on shoes (which you can never remove), commits himself to solving the problem. His answer is a machine which turns water into food, creating anything from sliced pizza to ice cream with toppings. Its a success  until a freak accident happens, the machine goes berserk, and it starts to rain cheeseburgers.<br />The makers of the film are not remotely interested in pop-culture references or celebrity cameos: the voice cast favours stalwarts like Anna Faris and James Caan over inappropriate A-listers. Banishing such petty distractions frees director Phil Lord to focus on more important issues, like story and character: the plot is wonderfully twisty, building to an eyeball-frazzling culinary climax of truly epic proportions. The characters are equally well drawn, from self-absorbed, overambitious doofus Flint to his expressionless but somehow heartbreaking sad-sack dad, Tim. <br />But the films greatest pleasure  and the element that sets it apart from its smarmy, in-jokey predecessors  is its bizarre sense of humour. Fusing snappy one-liners with a kid-friendly seam of slapstick incorporating everything from talking monkeys to homicidal Gummi Bears, the script provokes comparison with comedy from The Marx Brothers to The Mighty Boosh. This sense of unpredictability, coupled with some breathlessly paced and visually stunning action scenes, makes this the animated success of 2009 at least until Up opens next month.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Franois Ozons intriguing modern-day parable could be glibly synopsized as the French flying baby movie, though that is as much of a feint as the films opening shot, which elegantly misdirects our attentions. A visibly shaken woman, Katie (the extraordinary Lamy), sits isolated in the frame, talking to an offscreen social worker. Background details slowly emergeher husband has left her; shes thinking of giving her baby son up for adoptionthat help to define her emotionally fraught, working-class existence. Then Ozon, playing on our expectations, cuts to a several months earlier flashback that suggests hell work his way back to this heartrending opening salvo. </p><p>Yet he never does. This turns out to be the first of several beautifully employed ellipses that signal a subtle shift in the films tone. For a while, it seems were in for a mostly grounded blue-collar love story between Katie and her coworker, Paco (Lpez). Then after an almost-invisible nine-month jump, Katie gives birth to a child, Ricky (Peyret), who pushes the tale toward the blatantly spiritual when he sprouts a pair of wings. It would be risible if Ozons hand didnt remain so steady and confident throughout, all the way up to a complicatedly upbeat conclusion that recreates the Christian Annunciation with the straightest of faces. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>For his first English-language film, Icelander Dagur Kri appears to be
under the spell of Jim Jarmusch and Charles Bukowski, with tips on
elevated diction from Damon Runyon. Irascible crank Jacques (Brian Cox) owns
the dingiest dive bar you've ever seen, where an eccentric crew of
regulars (a florist, a garbage-truck driver, a would-be novelist)
huddle and shoot the shit when Jacques isn't berating them in florid
language or temporarily banning them from the premises.</p><p>But
Jacques has a bad heart condition (symbolic title alert!) and worries
about passing on his legacy. So he takes in suicidal, homeless Lucas
(Paul Dano), who is such a blank slate that he wouldnt register at all if
it werent for Danos aggressive use of awkward postures to convey
character. (Honestly, at times it looks as if hes going to pull a
muscle from acting so hard.) Cox, meanwhile, is going for shabby
grandiloquent misanthropy, and plays every curmudgeonly grimace to the
balcony seats. Jacques tries to remake Lucas in his own bitter image,
but a flight attendant with a fear of flying (Isild Le Besco) disrupts their
equilibrium. </p><p>Quirk and sentimentality battle for supremacy, and
all thats missing to make this a perfect throwback to the worst
indulgences of early 90s indie cinema is a theremin in the score.
Instead we get tinny piano and some cellos. Close enough.</p>]]></review>

demonstrates a knack for conjuring an ominous mood and little else. A
grieving scientist (Bill Sage) prone to hallucinatory freakouts and
estranged from his colleagues spends his days building some sort of
machine. The nature of this project is never precisely clarified, but
the results of this experiment give him extrasensory abilities, opening
a window onto his neighbors marital discord. Suffice it to say, his ultimate use of his powers would not go
over well with NARAL.</p><p>Director Zach LeBeau flaunts his influences<i>The Conversation</i>, <i>Memento</i>, <i>Donnie Darko</i>, <i>Close Encounters</i>, possibly <i>Birth</i>but cinephilia alone isnt enough to sustain a movie. If <i>The Scientist</i>
is initially intriguing, mostly in a whats-going-on sort of way, its
spell dissipates the more it unravels. The signifiers of griefthe
protagonist maintains an alarmingly comprehensive collection of stuffed
animals, for instanceflirt with clich, and theres nothing inherently
interesting about a man losing his grip on reality, especially if the
escalation of madness is so quick. The title character claims Einstein
is a crank, but its his own movie that suffers from a failure of
vision.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>As you might assume from the title, this is basically an extended redo of Sergio Leones <i>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</i>,
transplanted to 1930s Manchuria. A rifle-wielding bounty hunter (Jung),
a clownish outlaw (Song) and a ruthless killer (Lee) with Asian
pop-star hair chase each other while killing off a few hundred extras
and a lot of horses. And yes, the score has twangy guitar, plunky
banjo, some inspired whistling and a chorus grunting roughly Hee ho
hoo. So far so Leone. But where Leone specialized in the artful
building of suspense punctuated with short bursts of gunplay, Kim opts
for extended battle scenes in which bullets fly and most of the sets
are reduced to piles of rubble. The operatic slow burn of Leone has
been replaced with something a little more contemporaryrelentless
action.</p><p>Not that theres anything wrong with that. Kims good at
his job and knows just when to throw in something silly, like the
outlaw donning a diving helmet as armor during a gunfight. Frankly, we
prefer Leones intensity (and Clint Eastwoods glaring eyes in giant
close-up) over Kims brutal kineticism, but wed take this unusual
hybrid over a lot of contemporary Hollywood CGI mayhem-fests.</p>]]></review>

Its the same argument Michael Moore made in <i>Sicko,</i> but it bears repeating.</p><p>Wilson is unabashedly on the side of the patients and the Lyme literate doctors dedicated to treating them. But he gives solid screen time to physicians who describe it as a straightforward, treatable infection with a limited range of non-life-threatening symptoms; the gulf between the two positions is alarming. The trouble with Lyme, the film stops just short of suggesting, is that the medical industry would like to wish the disease away because its such a pain in the ass.

      <review><![CDATA[<p>From very early in <i>The Square</i>, its clear that things are
not going to go well for Raymond (David Roberts), a building contractor whos
carrying on an affair with Carla (Claire van der Boom), a younger woman who
lives across a shark-infested bay. Its just simple plot economy; you
dont make reference to shark-infested bays without said sharks getting
to dine. Without spoiling things, well note that screenwriters Joel
Edgerton (the directors brother) and Matthew Dabner know the rules,
and know how to tweak them a bit. That makes <i>The Square</i> an enjoyable take on very familiar film-noir ideas.</p><p>When
Carla learns her husband, Greg (Anthony Hayes), is hiding a big bag of money
(definitely of the ill-gotten variety) in the house, she persuades
Raymond to steal the money, burn down the house to cover the crime and
run away together. Even without a <i>Double Indemnity</i>style
voiceover, you know this plan is going to go wrong, but its still fun
trying to figure out precisely how things will go wrong. Filmmaker Nash Edgerton
plays things straight and simple, without any fancy directorial
flourishes or attempts to pay homage to other films. Hes built a
simple mousetrap, not some baroque twisty contraption, but its a
clever mousetrap, and it suffices to catch the mouse.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Vincent P. Falk is that type beloved of newspaper columnists, the
local eccentric. If you spend any time at all in downtown Chicago, or
if youve taken any of the boat tours that run along the Chicago River,
youve probably seen him in his brightly colored suits, perhaps doing
his signature spin move. For this engaging doc, director Jennifer Burns starts from the
naive position you might have: wondering what his deal is and forming
your own hypothesis. Where does he get the money for all those suits?
Is he homeless? Is he crazy? Slowly but surely, Burns reveals new
aspects of Falks life, and each new revelation raises new questions.</p><p>Falks
story seems designed to hit a checklist of our prejudices and anxieties
about those who are outside the normal range. Hes clinically blind,
with sunken eyes. He has a purposeful but oddly jerky walk. He talks in
a rapid-fire but monotone stream. Hes hungry for attention (hence the
suits) but keeps people at arms length with his puns and performance.
Without getting into clinical diagnoses, Burns lets us see that Vincent
is both very smart (he works as a computer programmer for Cook County)
but also, well, odd. You may throw your own layman diagnosis
(high-functioning autistic?), but it seems to be part of the point of
this doc that spending time getting to know Falk as an individual makes
labels seem reductive and ultimately pointless. Burns could tighten
this up a bit, and we could have lived without the overly cutesy score,
but this doc gets beyond that local eccentric label to suggest that
Falk, like anyone else, is a complex person, deserving of
acknowledgment rather than pity or derision.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[There are pigs and geese and horses and sheep and a spider and a rat in
this new film adaptation of E. B. Whites beloved childrens book.
Theres also an elephant in the room, and its name is Babe. Comparisons to that film are inevitable. Charlottes may not live up to Babe, but its reasonable family entertainment. 

          
		  



Screenwriters Susannah Grant and Karey Kirkpatrick have remained
pleasingly faithful to the book. Strong-willed little Fern (Fanning)
saves Wilbur (Kay), the runt of a pig litter, from the ax, then sends
him across the road to her uncles farm. There, Wilbur learns the fate
that awaits pigs on farms (rhymes with Macon),
a discovery that causes him understandable distress. But he also makes
a new friend in Charlotte (Roberts, all gentleness and silk), the
spider who makes her web above his pigpen. To save Wilbur, Charlotte
begins writing words of praise about him in her web (Some pig). The
humans buy the advertising and take Wilbur to the county fair, where
his friendship with Charlotte faces a final heartbreaking test.
The fundamental sweetness of the message is nicely tempered (as it
is in the book, which we highly recommend revisiting) by the cruel
facts of life. Creatures are born and die, and what matters in between
is the friends you make. Not a bad message for the kids, and its
delivered pretty effectively.]]></review>

Heavily mannered compositions and histrionic performances exist within a freeform narrative into which Neshat insouciantly slips the odd magical realist miracle or fantasy sequence.

      <review><![CDATA[<p>In Japan at the time of World War II, the emperor was, by tradition, regarded as a divine figure. <i>The Sun</i>
imagines the moment when he was brought down to earthnamely, his
surrender to the Allies. Hirohito is the third leader to be featured in
Sokurovs dictator trilogy, after Hitler (1999s <i>Moloch</i>) and Lenin (2001s <i>Taurus</i>). Always an eccentric chronicler of historyhis most famous film remains <i>Russian Ark</i>
(2002), an astonishing single-take pageant shot in the
HermitageSokurov is once again willfully perverse in his focus here.
With a few powerful exceptions, he leaves the sense of death in the
background, isolating us instead in the emperors quarters. The opening
scenes find Hirohito (Ogata, reportedly breaking a taboo on playing the
role) immersed in marine biology, at times seemingly oblivious to the
world outside. </p><p>The early sequences are glacially paced, but
they build to Hirohitos meeting with Douglas MacArthur (Dawson). (In
one of the most dynamic moments, Hirohito shames MacArthurs Japanese
translator by choosing to conduct the meeting in English.) Its
difficult to say whether Dawsons performance is deliberately
exaggerated in its imperiousness or whether Sokurov just doesnt have
much of an ear for English, but the choice works, giving an
otherworldly quality to the two mens miscommunications. Indeed, the
movie sometimes resembles science fiction in its portrait of a foggy,
emptied-out Japan. It also demonstrates an oddball sense of humor, as
when the emperors staff receives a present of Hershey bars from the
Americans. Sokurov examines an epochal moment in history as if through
a microscopeseeking the mundane in the epic.</p>]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Period/Swashbucklers]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[From the director of "Gladiator"! scream the posters, and youd be forgiven for expecting a straight rerun of that Oscar-winning hit - a film that swaps togas and short swords for Lincoln green and feathered arrows. But this Robin Hood is a more unpredictable beast: while the shakycam action sequences, effete young villain and moody presence of Russell Crowe hark back to the earlier film, this is far closer to Scotts ambitious but unloved Kingdom of Heaven in its depiction of a world ruled by brute force and striving for moral direction.<br />The opening act could even work as a sequel to that film: fighting his way back from the Crusades in the army of Richard the Lionheart, archer Robin Longstride decides to head for home when the King gets an arrow in the neck. By a series of unbelievable coincidences, Robin finds himself posing as deceased nobleman Robert Locksley, charged with taking news of the Lionhearts death back to his troublesome brother, the new King John (Oscar Isaac).<br />This kickstarts the long series of subterfuges, political dirty deals and full-scale treachery that constitute the films wildly convoluted story. It's plots aplenty: King John plots against his former Chancellor, Marshall (a stately William Hurt); traitor Godfrey (Mark Strong) plots against John, Robin and the entire English nation in concert with the devious King Philip of France; while Maid Marian (Cate Blanchett) and her ailing father-in-law (Max von Sydow) plot to keep Robin in Nottingham in the guise of the former Lord Locksley.<br />Confused? You will be. Anyone expecting a straightforward woodland beat-em-up will be bemused and most likely dismayed by the intricacies of the narrative, particularly when it becomes clear that Scott has been forced to trim back the action to fit in all these dastardly goings-on. Add a complete absence of characterisation, some laughable accents (Crowe sounds like hes auditioning for Coronation Street) and a sense of history that would make Simon Schama scream, and youve got the makings of what should be a tedious, overblown disaster.<br />But for all his faults, Scott knows what hes doing. The film looks terrific: the English landscape hasnt looked so lush and magical for a long time, particularly in a clutch of gorgeous moonlit night scenes. Aesthetically it's convincing, which goes a long way towards offsetting the more nutty convolutions in the plot. And while characterisation has been cut to the bone, Crowe, Blanchett, Strong and especially Von Sydow remain eminently watchable, with strong, likeable support from the likes of Mark Addy as Friar Tuck and Matthew MacFadyen as a marvellously greasy Sheriff of Nottingham.<br />Best of all, the film just feels huge: genuinely epic in a way few movies have since Lord of the Rings. The endless plot twists may be perplexing, but they work to make the movie feel eventful and involving: after 140 minutes, audiences will feel like theyve been somewhere, lived through something. And so, while this Robin Hood is a long way from perfect, it remains a satisfyingly immense and old fashioned grand-canvas experience.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Austrian director Jessica Hausner, once a pupil of Michael Haneke (and credited on imdb.com, not very flatteringly, as script girl on Funny Games), takes her cameras to the French Pyrenean pilgrimage site of Lourdes for her third film, a mysterious, French-language ensemble piece about the role of miracles in the modern world. Hausners focus is on a youngish French woman, Christine (Sylvie Testud), one of a large group of pilgrims being shepherded around by Lourdess Order of Malta volunteers, a gang of young helpers dressed like fascists moonlighting as members of the St John Ambulance. But Hausner is wary of focusing too much on Christine, preferring to give equal billing to Lourdes itself and her wider group of pilgrims.<br /><br />The characters are scripted, but the places are real, and part of the films thrill, especially when coupled with Hausners often inscrutable attitude towards the place, is to watch her drama unfolding in such a location, both creepy and magical, dour and uplifting. Hausner has been given a privilege and she uses it wisely.<br /><br />Gradually, though, the drama tightens around Christine, whom we observe at closer quarters than the others. She is frail, pretty and blonde; shes also living with multiple sclerosis and is unable to move her body below the neck. Christines religious beliefs are unclear (I prefer the cultural trips, she says) but the pilgrimage is having a strange effect on her and soon shes the focus of everyones attention. Are we witnessing a miracle? Is Christine manipulating the situation? Is she really ill? And are we cruel even to entertain that last thought?<br />The beauty of Hausners film is that just when you think shes going to take a sneering swipe at Lourdes, its tacky trinkets and deluded visitors, the film takes a much less easy  and more inquiring  turn. Like Haneke, Hausner is more comfortable opening a debate than closing it. Some things are clear, though. Her photography is exquisite, evoking religious icons, and her mastery of directing such a group of actors at this exceptional location allows the film to maintain a strong ensemble feel while never losing sight of the mysterious story at its core. Theres also a delicious streak of black humour that runs through the film and stops it from becoming too pious or maudlin. The result is a provocative and surprising pleasure that may persuade even the most hardened rationalists to reconsider what religion means as a sanctity to those who have few other choices in life.]]></review>

It crosses familiar territory as it follows Martin's efforts to reaquaint himself with his 11-year-old son, ex-wife and old prison chums, cope with innovations (train ticket machines, Gameboys) and a panoply of worklessness, homelessness and complex social security provisions.

      <review><![CDATA[
This comic update of the world crystallised by Raymond Chandler charts the disastrous involvement of laidback dopehead Jeff 'the Dude' Lebowski (Bridges) in a kidnapping case involving the wife of his millionaire namesake (Huddleston). The Dude is hired as bagman and of course finds himself increasingly at risk as he makes his way about an LA populated by the rich, strange and dangerous. Nor do his bowling buddies help: Donny (Buscemi) is frankly several pins short of a strike; while Walter (Goodman), a crazed, irascible Viet vet, is so determined to stand his (and the Dude's) ground that he causes more trouble than he solves. Immensely inventive and entertaining, the film may not have the enigmatic elegance or emotional resonance of <i>Barton Fink</i> or <i>Fargo, </i>but it's still a prime example of the Coens' effortless brand of stylistic and storytelling brilliance. Thanks to Roger Deakins' gleaming camerawork, T-Bone Burnett's eclectic soundtrack selection and the Coens' typically pithy dialogue, it looks and sounds wonderful. Moreover, far from being shallow pastiche, it's actually about something: what it means to be a man, to be a friend, and to be a 'hero' for a particular time and place.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Taking his erstwhile teen lovers into young adulthood, marriage and parenthood, John Hughes fashions a curiously disaffected portrait of the artist as a frustrated chauvinist. Bacon - an aspiring writer who lands a job in advertising, just as Hughes did - narrates the film. We are privy to his daydreams about freedom and his resentment towards his bride (McGovern in a terrible role), and then we watch his change of heart in a thoroughly unconvincing last reel. This is bitter-sweet compartmentalised, with the saccharine spooned on at the end. Even then it lacks flavour.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Brooks' <i>Star Wars</i> spoof employs the familiar scattergun approach, featuring gags old and new, something borrowed and something blue. Typically, the best conceits end in pratfalls, and non-Brooks fans may find that the gravitational pull towards the thumpingly obvious outweighs the wit. The story is a chip off the old Lucas block, with Darth Vader translated into the pipsqueak Dark Helmet (Moranis), The Force into The Schwartz, and Luke Skywalker becomes the slobbish space bum Lone Starr (Pullman), accompanied by his trusty dog Barf (Candy). The director's 2000-year-old man turns up, as well as a Druish princess (Zuniga) threatened with the return of her old nose. A flying Winnebago, a giant vacuum cleaner, and controls marked Light Speed and Ludicrous Speed get plenty of play, and there's a protracted rib-nudge as Brooks lets us in on the mystery of filming before proceeding to advertise Spaceball merchandise. In short, it is all exactly as you would imagine.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
If it weren't for the closing spasm of gratuitous, humanist optimism, <i>Rashomon</i> could be warmly recommended as one of Kurosawa's most inventive and sustained achievements. The main part of the film, set in 12th century Kyoto, offers four mutually contradictory versions of an ambush, rape and murder, each through the eyes of one of those involved. The view of human weaknesses and vices is notably astringent, although the sheer animal vigour of Mifune's bandit is perhaps a celebration of a sort. The film is much less formally daring than its literary source, but its virtues are still plentiful: Kurosawa's visual style at its most muscular, rhythmically nuanced editing, and excellent performances.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Inspired by <i>The Arabian Nights</i>, Reiniger's charming silhouette animation was perhaps the first ever feature cartoon. Released in Germany in 1926 to a lukewarm reception, it proved a smash in Paris, where it was championed by Jean Renoir and the avant garde as a work of rare artistry and fluid beauty. Today, with allowances for some racial and sexual stereotyping, it impresses for its exquisite craftmanship, balletic movement, expressive romanticism and moments of potent sensuousness and poetry. In the days of super-expensive CGI technology and ever growing armies of animation technicians, it's worth noting that Reiniger and husband Carl Koch were a two-person factory. Ex-actress Reiniger designed and made all the articulated foot-high cutouts herself; Koch was in charge of the camera, and Walter Ruttmann and Berthold Bartosch helped with the special effects and backgrounds. As the original negative was lost, the DVD is based on the tinted restoration of the NFTVA answer print (1999); thankfully, the syrupy music added in the '50s has been replaced by Wolfgang Zeller's romantic original score.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its almost tempting to see this reissue of Martin Scorseses uncomfortably visceral, neon-lit portrait of psychotic urban alienation as the NFTs sly riposte to Superman Returns  a lesson in the dangers of unchecked Messianism and the urge to cure a sick world. In fact its showing as part of the season devoted to composer Bernard Herrmann, whose remarkable score  completed hours before his death in December 1975  offers our best chance of understanding increasingly unhinged zero-tolerance cabbie Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) on his own terms. <br />A vet who takes to nocturnal cab-driving as a distraction from chronic insomnia, Bickle is a casualty of the sex war as well as Vietnam, seeking to rescue first Presidential campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) and then juvenile prostitute Iris (12-year-old Jodie Foster, already adept at spinning humiliation into self-reliance) from what he perceives as the cesspit of Manhattan. Scorsese offers a fair bit of support for this perspective, from the banal closed-mindedness of Bickles fellow drivers to the directors own cameo as a murderously jealous passenger.<br />Initially, De Niros performance is a masterclass in contained indignation and a creepy willingness to be amused; Herrmanns bluesy saxophone voices Bickles world-weary romanticism even as cymbal and snare crescendos hint at seismic ructions rumbling underneath. Once set on a course of self-aggrandising retribution, the score echoes his determination, with martial horns and drums unnervingly offset by the hysterical harp of a self-appointed avenging angel. Yet when the metal trap into which Bickle has translated his body is sprung, the resulting carnage  still horrific two decades on  unfolds without music, before Scorsese ushers us into a profoundly unsettling coda. New York may have changed, but Taxi Driver is as powerful and painful as ever.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The setting is confined to a lifeboat in the Atlantic occupied by survivors from a torpedoed passenger-carrying freighter and the commander of the U-Boat responsible (Slezak). The idea was to contrast the singleminded Nazi against democracy's comparatively feeble representatives, but the script, started by Steinbeck and finished by Hitchcock, appears too calculated. It's worth seeing, though, for Hitchcock's handling of actors in a confined setting, which incidentally introduces an elusive sense of size, a perspective that is heightened by much of the film being shot in close or semi-close-up. Half the time you'd swear the lifeboat is enormous.]]></review>

Bible and firepower. Kraus's short, no-frills profile is a model of 
fly-on-the-wall filmmaking: no narration or music, just Hewett reasonably going 
about his business. In one sense, it's a blinding glimpse of the obvious: Like 
almost everyone else, Hewett is more complicated than he first appears. But in 
these fiercely polarized times, there's no downside to a reminder that not every 
beefy, God-talking sheriff is a bigoted cracker itching to throw your Yankee ass 
in Hellhole County Jail.

      <review><![CDATA[German-Turkish director Akin follows Alexander Hacke, musical director on Akins sensational Head-On and bassist with punk outfit Einstrzende Neubauten, around Istanbul recording the citys eclectic music scene. Hacke meets hairy rockers, fervent buskers, wrecked Romanies, persecuted Kurds and crinkly popsters, as well as some of the nicest  yet still credible  rappers youre ever likely to encounter. The film touches on the politics of the Turkish music biz (apparently Kurdish music videos were only broadcast on TV for the first time a few months before Hackes trip, allegedly to curry favour with the EU), but Hackes explicit refusal to make sense of the remarkable mishmash arguably hamstrings the otherwise enjoyable proceedings.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Carrie Bradshaw (Parker) and her fashion-conscious gal pals are
back, and theyre taking the girl-power high jinks to a whole new
level. First things first, though: the gay, gay, gay wedding of bestest
friends Anthony Marantino (Mario Cantone) and Stanford Blatch (Willie
Garson), where chorus boys sing Sunrise, Sunset, swans frolic among
the guests and Liza Minnelli officiates. Watching that queerest of
queer icons risk her umpteenth hip replacement by performing Beyoncs
Single Ladies (dance moves and all!) is as suspenseful as a Hitchcock
set piece, and a difficult act to top. So writer-director King doesnt
even try. Instead, after this rest-home Sasha Fierce overture, were
plunged headfirst into Carrie and friends familiar mock-troubled
paradise: Ms. Bradshaws relationship with the debonair Mr. Big (Noth)
is moving further toward stifling domesticity. Neurotic mother
Charlotte (Davis) is worried her braless live-in nanny has the hots for
her hubby. Lawyer Miranda (Nixon) quits her job after too many
put-downs from her chauvinist boss. And Samantha (Cattrall) is, well,
horny as fuck. What a great time to take an all-expenses-paid trip to
Abu Dhabi!</p><p>Under the rule of this formidable foursome, the big,
bad Middle East becomes a menopausalist Westerners delight. One
wrongheaded jaw-dropper follows another, from Samanthas description of
a gay manservant as Paula Abdul to a comic climax in which the ladies
escape an angry male mob by wearing hijabs and abayas given to them by
like-minded Muslim women. And the featherbrained feminism the franchise
specializes in reaches its apex when Carrie files her latest book (<i>I Do. Do I?</i>) beside Susan Sontags <i>Against Interpretation</i>. How do you say, In your dreams, girlfriend in Arabic?</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[After Hot Shots!, Austin Powers and Team America, is there still mileage in the slapstick action-movie pastiche? Based on a recurring Saturday Night Live sketch  itself inspired by 80s cheeseball spy show MacGyver  MacGruber sees SNL stalwart Will Fortes titular secret agent rousted from a jungle retreat and pressed into CIA service in an effort to track down Val Kilmers nuclear-warhead-wielding terrorist, Dieter von Cunth. That name typifies the kind of humour on offer: amusing enough the first time, but increasingly unfunny on the thirty-third. There are a handful of quality gags  most of them at the expense of mullet-man MacGrubers Clarksonesque fashion sense  and Forte surrounds himself with solid performers, notably Kilmer as the preening psychopath and Powers Boothe as a grouchy CIA bigwig. <br />But it all feels terribly routine, and as the script attempts to paper over the gaps between good gags with graphic sex, extreme violence and pratfalls, it becomes clear that this particular well has run bone dry.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Out of the shadows of Mamma Mia! creeps this hysterically silly, sun-soaked yarn of love lost and found in Italy with a story that feels like its been scribbled on the side of a jar of Ragu and an approach to filming Italy thats been nicked from an old Cornetto ad. Sophie (Amanda Seyfried; yes, this wants to be Mamma Mia! without songs) is a lowly fact-checker at The New Yorker who takes a pre-wedding trip to Verona with her restaurateur boyfriend Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal, smiling and waving his hands about like a nutter). But, once in Europe, Gael is off snouting for truffles and Sophie is left to discover a cadre of writers who ritually reply to notes left at the citys shrine to Shakespeares Juliet. Soon, Sophie is penning one such note herself to Claire (Vanessa Redgrave, distinguished amid the nonsense), an elderly Brit whose letter to an Italian sweetheart has been sitting behind a brick for decades. And what do you know? Claire turns up to search the Italian countryside with Sophie for her long-lost Lorenzo  along with her grumpy hunk of a grandson, Charlie (Christopher Egan, actually Australian, which explains why he acts like a surfboard).<br />Is there any point wondering why some of these actors ignored the script and agreed to spend several weeks working in the glorious Italian countryside? But thank heavens for small mercies: someone must have realised in the edit that they might have a kitsch classic on their hands as theres at least a knowing sense of camp alongside the dire performances and corny plotting.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Undeterred by the lacklustre Shrek the Third, the series returns for a fourth film  and this time, its gone sci-fi. Shrek ends up in a parallel universe after tiring of the monotony of both fatherhood and local celebrity. In his current life, no one is scared of him, and busloads of tourists peer at the swamp home he shares with wife Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and their cute green babies. So Shrek goes awol and bumps into a wandering little guy called Rumpelstiltstkin.<br />As fairy-tale fans will know, Rumpelstiltskin specialises in tricksy contracts. So when Shrek drunkenly signs an agreement to be a real ogre for a day in return for just one day of his life, he doesnt realise the catch. Suddenly, Shrek is thrown into a world in which ogres are hated, but Rumpel rules the kingdom, hosting all-day raves with black-clad witches and routinely scamming the quivering inhabitants of a depleted Far Far Away.<br />All very Back to the Future II, and its a fun twist that allows for a fresh perspective on familiar characters. Fiona is now a warrior princess, Donkey is a slave to the witches, and Puss? Well, lets just say hes been living the good life. The plots initially involving  and if its too complex for toddlers, it compensates with humour, visual invention and a 3D wow factor. This cant match the originals laugh count, though, and the story wears thin. Still, with warmth and charm, Shrek Forever After is an entertaining conclusion to the franchise  one that parents should happily endure. But lets hope thats all, folks.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Having cut his fangs on tween revenger Hard Candy and inventive bloodsucker 30 Days of Night, could director David Slade kick off a Harry Potter-like reinvigoration of the Twilight series? Well, sort of: Eclipse is a step up from the painfully anaemic New Moon, and its clearly the work of a filmmaker keen to put his own stamp on the series. But Slade is constrained at every turn by the sheer, crushing lifelessness of author Stephenie Meyers material.<br />Eclipse barely advances the story at all: were still stuck in the town of Forks, where moody heroine Bella (Kristen Stewart) is forced to choose between undead love-of-her-life Edward (Robert Pattinson) and musclebound werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner). There are lots of other characters  silly names are dropped with dizzying regularity  but none of them actually seem to do very much.<br />Slade directs with flair: his action sequences, though small in scale, have real drive, and a series of surprisingly grim Civil War flashbacks enable him to utilise a different visual palette from the usual drab greens and greys.<br /><br />But he cant disguise the massive flaws inherent in the screenplay: the slipshod plotting, whiny, self-serious tone and excruciating abstinence-first subplot. The biggest problem remains the characters: neither Slade nor Stewart are capable of turning manipulative whinger Bella into anything more than a joyless black hole sucking the life from every scene, while the only performer capable of giving her part any spark, Anna Kendrick, is completely sidelined this time around. Strictly for Twihards.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The extraordinary story of Ernest Shackleton's doomed expedition to the Antarctic in 1914 really doesn't need the grandiose verbosity of Kevin Spacey's voice-over narration, nor the bland, schools programming-style dramatic reconstruction it gets here. Imagine what James Cameron, say, could do with this material, but a straight documentary would also be fascinating. This mediocre halfway house benefits more from the archive photography and film shot at the time (familiar from the film <i>South</i>) than from the IMAX format. [Note: Butler also directed a non-IMAX version of the Shackleton story which was released simultaneously. <i>Shackleton's Legendary Antartic Adventure</i> runs 93 minutes and is narrated by Liam Neeson. - Ed.] TCh.]]></review>

fantasy-filmmaking ability ranks somewhere between nil and zilch. But
howzabout those Jake Gyllenhaal abs?!? Sorry, Gyllenhaalics: Theyre on
display only in an early scene, in which his Prince Dastan, a former
street urchin who earned a royal title by impressing his provinces
king, demonstrates some Bowflex-sculpted prowess in a brawl. From there
its all deltoid, all the timesmall consolation given the subvision
quest on which Dastan embarks after his adoptive monarch father is
murdered by a Ming the Merciless look-alike (Ben Kingsleys
eyeliner-loving vizier, Nizam). A spunky princess (Arterton) from a
rival city and a magical knife that holdsthe sands of time (!) figure
into the journey. But cmon, youre really here to see Alfred Molina in
brownface, giddily extolling the pleasures of ostrich racing, right?
Well, maybe not. </p><p>Back to those sands: It seems they hold the
power totake it away, Cher!turnbacktiii-me. But for only a minute
or so: For the real powerful flux-capacitor shit, you have to go to the
underground source. What will a megalomaniac like Nizam do, given
unlimited time-traveling power? Prevent Dastan from being born? Hit on
Lea Thompson? Stop himself from starring in <i>BloodRayne</i>? No,

      <review><![CDATA[A surprise summer hit in the States, this is another film-making-by-numbers exercise in teenage wish-fulfilment. A Jewish divorce moves to California from New Jersey, and her son, a male Carrie called Daniel, has terrible trouble fitting in with West Coast ways. His first incipient romance runs foul of the girl's ex, a blond thug who trains at the local karate dojo run by a deranged Vietnam veteran. Fortunately his E.T. comes along in the form of an elderly Okinawan karate master, who not only becomes his special, secret friend but also handily teaches him persistence, inner strength, moral values and karate - which lead him into an apotheosis worthy of <i>Rocky</i>. This is actually director Avildsen's first hit since <i>Rocky</i>, and it has the same mixture of calculation and apparent navet. It borrows its formula from both East and West with good humour, and is completely free of intelligence, discrimination and originality. No wonder it was a hit.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Where? Thats three monkeys, then, that this movie owes us. (Even
symbolically, these characters certainly hear, see and speak evil.)</p><p>A
lugubrious noir shot in a brackish tint, Ceylans latest has a
framework reminiscent of a tawdry James Cain novel but lacks the pitch
of urgency to get it off its dramatic duff. Dad (Bingol) is a driver
who takes the fall for his asleep-behind-the-wheel politico boss
involved in a vehicular manslaughter. A lump sum is promised on the
back end; in the interim, theres jail time, a wayward wife seeking
companionship (Aslan) and a layabout son (Sungar) whos flunked his
college-entrance exams and needs cash fast.</p><p>It all goes south in
a paternal postprison fury, and Ceylan, the pride of Turkeys art-house
cinema, plays every domestic browbeating for pure ponderousness. He
already has a stunner in his filmography, 2002s cohabitation satire <i>Distant</i>, yet theres a distinct sense that with his follow-up, <i>Climates</i>
(2006), and this one, Ceylan hasnt quite figured out his next move.
Vengeful plot machinations feel both tidy and fraught with unearned
significance; also, the occasional thunderclaps are a bit much. Calling
<i>Three Monkeys</i> a genre detour is putting it charitably; its a
downbeat dead end that reduces its talented maker to a mere shadow-play
stylist.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Parry is best known to Londoners as the director of dubious post-'Human Traffic' disco biscuit shouter 'SW9', but the memory of that youthful indiscretion deserves to be swept away by his latest. In 'Shooting Robert King', Parry follows the eponymous war photographer from a callow youth spent propping up the bar in the Sarajevo Holiday Inn, through some bleak, Pulitzer Prize-winning years in Moscow and Grozny, to a redemptive final act in Baghdad and Tennessee. King is a slippery subject  part self-absorbed fratboy, part tortured artist  but Parry's unerring focus and documentary discipline make him as fascinating as he is infuriating. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Long before he played Charles Foster Kane, Orson Welles blazed like
a sun in the theater world, and like a sun, he exerted enormous gravity
on those around him and often burned those who got too close. This
enjoyable light entertainment captures Welles ascendant, preparing for
his 1937 production of <i>Julius Caesar</i>. And like Welles himself, the actor playing him (McKay) makes it hard to notice there is anyone else around.</p><p>Efron
plays Richard, a New York high-school kid enamored of the theater who
cons his way into being cast as a last-minute replacement a week before
opening (the sole requirement is that he can play the ukulele; he
bluffs). And he gets a hard, fast education in theater and life. He
woos the companys resident unavailable hottie Sonja (Danes) and gets
his heart broken when he learns that shes not going to throw over her
career ambitions for a callow lad with adorable eyes. Ah, life upon the
wicked stage! Linklater delivers the story with clear-eyed efficiency,
and the period details are lovingly precise, but the film feels a bit
under-cooked.</p><p>Danes is perfectly satisfactory, and many of the
actors in secondary roles are quite good, but Efron isnt given much to
work with beyond fresh-faced up-and-at-em spirit, and hes not a
mature enough actor to find anything in the material. But McKay! He
doesnt just get the distinctive Welles cadence; he owns this film,
striding through scenes as if hes the lord of all he surveys. He is.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When astronaut Chuck Baker lands on Planet 51, hes shocked to discover its inhabited by green locust-like people who live in futuristic homes as envisaged by sci-fi writers of the 1950s. Fearing an invasion of post-Columbus proportions, the locals call on arrogant General Crawl to amass his anti-alien brigade. Only one character, a kid called Lom , is prepared to help Chuck evade capture. Planet 51 posits notions of colonialism, cultural division and xenophobia to unremarkable effect. Its also one hell of a magpie movie  thats to say it comes over as a mix of ideas, characters, designs and scenes that recall Shrek (hardly surprising given that the film is penned by Shrek writer Joe Stillman), The Cat in the Hat, Toy Story, Alien, Star Wars and ET. This below-par sci-fi animation is no threat to the similarly themed and infinitely superior Battle for Terra (released February 12), but theres enough of a storyline here to keep younger space cadets moderately settled.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An early encounter between Kurosawa and two of his favourite actors, Mifune and Shimura, both playing detectives in Japan's uneasy postwar period under US imperialism. When Mifune's pistol is stolen, he is overwhelmed by a feeling of dishonour rather than failure, and sets out on a descent into the lower depths of Tokyo's underworld, which gradually reveals Dostoievskian parallels between himself and his quarry. A sweltering summer is at its height, and Kurosawa's strenuous location shooting transforms the city into a sensuous collage of fluttering fans and delicate, sweating limbs. A fine blend of US thriller material with Japanese conventions, it's a small classic. CPea.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Kurosawa's adaptation of <i>Macbeth</i> is reckoned by many, Peter Brook among them, to be one of the very few successful efforts at filming Shakespeare. Translating the familiar story to medieval Japan, with Macbeth as the samurai Washizu (Mifune), the adaptation deletes most of the minor characters, transforms the witches' scenes into a magical encounter with an old woman spinning in a forest glade, perches 'Cobweb Castle' high in the hilly moorland where the clouds roll by like ground-fog, and conceives a stunningly graphic fate for the usurper, clinging stubbornly to his promise of glory even as he is being turned into a human pin-cushion by volleys of arrows. It's visually ravishing, as you would expect, employing compositional tableaux from the Noh drama, high contrast photography, and extraordinary images of rain, galloping horses, the birds fleeing from the forest; all of which contribute to the expression of a doom-laden universe whose only way out for its tragic hero is auto-destruction.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Banned in Senegal on an absurd technicality which is merely the tip of an iceberg of threats posed by a film which picks at the scab of many of Senegal's current sores. The story concerns an 18th century Senegalese village where the Christian and Islamic faiths are vying with each other and the older African traditions for adherents and power. The Ceddo ('outsiders') who do not wish to be converted take the desperate step of kidnapping the chief's daughter. Within this spare plot, Sembene raises issues of obvious pertinence to modern Senegal, such as the tension between spiritual and temporal power, Princess Dior's renunciation of her role of victim to take decisive action, and village leaders who are only too willing to betray their Africanness to maintain the status quo. Beneath the patina of universally comprehensible motifs lie peculiarly African symbols and meanings which will prove largely inaccessible to an English audience. Still, some of the homilies with which the film is riddled are universally pertinent: 'A man who wears trousers full of fat should not approach the fire'.]]></review>

This documentary chronicles the final year of their life together in a remote, hilly farmland whose splendor sharply contrasts with their humble peasant lifestyle. Its a punishing routine that Choi and his ox, their bodies both breaking down, wont relinquish, even as Lee urges their retirement. Her complaints may be incited by her hubbys uncommon affection toward the animal; theres even a shot of Choi brushing its hair as Lee glares at both.<br /></p><p>Thanks to <i>Old Partner</i>s nostalgic depiction of farm life, anthropomorphically charming lead animal and memorable HD scenery (which evokes traditional Korean painting), the films universal appeal is virtually ensured. But a conservative nationalist agenda can be detected in shots of a public demonstration against U.S.-imported beef and in the reverent depiction of a patriarch who insists on traditional farming practices, forgoing pesticides for fear of poisoning his ox. (If only he cared as much for his ailing wife!) At its best, the film adopts its subjects spartan demeanor, relying on wordless sequences that vividly depict the rhythms of farm labor; only director Lee Chung-ryouls awkward use of slo-mo and tinkling pianos betray any sense of sentimentality. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Scripted by Aaron Sorkin from his own play, considerably less interesting than <i>A Soldier's Story</i>, this centres on a fatal case of bullying in the US Marines and the ensuing trial. The intellectual cut-and-thrust of the courtroom is largely absent here, and the denouement seems slick, arbitrary, and derived from the Captain Queeg catalogue. Even worse, Cruise is cast as the dilettante Navy lawyer with a brilliant legal brain, and jives about in much the same manner as he did in <i>Top Gun</i>. Lieutenant Commander Demi Moore wants him to get serious, praises his brain repeatedly in case we missed it, and finally gets him shouting idealistically in court. The pair of them are useless in uniform, and shown up by the highly professional Bacon, who gives a layered performance as the opposing counsel. Unfortunately, the most interesting character is little more than a cameo for Nicholson, but he does give an alarming sketch of the litist military mind.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ray Harryhausen's first Dynamation effort in Arabian Nights territory. His knockout special effects include a cyclops, dragon, and duelling skeleton (forerunner of the battling skeletons sequence in<i> Jason and the Argonauts</i>), all expertly and realistically manipulated, employing techniques learned and developed from his mentor, the late, great Willis H <i>King Kong</i> O'Brien. Torin Thatcher's evil magician (a part he repeated for the less enthralling <i>Jack the Giant Killer</i>, also for Juran, three years later) more than compensates for Kerwin Mathews' rather wet Sinbad, while Bernard Herrmann's typically effective score tops off the whole adventure.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Why did the fans turn late-nite screenings of this cult favourite into an elaborate ritual of dressing-up, singing along, throwing rice and waving cigarette lighters? Well, for one thing, the material inspires affection, given its knowing pastiche of everything from Universal horrors to '50s grade-Z sci-fi, and a shamelessly hedonistic, fiercely independent sensibility that must have seemed a welcome relief from the mainstream bombast of other '70s musicals (not exactly <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i>, is it?). However, dare we suggest that the whole participation angle evolved to boost a movie that is something of an enthusiastic shambles, and collapses altogether in the final reel? Fresh-faced Sarandon and Bostwick are the all-American honeymooners who wind up in the tender care of Tim Curry's camper-than-thou Transylvanian transvestite, O'Brien's hunchback butler and sundry kinky cronies. A string of hummable songs gives it momentum, Gray's admirably straight-faced narrator holds it together, and a run on black lingerie takes care of almost everything else.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This pathetic attempt at comic horror (deriving from an initial project to rework <i>Peter Pan</i> in vampiric terms) not only plays fast and loose with vampire mythology but also fails to deliver either frights or laughs. Soon after moving to the coastal town of Santa Clara with his mother (Wiest) and elder brother Michael (Patric), young MTV addict Sam (Haim) is warned against vampires by the two Goonies who run the local comic shop. Lured to a wild cave party, Michael gets his first taste of blood (out of a bottle?). Forewarned is forearmed, however, and when Michael starts wearing shades, sleeping all day and flying around, Sam and the comic kids reach for the holy water, garlic and wooden stakes. Directed with a cavalier disregard for intelligibility, this has to be one of the most anaemic vampire flicks ever made.]]></review>

Neither stooping to cheap emotional manipulation nor pussyfooting around candid questions about sex, spirituality and the definition of <i>normal, </i>the filmmakers irreverent directness with his subjects makes for a savagely funny and bluntly insightful portrait of those who live with disfigurement.

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Wed like to hope that it wasnt the money that made writer Jason Segel and director Nicholas Stoller feel that wacky rocker Aldous Snow from <i>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</i>
deserved his own spin-off. Hes certainly amusing in small doses. As
vividly realized by Russell Brand, Snow is an unholy mixture of stupidity,
vanity, self-importance, addictive personality and weird charisma.
Throw Hill into the mix as an ambitious record-company flunky sent to
chaperone Snow from London to a gig at L.A.s Greek Theater and youve
got drunkenness, time spent in Vegas and some extra-raunchy sex jokes.
Wasnt that <i>The Hangover</i>? Eh, shut up and laugh, you ticket-buying meatbags.</p><p>The
script has some really funny shit in it. Segels particularly good at
extended crazy riffs (though some of that may be coming from Brand,
whos got a pretty healthy rsum of crazy riffs). So why isnt this
movie funnier? Why are we checking our watches around the 80-minute
mark? Partly, its because Stollers direction is flatter than day-old
Champagne left over from a night of hotel-suite destruction. And when
the filmmakers try for real heart in the last third, the whole thing
deflates. If youre going to be rock &amp; roll, you cant get all
mushy about fatherhood and relationships and shit.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A superb Western, exemplifying Mann's capacity for integrating his interest in spectacle with a resonant narrative fully deserving the adjective 'classic', in which Gary Cooper's ex-outlaw is under constant, ranting pressure from Cobb's gang-leader father-figure to return to the fold. The odyssey of Cooper (playing the emblematically named Link Jones) from pasture to desert to ghost town and back, and from settled present to tormented past and back, bridges the traditions of classical tragedy and classic Hollywood. Mann's synthesis of archetypal characters and generic iconography is seamless; and he manages to inscribe landscape, anxious voyeurism and fratricide within his narrative resolution. Textbook cinema, maybe, but Mann's work will remain rich for discovery and celebration.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Soul-stirring celebration or crass cultural exploitation? Truth is, The Blues Brothers is a bit of both, lending exposure to rhythm and blues legends  who might otherwise have faded into silence while at the same time treating black culture as a colourful pantomime backdrop for the antics of two white comedians. That Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi adore this music is not in question  its lovingly chosen and brilliantly performed  but the film sometimes feels like a work of cultural tourism, particularly in scenes set in a gospel church and a Chicago street market. These lively musical sequences also sit awkwardly with director John Landiss bizarre predilection for wholesale destruction: sure, smashing up cop cars can be fun, but Landis takes things to a tiresome extreme. Still, the film retains a huge nostalgic kick, thanks in large part to Aykroyd and Belushis easy rapport, a smattering of daft, shaggy humour  and some truly iconic musical sequences.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Anderson's second feature - a dazzling, highly confident, atmospherically original and refreshingly non-prurient take on the LA porn movie community - may not be a '90s <i>Citizen Kane</i>, as some claim, but in terms of sweep, ambition and precocious cinematic competence, it heralds the arrival of a new talent. Charting the rise and fall of well-endowed teenage ingnu Dirk Diggler (Wahlberg), from dishwasher to subcultural skinflick superstar, and back to washed-out junkie, the film is less a cautionary tale than a freewheeling, talent-showcasing homage to the glitter, tack and kitsch excesses of the drug-fuelled late '70s and the hangover '80s. The sense of homage/pastiche goes further still: if the rambling ensemble construction derives from <i>Nashville</i>, the swooping long takes and whiplash pans come courtesy of Scorsese. But it's the music that calls the tune with the energetic soul and disco records of the period dictating the editing, pacing and the slightly sleazy, morally neutral tone. This is style condescending magnificently to content, but what stiffens this unashamedly exhibitionist movie's muscles are the 'family' of beautifully judged performances, from Reynolds' stand-out as porn-king auteur/father figure, to Moore's superb cokehead survivor-star and Macy's humiliated cuckold, right down to Hoffman's gut-wrenching gay crew member.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Earth's in peril, yet again, and the US President must call the shots. This time, though, we're rooting for the space invaders. Tim Burton's film is the most subversive big-budget Hollywood production in years, a splenetic satire which gleefully trashes contemporary culture - politics, science and religion, the army, TV, food, music, even money. Unfortunately, it's not very good. The tacky design undoubtedly cost a fortune, and there's a real perversity in casting superstars to ham it up in homage to Ed Wood. The anarchy is sometimes inspired (Burton incinerates Congress, movie stars and doves with equal abandon - he loves playing Godzilla), but much of the film is flat and cripplingly indulgent. It feels nearly half an hour too long, and Nicholson, in a double role, is just too much. It's a personal work, but not a mature one. It didn't hit home at the US box-office, but the reviews have been surprisingly accommodating. In that sense, this sour, prefabricated cult movie has the last laugh - and I'm afraid the joke's on us.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[These were the days when Allen was still a comedian who happened to make films, rather than the comic film-maker he became. (Don't believe it? Then read film editor Ralph Rosenblum's account of the film's chaotic creation in the cutting-room, in his book <i>When the Shooting Stops</i>). The movie is therefore little more than a series of shrewd but disjointed anecdotes dealing with Allen's usual self-obsessive hang-ups and fashionable metropolitan pastimes: existential dread, masturbation, coke-sniffing, movie-going, psychoanalysis, etc. The one-liners are razor-sharp, the observations of Manhattanite manners as keen as mustard, and some of the romantic stuff even quite touching. If you can forgive the fact that it's a ragbag of half-digested intellectual ideas dressed up with trendy intellectual references, you should have a good laugh.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Although nominally based on journalist Cameron Crowe's investigative study of high school kids, this is essentially a straight sex'n'fun exploitation movie. There's the usual array of school stereotypes (the lecher, the stoned surfer, the hustler), a rock score, and endless attention to the rituals of dating and mating. Taken purely on this level, it's a relatively witty example of its kind, with an enjoyable performance from Penn as the stoned surfer, and some good lines. But it lacks the frenzied energy which allowed <i>Porky's</i> to beat all competitors in its field.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The term <i>Italian neorealism</i> has become so firmly tied to
this film that its hard to view it on its merits. Stripped of all that
weightthe films it influenced, the historically important images of
bombed-out Rome, the supposed way it rejects artifice in favor of an
honest portrayal of poverty<i>Bicycle Thieves</i> remains
beautiful and moving. De Sica carefully balances a generally tragic
sensibility with a quiet undercurrent of hope, all the while sucking us
into the story with the sheer urgency of the search for a stolen
bicycle.</p><p>Antonio (Maggiorani) needs that bicycle for his new job
putting up advertising posters. So when its stolen on his very first
day, hes ready to go anywhere, do anything to get it back. Weve
learned just how precarious the family finances are; to get the bike
out of hock, Antonios wife, Maria, has had to pawn their bedsheets.
Its a measure of just how bad the postwar situation is in Rome that
their sheets are stored on shelves bulging with personal belongings.
The whole city is in hock. </p><p>Watching the film for perhaps the
20th time, we were struck again by the great performance of 8-year-old
Staiola as Antonios son and conscience, Bruno. Watch this kid give the
movie its throbbing emotional heart with the way he looks at his
father, mixing admiration and consternation as things go from bad to
worse.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA['Oh Lord', says the preacher in a suitably grave voice, 'do we have the strength to carry out this task in one night, or are we just jerking off?' Maybe Mel Brooks should have asked himself that question about this movie. The screenplay is credited to five writers, and it shows in the confused melange of styles. There are some lovely touches, and a score of lines like the preacher's which start pompous and end crude; or the contrast between picture - archetypal white-haired old lady - and words - 'Up yours, Nigger!' But if part is delightful, a larger part proves that there is more corn in Hollywood than Oklahoma, and a lot is just Hollywood jerking off.]]></review>

The mystery is merely conventional, but it's alternated with superbly staged musical sequences, spectacular but respecting the proscenium's limits and notable for their cheekily bizarre nature (scantily clad girls in suggestive routines, with the murder discovered when blood drips on to a posing chorine's bare shoulder during a rendition of 'Sweet Marijuana'). Duke Ellington makes a welcome appearance, and Leisen handles the whole thing with witty, typically lavish style.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Animal as saint: Bresson's stark, enigmatic parable, a donkey (named after one of the Three Wise Men) is both a witness to and the victim of mankind's cruelty, stupidity - and love. Taking his lack of faith in theatrical acting to its logical limit, Bresson perversely places the mute beast centre-screen as he passes from owner to owner, giving rides, heaving agricultural machinery, and receiving beatings and caresses in a coolly observed landscape of poverty and folly. The effect could not be more different from that of other films (Disney's say, or <i>Jaws</i>) that centre around animals; Balthazar's death during a smuggling expedition, amidst a field of sheep, is both lyrical and entirely devoid of maudlin sentiment. Imbued with a dry, ironic sense of humour, the film is perhaps the director's most perfectly realised, and certainly his most moving.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In a market crowded with CGI-laden animations, this 2D family feature certainly stands out. It is, quite literally, an echo of a bygone era, based on the childrens books that Margret and HA Rey launched in the 1940s. A mischievous prankster, chimpanzee George is lifted out of his lonely existence in the African jungle when mild-mannered explorer Ted (voiced by Will Ferrell) comes looking for a famed giant idol to save the fortunes of his beloved museum in New York. Complications ensue when the idol Ted returns with is tiny, and Georges presence in New York does little to help  initially, at least. The plots slightly dull, but George provides light entertainment for young kids eager to live out their fantasies (flying over the city hanging on to balloons, etc). This, along with a catchy soundtrack from Jack Johnson, should endear parents to Curious George: its good old-fashioned family entertainment. The fact that it only pays lip service to the knowing humour typical of the Ice Age and Shrek franchises may or may not detract from its appeal.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>You could sum up the arc of this drama from Iranian director Majid Majidi (<i>The Color of Paradise</i>) thusly: A man (Naji) loses his job. He then becomes a driver in order to support his family. Its a basic narrative, but like the art-house imports that came out of the Middle Eastern country in the fertile 90s, <i>The Song of Sparrows</i> possesses a deceptive simplicity. The film could serve as a regional-cinema primer: Staples such as landscapes heavily freighted with metaphor and precocious kidshere in the form of the heros son (Aghazi) and his buddiesshow up in bulk. And like its predecessors, the films neorealistic style emphasizes both the rough beauty of rural terrain and Tehrans urban chaos. </p><p>Yet pinpointing <i>Sparrows</i> nods to yesterdays New Wave doesnt nearly do justice to the lyricism that is the directors stock-in-trade. Words can describe a handful of momentsa blue door carried on a mans back, an ostrich doing a Saint Vitus dance, goldfish flopping on a pale concrete walkwaybut reductive statements dont replicate the impact or vitality of the images. Its Majidis impeccable eye that lifts the movies everyday-people parable above the norm; wedded to such visual poetry, even its minor tragedies and smaller victories seem positively profound.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Forget about the facts, common sense or good taste for a moment. Consider the circumstances, befitting a comedy, of <i>Pirate Radio.</i> Evidently, there was once a powerful segment of mid-60s Britain that happened to be utterly tone-deaf. How else to explain these ministers inability to hearor<i> feel</i>a strutting riff like the Kinks All Day and All of the Night? Rock music, while explosively popular, had limited exposure on official radio, leading to the operation of offshore broadcasters (that is, until the government shut them down in 1967). Who can truly say if such rollicking seaborne vessels included the likes of suavely dignified Quentin (Nighy, a dotty delight), DJs like the Count (Hoffman) or Kiwi garage-nugget purist Angus (<i>The Flight of the Conchords</i> Rhys Darby)? Thats poetic license for you.</p><p>Painted broadly and genially by writer-director Richard Curtis (<i>Love Actually</i>), <i>Pirate Radio </i>hasnt got any real anger to vent. Instead, it goes to extra lengths to give its sour villains an almost Dickensian comic menace. (Thats what you get when you cast Kenneth Branagh.) The bobbing,self-contained universe, occasionally visited by groupies, often feels like a more relaxed deck of Wes Andersons ship in <i>The Life Aquatic</i>; while the main plot thrust is the maturation of young Carl (Sturridge) among the lovable crazies, we mostly wander around the boats interiors, oohing and aahing at gorgeous period decor. Giggles, not belly laughs, come frequently, and itll help if viewers love U.K. comics. When an inevitable <i>Titanic</i>-like finale arrives, one neednt worry if these vivid charactersor rock &amp; rollwill ever die.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Despite a loss of temperature through the flashbacks which let in some female interest, this is one of Dassin's best films. Less coherent than Siegel's <i>Riot in Cell Block 11</i> in its challenge to prison conditions, it draws on WWII experience to draw a powerful analogy between the prison (where Cronyn's sadistic chief guard beats up prisoners to the strains of Wagner) and a fascist state. With brutality breeding brutality in this world which the dialogue (script by Richard Brooks) defines as an existentialist hell from which there is no escape, <i>Brute Force</i> was a notably violent film in its day. The scene in which an informer is herded by blow-torches to execution in a steam press still chills.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Kurosawa's masterpiece, testifying to his admiration for John Ford and translated effortlessly back into the form of a Western as <i>The Magnificent Seven</i>, has six masterless samurai - plus Mifune, the crazy farmer's boy not qualified to join the elect group, who nevertheless follows like a dog and fights like a lion - agreeing for no pay, just food and the joy of fulfilling their duty as fighters, to protect a helpless village against a ferocious gang of bandits. Despite the caricatured acting forms of Noh and Kabuki which Kurosawa adopted in his period films, the individual characterisations are precise and memorable, none more so than that by Takashi Shimura, one of the director's favourite actors, playing the sage, ageing, and oddly charismatic samurai leader. The epic action scenes involving cavalry and samurai are still without peer.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In the pleasingly rambling garden of a country house north of Paris, lecturer Frdric (Charles Berling), New York-based designer Adrienne (Juliette Binoche) and Jrmie (Jrmie Renier), who toils profitably for a French sportswear company in Beijing, are gathered with partners and kids for a lunch to celebrate the seventy-fifth birthday of their widowed mother Hlne (Edith Scob). Shes the proudly independent and protective keeper of the flame  and the valuable collected belongings  of her late uncle, a well-known artist, so when, months later, Hlne herself dies, the three siblings come together once more to decide what to do with the house, its coveted contents, and Hlnes faithful housekeeper Eloise<br />Assayass most fully satisfying film for some while, this is a warm, wise drama about the tensions and mysteries of family life. With a seemingly loose but meticulously assembled narrative in the style of his earlier ensemble piece Late August, Early September, it chronicles the interactions between the various characters with psychological subtlety and precision, even as it explores the changing roles played by art, property, work and blood-ties in an increasingly globalised world. <br />While never ignoring the grief death causes, Assayas refuses to sentimentalise; <br />its a film of deft, delicate nuances, particularly alert to the fact that everyone has not only his/her reasons but also, inevitably, secrets that will be borne to the grave. Perhaps the characters are finally a little too uniformly decent, but it would be churlish to bemoan the generosity of spirit in a film so beautifully performed, intelligently written and fluently directed. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The real progenitor of this musical celebrating the rock'n'roll '50s, had it not fudged some of the less adequate dance numbers by shooting above the knees, would be <i>West Side Story</i>. Otherwise, the film aspires to some of the pretensions of <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i>, from which it borrows liberally while saddled with the liabilities of its dumb stage musical script. Its flashy opportunism (nostalgia pitched squarely at an audience too young to even recall the era) quickly becomes very irritating. Allusions to french letters and high school pregnancies, and double entendres allowed by the hindsight of this more 'permissive' society, scarcely conceal the fact that <i>Grease</i> is even more simplistic (and finally reactionary) than the beach blanket movies of the era. Lots of colour, movement, surface glitter, only one decent song (the title track sung by Frankie Valli).]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Axelrod's patchy but often brilliant first attempt at direction: a kooky fantasy, very funny in its satire of contemporary teen morals and mores. McDowall plays a high school student of enormous IQ and fabulous powers, which he exercises in order to grant a pretty co-ed (Weld) her every heart's desire, starting with the thirteen cashmere sweaters she requires to join an exclusive sorority, and ending with a husband whom he obligingly murders to leave her free to realise her true dream of movie stardom. Whereupon, realising he did it all for love, he ends up in the booby-hatch, happily dictating his memoirs. Taking in some delicious side-swipes at the 'Beach Blanket' cycle, Axelrod reveals much the same penchant (and talent) for cartoon-style sight gags as Tashlin, and coaxes a marvellous trio of variations on the American female from Tuesday Weld, Lola Albright and Ruth Gordon. Daniel Fapp's stunningly cool, clear monochrome camerawork is also a distinct plus.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Movies about moviemakinglike Minnellis <i>The Bad and the Beautiful</i> or Altmans <i>The Player</i>often
center on intrigue, the producer characters being one part mogul to
four parts Machiavelli. Behind-the-scenes theatrics are muted in
Hansen-Lves quietly absorbing character study of Grgoire Canvel
(Louis-Do de Lencquesaing), a Parisian independent film producer so
calmly adroit at shepherding talent that his slide into bankruptcy
seems a mere detail amid the long workdays he spends at the office, on
sets and via mobile phone.</p><p>Although portents of collapse (hes
busted for speeding) gradually surface, the moment mid-film when
Grgoire enters a deserted street to shoot himself is both shocking and
oddly quotidian. Hansen-Lve, a former actress (<i>Late August, Early September</i>,
directed by her companion Olivier Assayas), was inspired by her
association with another mentor: Humbert Balsan, a gifted, urbane
producer who championed such diverse artists as Lars von Trier, Claire
Denis, James Ivory and Bla Tarr (<i>The Man from London</i> was the last project Balsan oversaw before he hanged himself in 2005).</p><p>After
Grgoires death, the focus shifts to his wife Sylvia (Caselli), who
tries to salvage his company while monitoring their three daughters.
The eldest, Clmence (Alice de Lencquesaing of <i>Summer Hours</i>),
uncovers a mystery hidden in old letters. Her attempts to solve it end
rather like Dads life: a tantalizing fragment of a work in progress,
to be teased out by future generations.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Give James Ivory a long-lauded novel (<i>A Room with a View</i>, <i>The Bostonians</i>)or a decent book by a great author (<i>Howards End</i>)and
he can deliver an adaptation attuned to period-piece nuances and
intricate social codes. Hand this filmmaker a piece of fiction set in
the here and now, however, and Ivory seems lost; its as if he needs
decades of distance and a canonized voice to bring out his best work.
So its no surprise that, even with longtime screenwriter Ruth Prawer
Jhabvala watching his back, the director never finds his groove with
Peter Camerons tale about an academic (Omar Metwally) who encounters
problems while writing a biography of a late literary celebrity. The
loved ones wont consent; after this would-be Boswell treks down to the
family compound in Uruguay, he gets caught up in the lives of the
authors wife (Laura Linney), mistress (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and brother (Anthony Hopkins).</p><p>The
impeccably photographed landscapes and highbrow talk of the filmmakers
tony dramas are here. (You probably just read criticism, barks
Hopkins, the Ivory equivalent of an Oh, snap!) But the emotional pull
of his classic screen translations is completely MIA, and not even
Linney and Hopkins engaging in a thespian-off livens things up.
Finality, schminality; its like being stuck in a remote way station,
awaiting better things.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ill come clean  this stoner comedy is one of the funniest films Ive
seen since Theres Something About Mary. Harold (John Cho) is an
efficient Korean-born finance rep whos often left to pick up the
pieces of his xenophobic, work-shy colleagues; his best mate, Kumar
(Kal Penn), a promising Indian medical student constantly ribbed by the
local dunderhead gang, is supposed to be readying himself for a series
of career interviews but, quite frankly, hed rather just get stoned.
And what pleases Kumar pleases Harold. During a toking session, the
pair spy a TV ad for a well-known US fast-food joint that spurs them
into an overnight burger quest that proceeds to spiral ridiculously,
and hilariously, out of control. The film comes with at least
half-a-dozen side-splitting scenes, yet behind all the Farrelly-esque
gross-out humour and Cheech &amp; Chong-isms lies a sensitive little
picture with a deftly handled anti-racism slant. Credit too to the
congenial leads (especially Penn), who have their indomitable
characters down to a T.]]></review>

With unidentifiable urban and rural locations (a.k.a. Canada), moments

comeuppance plot, its like a flashback to early David Cronenberg,
only done by a lesser director who doesnt quite know how to pull off
the creepy effects hes striving for.</p><p>As husband-and-wife
geneticists Clive and Elsa, Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley seem equally unsure what
to do with their roles. Theyve been creating new creatures using
manipulated animal DNA in hopes of harvesting miracle drugs. When a big
show-and-tell for the stockholders goes horribly awry, it looks as if
theyll lose funding. Elsa, a modern-day Eve luring Clive into
temptation, persuades him to continue their experiments in secret using
human DNA. What could go wrong?</p><p>The resulting creature, Dren (Abigail Chu and later Delphine Chanac), matures and learns at an alarming rate, and pretty soon its like <i>The Day of the Dolphin</i> crossed with <i>Its Alive</i>,
only with a twisted sexual vibe. And, as this relies more and more
heavily on conventional horror moves, everyone is forced to act like
the dumb slasher-movie teenagers who wander into the woods to have sex.
There are some really creepy moments, but director Vincenzo Natali doesnt push the
perversity hard enough to take it into the deep twistedness that
Cronenberg exploits so effectively.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An iconic movie of the '80s, with all the unappealing baggage that suggests. Five mutually antipathetic teens are called in for Saturday detention at a suburban American high school. Initial bouts of verbal jousting fade, making way for a bonding session fugged in pot smoke, the development of friendship everlasting (or until bell rings for class on Monday morning, whichever is the sooner) and That Simple Minds Song. Which would be fine, were the characters not a punchable quintet of overdrawn saps, the acting (Ringwald and Hall excepted) overplayed and unsympathetic, and the script the wrong side of the line that separates smart from smart-arse. Its continuing cult popularity is mystifying; as teen movies go, this is a long way off, say, <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i> or <i>Pretty in Pink</i>. Hughes: stay behind for detention afterwards. And write me four sides on why this, uh, sucks.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[After <i>Planes, Trains and Automobiles</i>, writer/producer John Hughes turns once more to the nightmare of travel, this time from a child's perspective. Set to spend Christmas in Paris with parents and assorted relatives, young Kevin (Culkin) wishes everyone would just disappear, a desire granted when he is accidentally left behind by his preoccupied parents (Heard and O'Hara). But the novelty starts to wear off when a couple of burglars (Stern and Pesci, excellent) target the house. Hughes confidently mixes elements of precocious self-awareness with childlike wonderment: the boy truly believes his dream has become manifest, so he gorges on junk food and television until the reality of the situation brings loneliness and fear. Broader in humour, however, with an inconsistency of mood not helped by abrupt editing and Columbus' sometimes self-conscious direction, <i>Home Alone</i> lacks the sustained tension of the earlier film.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This routine sequel has a trio of nice cameos, but no surprises. Through mix-ups, Kevin (Culkin) gets detached from the family again, and while they fly on holiday to Florida, he fetches up alone in New York. Bad burglars Harry (Pesci) and Marv (Stern) turn up again to rob a toyshop of its Christmas takings, which owner Mr Duncan (Bracken) has earmarked for a children's hospital. Wandering about Central Park, Kevin encounters a sinister-seeming but actually lonely pigeon lady (Fricker), and advises her about love and life (much as he did the sinister-seeming but lonely snow-shoveller in the earlier film). His sojourn at the Plaza Hotel is fraught with suspicious staff (Curry), but his battle with the burglars - surely the point of these flicks - mistakes the pain threshold for hilarity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hollywood's chutzpah whizzkids Spielberg and Lucas team up to bring the audiences who flocked to <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Close Encounters</i> a replay of the innocent pleasures of Saturday serials, but done at two hours length with a much larger budget than the old cliffhangers could command. Spielberg's evasion of present day realities in an effort to recapture the sheer childlike fun of moviegoing is as perverse as was his previous film, <i>1941</i>. What he offers is one long, breathtaking chase of a plot as his pre-World War II superhero, outsize and Bogartian, races to prevent the omnipotent Ark of the Covenant from falling into the hands of Hitler's Nazis. Whether you swallow it or not, see it for a handful of totally unexpected visual jokes, worth the price of admission alone.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA['I coulda been a contender, Charlie': Brando's classic lament in <i>On the Waterfront </i>finds a new and vigorous echo in this low-budget film whose huge success, against all odds, mirrors its own theme. <i>Rocky</i> is an old-fashioned fairytale brilliantly revamped to chime in with the depressed mood of the '70s. Although its plot - nonentity gets to fight the heavyweight champ - is basically fantasy, the film deftly manages to suspend disbelief by drawing back at its more implausible moments. Despite a few clumsy early scenes, the dialogue hits some bull's-eyes ('I'm really a ham-and-egger' mumbles Stallone in disbelief when he hears he'll get a crack at the champ), and Burgess Meredith gives his best performance in years as a slobbering, aged trainer. But without its climax, <i>Rocky</i> would add up to very little: the big fight is cathartic, manipulative Hollywood at its best. In a word: emotion.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Lean's 1962 epic dwarfed most of the contemporary competition, including <i>Spartacus</i> and <i>El Cid</i>, and the passage of time has only proved how difficult it is to run ideas, history, characterisation and landscape in harness on this sort of scale. In the restored 'director's cut' (adding a further six minutes), certain mysteries are cleared up. TE Lawrence's berserk massacre of Turkish soldiers is no longer motiveless, but a reprisal for the killing of Arab children; he knew his way about in the desert because he was a cartographer. The two sequences that everybody remembers are still cinematically daring, and both reverberate in the imagination like a gong: Sheik Ali's slow emergence from desert haze into focus to shoot a trespasser at his water-hole, and the cut from a burning match to the rising sun. The storming of Aqaba on the Red Sea, shot from a far vantage point, is as exhilarating as Derby Day, and in clean contrast to the brutal sweaty massacres elsewhere. Despite the extra footage, the united Arab attempts at government in Damascus are still too condensed to communicate, though the pandemonium of revolutionary fervour at the conference eclipses similar stuff in, say, <i>Reds</i> or <i>Danton</i>. As for O'Toole's Lawrence, he is an extraordinary mixture of narcissist, mystic and masochist, a Nietzschean with whimpering crises of confidence, half Man of Destiny, half borne under by the tides of nationalism.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One can see why this was the first Iranian title to be Oscar-nominated for Best Foreign Film. The story of two children and a pair of lost shoes leans heavily on plaintive looks and big brown eyes. In a Teheran greengrocer's, a blind rag-and-bone man accidentally makes off with the trainers that nine-year-old Ali has left unattended. The shoes belong to the boy's sister, but when Ali gets home the children agree not to mention the loss to their hard-up dad. Instead, they take it in turns to wear Ali's shoes, an arrangement destined to cause complications. All this promises the sort of junior-quest narrative familiar from Kiarostami's classic <i>Where Is My Friend's House?</i>, but the task of recovering the trainers becomes secondary to the notion of weighing material possessions against spiritual worth. The film's storytelling is appealing, but you can't help feeling that the adults are too good to be true, the onrush of tears rather conveniently deployed to ease potential crises.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Alonso's first film was <i>La Libertad</i> (<i>Freedom</i>), and that name might apply equally well to his second, a minimalist road movie with exotic scenery. Vargas, who is in every scene bar the opening sequence, is released after serving a prison sentence for murder. He journeys back home into the jungle to rejoin his family. As far as plot goes, that's it - and while the writer/director doubtless has big themes in mind, you pretty much have to take these on trust. For most of the second half we watch Vargas paddling upstream in a canoe. At least he has an interesting face. If you let yourself slip into its verdant glide, the film does have a seductive, immersive quality, but then there's a pretentiously ambiguous non-ending to cope with, followed by a heavy blast of techno over the credits, the first music we've heard in 78 minutes.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[As a cynical exercise in franchise exploitation this live-action/animated feature takes some beating; as a lm, its target audience appears to be child fans of the cartoon characters' live-action co-star, basketball player Michael Jordan. Realising he doesn't get a penny from the spin-off toys owned by Jordan's kids, Bugs Bunny considers getting a better agent. To revive his ailing Moron Mountain theme park, Swackhammer dispatches his minions, the Nerdlucks, to Looney Tunes Land, to kidnap Bugs, Daffy Duck, Wile E Coyote, et al. To save their skins, the Looney Tunes challenge their would-be abductors to a game of basketball, whereupon the Nerdlucks transform themselves into their fearsome alter egos, the Monstars, before siphoning off the ball-playing skills from a bunch of NBA stars. To even up the odds, Bugs and Co kidnap Jordan and beg him to lick them into shape for the big game. The set plays are transparently simple, the execution sloppy and the ending signposted days in advance. Visually, it's a mess: the attempts to blend 2- and 3-D animation with live-action and computer-generated images produce scenes that are fuzzier than the storyline.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[I predicted in a review of The Bounty Hunter that, while that was bad, there would be worse in 2010. Well, make way for Number One. Although the two films are similar  both are built on marital strife, knockabout violence and shouting  Bounty Hunter at least had the comic charisma of Jennifer Aniston to paper over the cracks. With Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher in the leads, charm is not an option.<br />Its a shame, because theres a half-decent premise to Killers. Kutcher plays Spencer, a CIA hitman who turns in his gun when he falls for Heigls meek daddys girl. So it comes as a surprise to her when, three years into their marriage, it turns out all their suburban neighbours are also hired killers, paid to keep Spencer in line. Director Robert Luketics grasp of action is almost as ham-fisted as his understanding of character, and Kutcher and Heigl are unable to bring any warmth to what is at heart a bitter, cynical script. Just awful.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Its simply not true that everybody talks about the weather but no
one does anything about it: Humans have been trying to get their hands
on the planetary thermostat since they dropped down from the trees. And
as this breezy doc by Robert Greene (<i>All In: The Poker Movie</i>)
demonstrates, questions of how, why and whether we can thus take charge
have lately become a lot more urgent with the realization that we are
already committed to an ad-hoc experiment in planetary climate
modification thanks to a century and change of petroleum-based mass
production.</p><p>The film canvasses a spectrum of existing and
proposed technologies for tweaking global temperatures and
precipitation patterns ranging from the familiar (seeding rain clouds
with silver iodide crystals) to the James Bondian (interposing millions
of tiny reflectors between us and the sun), then lets proponents and
critics hash out the political and environmental implications. Greene
manages to convey the momentousness of the stakes without hitting that
heart-sinking enviro-bummer button built into so many well-intended
ecological docs.</p><p>Unfortunately, the film is also haphazardly
organized and frustratingly repetitive. Its also disappointingly light
on both hard science and history: I came away confused as to whether
the cloud-seeding thing really works, and I was staggered that Greene
couldnt find room for at least a mention of dear, crazy old Wilhelm
Reich, the renegade Freudian who used to make it rain by draining
invisible deadly orgone energy from the sky with his amazing
cloudbuster machine.</p>]]></review>

Writers-block-plagued author Richard (Jeff Daniels, somehow both sour and

here), one of those preternaturally world-wise teen girls who inhabit
indie films, giving film critics a chance to gush about breakthrough

      <review><![CDATA[<p>For more than four decades, Romero has used the tropes of the zombie movie to reflect on American society: As many have noted, <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> allegorized the social tensions of the 60s, <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> embodied Me Decade consumerism, <i>Day of the Dead</i> found its horrors in a hyper-Reaganite world without government, and <i>Land of the Dead</i> and <i>Diary of the Dead</i>, in their own ways, reflected on the Iraq War. But <i>Survival of the Dead</i>
is the first living-dead installment that feels as if it was made
on-demand, without a compelling target. Romero seems invested in
finding new weapons for zombie killsflare gun, barbecue forkbut
although he takes on the (for him) marginal challenge of making a
zombie Western, he seems uninterested in the actors, the hideous
digital videography or the story.</p><p><i>Survival</i> mostly takes
place on an island off the coast of Delaware where for some reason
everyone speaks with an overwrought Irish brogue. Theres a feud
between the OFlynns and the Muldoons, ysee, who argue over whether to
kill their zombie friends or keep them alive in chains as reminders of
the past. Our stake in this debate is minimal, which may be the point.
At the movies Toronto premiere last year, a programmer suggested that
the two clans were meant to represent Republicans and Democrats. Romero
felt his message was broader, and that it was basically a movie about
war. What zombie picture isnt? This series shouldnt end with such a
putrefying corpse.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The Wilco doc <i>I Am Trying to Break Your Heart</i> captured the band in a particularly rough patch, fighting with its label while recording the album <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i>.
Rather than compete with that films artistic black-and-white and deep
look at backstage intrigue, directors Brendan Canty and Christoph Green have opted to present a
concert film. Not satisfied with capturing one night on stage, theyve
culled great performances of a variety of songs from a whole tour and
created their own set list. Its a bit jarring when two songs in a row
early in the film are the final numbers of different concerts, but
youll get over it. The little time spent trying to characterize the
band members is frankly wasted; this film is at its best when the band
is on stage. Wilco fans will love it, but those looking for more
insight should seek out <i>I Am Trying to Break Your Heart</i>.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Kurosawa's first venture for his own short-lived production company, a revenge tragedy (employee of big housing corporation marries the boss' daughter while simultaneously seeking the truth of his father's 'suicide') which attempts to indict the corruptions that go hand-in-hand with big business, ultimately hinting that even the government cannot be said to have clean hands. Freed from immediate box-office pressures, Kurosawa rather loaded the film on the side of social significance, while neglecting to capitalise on the <i>noir </i>aspects that underlie it. Even so, his use of the 'scope screen is masterly, suggesting right from the opening sequence - a wedding at which the cake is a replica of the company offices, and the crippled bride has obviously had a groom bought from among daddy's employees - a boardroom table across which manipulations gradually unfold. Exported in a 135-minute version.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Critters who by all rights should be wild enjoy lives of luxury among
humans until they are thrown back into nature. Quick, is that Madagascar, The Wild or Open Season?
Do the people behind the computer-animation glut have no original
ideas? Honestly, though, this is among the less annoying animated films
to choke the theaters of late.

          
		  



Boog (Lawrence) is a grizzly bear who has been raised by
well-meaning ranger Beth (Messing) in a mountain town. He sleeps in her
garage, owns a teddy bear and uses the toilet. But when wisecracking
mule deer Elliot (Kutcher) lures Boog into trashing a convenience store
in search of chocolate, Beth goes all Born Free
on Boogs ass, dropping him (and Elliot) far from town so he can revert
to nature. Boog just wants to get home. Elliot just wants to have fun.
And a crazed hunter (Sinise) just wants to kill anything and everything
with four legs.




The whole film feels like the road-company production of a better film. 
The voice talents are adequate but not great, Paul Westerbergs songs on 
the soundtrack are heartfelt but not memorable, and the animation is 
okay. Thats not exactly a ringing endorsement, but an indifferent shrug is about all we could muster.]]></review>

Shot on poor-quality Camcorder tape (complete with on-screen icons), Korine shoots himself, his wife and a couple of pals, all of them unrecognisable in face masks (probably the films greatest expense) which make them look like elderly folk, as they run amok, mostly at night, in the grotty backstreets and houses of a grim-looking American suburb. They hump trees and bins, meet weird locals and get involved in disturbing rituals. By the end, I admired its daring and its relentlessness  but was also running for the door.]]></review>

It uses the 1960s films and TV shows of Alfred Hitchcock as a starting point to explore the relationship between the Cold War and the big and small screens, between reality and fear, especially relating to American identity in the 1960s but with some nods to the present. The theme of doubles runs throughout: we meet a current Hitch lookalike and watch as Khrushchev squares up to Nixon. Theres also humour, not least in the chauvinist coffee ads which Grimonperez quotes, which helps to soften the rapid blow of ideas, some of which are clearer on a first viewing than others.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Far from being just another vehicle for Mifune, this belongs in that select group of <i>films noirs</i> which are also comedies. It's not as uproarious as its sequel <i>Sanjuro</i>, but the story of a mercenary samurai selling his services to two rival factions in a small town, and then sitting back to watch the enemies destroy each other, certainly marks a departure from the predominantly sentimental moralising of earlier Kurosawa movies. Ultra-pragmatic, unheroic Sanjuro is the centre-piece: his laziness matches the sleepiness of the town, his quirky mannerisms echo the town's gallery of grotesques, and his spasms of violence reflect the society's fundamental cruelty. If the plot sounds familiar, it's probably because Leone stole it for <i>A Fistful of Dollars</i>.]]></review>

The final of Afghan Star was watched by a third of the population and many of those who voted had never encountered democracy before. This formulaic but fascinating documentary follows four competitors from the comical audition stage through to the nerve-racking finale. <br />And while its style and structure conform to the well-worn template established by docs like Spellbound, its success lies in creating an accessible, fun way into serious issues. Music was outlawed by the Taliban for more than five years, so the mere existence of such a programme is revolutionary. Talent shows may be frivolous in the West, but to watch singers risking their lives to appear on the show and viewers trading their belongings for sim cards so they can text their votes, is a sobering reminder of how much we take for granted.]]></review>

Fortunately the story of an alternative future is realised with such visual imagination and sparky humour that it's only half way through that the plot's weaknesses become apparent. Like 1984, it looks forward from the '40s to a vast urban society ruled by an oppressive bureaucracy that has developed primitive valve computers. Pryce plays a worker in the all-powerful Ministry of Information, and the best moments arise when his flat's central heating system becomes a kind of spiritual battleground between guerrilla engineer De Niro and his state opposite number Hoskins. Here Gilliam fuses terror and comedy with real brilliance; elsewhere the plot's gaping holes reduce the film to a glittering novelty.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Thomas (Reeves), a salaryman at a software company, leads a secret double life. As 'Neo' he's a computer hacker much in demand. But only when Trinity (Moss) introduces him to charismatic seer Morpheus (Fishburne) does Neo learn that the whole world's unwittingly in the same boat: life as we know it is merely virtual reality, a 'matrix' designed by mankind's overlords to hold us in unquestioning obeisance. Not only are Morpheus and his rebel crew fighting to regain our freedom, but the leader has a bee in his bonnet: might not Neo be the One, who'll lead us to salvation? For its first hour, the second feature by the Wachowskis works well enough as an ambitious if rather portentous dystopian fantasy in the vein of <i>eXistenZ</i> and <i>Blade Runner</i>. Though sometimes a little clumsy, the frequent switches between the different 'realities' are entertainingly ingenious, Bill Pope's camerawork and Owen Paterson's designs are slickly impressive, and the effects neatly embrace Cronenbergian body horror and comic strip panache. But the characters, too, are paper thin (Keanu, especially), while the promising premise is steadily wasted as the film turns into a fairly routine action pic, complete with facile Hollywood heroics, cod kung-fu homilies and computer enhanced martial arts scenes. Weaving is engagingly odd as the rebels' arch enemy Smith, but even he can't hold the attention in what's finally yet another slice of overlong, high concept hokum.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This ghost story from the haunters' perspective (co-scripted by Michael McDowell) provides some of the most surprisingly enjoyable viewing in years. The drearily happy Maitlands (Baldwin and Davis) drive into the river, come up dead, and return to their beloved, quaint house as spooks intent on despatching the hideous New York yuppie family which had usurped their property. The humour unfolds as the horrible Deetzes (Jones and O'Hara) fill the house with revolting avant-garde art, bulldozers, and camp interior designers spitting venom; while only their mournful teenage daughter (Ryder) seems either aware of or in tune with the ghostly couple, whose failure to shine in the scare stakes finally drags them into the arms of the gunslinger-exorcist Betelgeuse (Keaton), a kind of OTT demonic Clint Eastwood of the underworld (who rids houses of unwanted humans). Off-the wall humour and some sensational sight gags make the movie, maddeningly disjointed though it sometimes is, a truly astonishing piece of work.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Fed by comic tributaries perhaps, but Pee-Wee Herman comes over as a delightful original. It's a balancing act, and he doesn't put a '50s preppy white buckskin wrong. He lives in a house which is a Heath Robinsonish turn in itself, and responds to his environment with all the restraint of a streaker in a carwash. A nasty boy steals his beloved bicycle. Pee-Wee gives chase, taking in a lot of America's tourist map and winding up in Hollywood (which buys his adventure, and we see their version too). Dreamlike situations hover on the edge of unease (a meeting with a waitress in the mouth of a model dinosaur, pursuit by her giant boyfriend waving a caveman's bone), and there's a wonderfully sustained gag in which Pee-Wee rescues animals from a burning pet shop, nervously stalling the snakes. The score works edgily against the comedy, and the dream sequences are just this side of Dali. Pee-Wee himself comes from the school of acting that usually sits under a bubble - Rage, Foiled, Idea - in a cartoon. Truly weird and wonderfully addictive.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Compared to even 'sophisticated' juvenile fodder, the sheer exuberance of Disney's adaptation of PL Travers' children's classic should tickle the most jaded fancy. Indeed, the film can hardly contain itself with its catalogue of memorable songs, battery of dance routines, and strong supporting cast. As for the leads, Julie Andrews, after beating off other pretenders to the role (in part because Walt liked the way she whistled), produced an Academy Award-winning portrayal of the Edwardian nanny whose mad magic seethes beneath a patina of respectability that is, as Mary Poppins' references state, 'practically perfect in every way'. But oh, Dick Van Dyke's Cockney accent! You can hardly understand him with his mouth open - but you probably wouldn't recognise him with his mouth closed.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Cinephiles fantasize about those mythical Holy Grails of MIA movies: the marathon cut of Erich von Stroheims <i>Greed</i>, Orson Welless ending for <i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i>, the whole of <i>London After Midnight</i>. Hope springs eternal, though finding Fritz Langs unedited version of <i>Metropolis</i>the
one that ran a little more than two-and-a-half hours, which he
premiered in Berlin in 1927was considered a lost cause. Thanks to a
stroke of luck, we now have a nearly complete restoration of the
monocled masters future-shock epiccomplete enough, at least, to
justify Kino Lorbers prefix The Complete without risking a hail of
rotten tomatoes. This is as close as were likely to get to what those
sitting in the UFA-Palast saw when the lights went down: Langs vision
of claustrophobic skylines, underground prole revolutions and fembots
run amok before the censors had their Night of the Long Scissors.</p><p>Sowhats
new? A whopping 25 minutes has been inserted back in, some of which
merely add texture (a snippet of a woman being tarted up in the
pleasure domeish Club of the Sons) and some that flesh out Langs more
elaborate sequences, such as the climactic flood in the workers
subterranean lair. But the revelations are indeed stunning: a factory
grunt enjoying the fruits of the upper class, the Lurch-like henchman
of business tycoon Joh Fredersen (Abel) stalking about, a statue of
Fredersens wife pined over by evil inventor Rotwang (Dr. Mabuse
himself, Klein-Rogge) that clarifies a major plot point. Who cares that
the found footage is scratchy and scarred by time? Its all that much
easier to identify what we once thought was gone foreverand what now
adds even more depth to a delirious, dreamlike class parable whose
dystopia still feels exhilaratingly modern.</p>]]></review>

As plot loses importance and parody reigns supreme, Falk and Maggie Smith get the best lines. However, unlike <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i> - so stylised as to be virtually a parody - here director Moore and writer Neil Simon seem to have no real affection for either the characters they plunder mercilessly for laughs, or the locked room puzzle they turn on its head. Introductions over, the film slides downhill.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Another strident, guilt-inducing eco-doc from the same distributor as The Vanishing of the Bees and other such films, Crude explores the efforts of two mismatched characters  small-town rural advocate Pablo Fajardo and New York legal eagle Steve Donziger  to bring a class-action lawsuit against oil giant Texaco for a series of alleged ecological crimes against the land and people of Amazonian Ecuador. But this is more than a simple David v Goliath tale, as director Joe Berlinger widens his scope to examine the impact of cultural change on agrarian folk struggling to keep up.<br /><br />In 2004, Berlinger unleashed the hilarious but outrageously indulgent two-and-a-half-hour moanfest, Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, on a startled world; Crude feels like his bid to turn his undoubted talents to a more righteous and timely cause. Its a bleak, necessarily incomplete tale, and suffers from a late intrusion by celebrity eco-botherer Trudi Styler. But with this gripping, angry film, Berlinger has put himself back on the side of the angels.]]></review>

But, like the best childrens stories, theyre also about something seriously scary: the separation anxiety with which all kids (and plenty of adults) are familiar and the spectre of its extreme extrapolation, total abandonment. It doesnt take a sociologist to work out why such themes might strike a chord at a time when family life is so fragile for so many; the Toy Story cycle broaches the subject with an emotional honesty that allows young viewers to exercise those anxieties in safety  even if it stops short of the kind of traumatic wallop associated with, say, Bambis mum.<br />This third outing finds the gang  Woody the cowboy (voiced by Tom Hanks), space ranger Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack), timid dinosaur Rex (Wallace Shawn) and various other dog, pig and potato-based playthings  facing the reality of their long-indifferent owner leaving for college. The toys fear indefinite leave in the attic or  worse  the trash; the middle ground is relocation to Sunnyside, a day-care centre where, perhaps, they can serve new owners. All seems well on their arrival  sweet kids, welcoming new toys  but jeopardy is, of course, around the corner.<br />The film is in 3D but, hang-gliding escapades notwithstanding, in-your-face effects take a back seat to more subtle applications, such as environmental immersion, mock-heroic playfulness and suspenseful contrasts of scale. That said, the opening adventure sequence is an assured stereo set piece and the short preceding the main feature, Day &amp; Night, a high-concept gem.<br />There are several elements in Toy Story 3 that echo its predecessors: the outside-world escape plot, the reversion of Buzz to factory-setting-level naivety, the trustworthiness of new pals. But there are also many witty novelties, from a when-Barbie-met-Ken subplot to a 2D makeover for Mr Potato Head and gags about toys as Method actors. This is also a film willing to flirt with darker matter, including mortal jeopardy at a landfill, freaky clown, monkey and baby toys and a flashback in which a toy feels abandoned. Emotional responsibility is mutable in the toy-owner dynamic: at some points the toy feels like the owners vulnerable child, at others like its diligent parent. Either role, these reassuring movies recognise at their darkest moments, can yield the kind of despair that prompts one character to growl: Were all just trash waiting to be thrown away.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Gathering his marbles (and any other weather-damaged, spring-loaded knick-knacks that may be in the vicinity) after the sepia-hued slushfest of A Very Long Engagement (2004), Frances master craftsman, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, returns with a comic potshot at the arms industry that makes for a hearty, if modest, return to form. <br />Firmly cleaving to his instantly distinguishable ersatz style in which cogs, pulleys and levers are tossed at the screen whenever possible, his story follows a band of oddballs as they administer a convoluted course of revenge on the tyrannical directors (Nicolas Mari and Andr Dussollier) of two rival weapons manufacturers. The catalyst for all this is the plight of body-popping video-store assistant Bazil (Dany Boon), whose father, we learn, is killed by a French-made landmine. To add injury to insult, Bazil is caught in the crossfire of a gun battle and gets a locally produced bullet lodged in his brain.<br />While its admirable that Jeunet has attempted to channel the mirth into a serious, unequivocally political statement, he does little to allow us to take his gestures seriously: its as if, say, Jacques Tati had chosen to make a film about the Rwandan genocide and insisted on keeping the silly hat. The point at which were supposed to see the funny side of extraordinary rendition is the glib gibe that pushes it over the edge. Yet, the film has its pleasures, namely the nimble, assured camera work and a script (written with regular Jeunet collaborator Guillaume Laurant) that constantly evokes the droll spirit of his hero, Jacques Prvert. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[American critics have taken this new big-screen version of the iconic 80s TV series to task, claiming its dumb, loud and painfully superficial.<br /><br />All three criticisms are wholly appropriate. But what in hell were they expecting? For audiences willing to switch their brain into disbelief-suspension mode, The A-Team is just as dumb, loud and superficial as it needs to be.<br />Its basically an origin story, as our four outlaw heroes meet in a hail of bullets on an undercover mission in the Mexican desert before being posted to Iraq and framed for treason. Eyebrows were raised when Liam Neeson agreed to pick up George Peppards stogie-chewing mantle as Captain Hannibal Smith, but he just about maintains his dignity, forming a solid core of thespian gravitas for his wisecracking sidemen Face (Bradley Cooper) and Murdock (Sharlto Copley) to run circles around. <br />Director Joe Carnahan (Narc, Smokin Aces) marshals proceedings with a thunderous and gleeful absence of subtlety: zip-pans, smash edits and MTV-style freeze-frames abound, and many of the action scenes are so jerky and cluttered that its hard to know whats going on. But when those same sequences involve looping-the-loop helicopters, avalanches of shipping crates and tanks plummeting from burning aeroplanes, perhaps its for the best.<br />So, of course, the plot could be tighter, the script less clich ridden, the action clearer and the performances not so broad. But as an unfussy, streamlined example of old-school Hollywood summer cinema at its purest and most unpretentious, The A-Team scores at least a B.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Less a baseball movie than a romantic comedy based around the sacred diamond. Each season, Annie (Sarandon) - devout believer in the Church of Baseball - favours one member of the Durham Bulls minor league team with her patented instruction in the subtle arts of baseball and love-making. Selecting young acolyte Ebby (Robbins), she initiates him into the secret of 'breathing through your eyelids', encourages him to wear a suspender belt while pitching, and ties him to a bed to read him extracts from Whitman's erotic poem 'I Sing the Body Electric'. The seasoned Crash (Costner) meanwhile grooms the youngster for a shot at the major league, concentrating on his fast but undisciplined pitching, because he throws like he fucks, all over the place. Paradoxically, writer/director Shelton's intimate knowledge of baseball allows him to convey the feel of the game, its esoteric mythology and quirky superstitions, without losing sight of the real issue: when will Annie and Crash get it together? The film's delicious charge stems not from a rush towards a big game climax, but from the aching pleasure of Crash and Annie's potential consummation. Exuding easy charm, Costner confirms his status as <i>the</i> romantic leading man of the late '80s; Sarandon is sexier reading Emily Dickinson's poems fully clothed than most actresses would be writhing naked on a bed; together, they are indeed the bodies electric. Marvellous stuff.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Onto the boggy marshlands of Skarrild, a southern hamlet of Denmark, tread several figuresand not just the characters of this noirish quirkfest. First comes the pompadoured shadow of David Lynch, whose <i>Blue Velvet</i> and <i>Twin Peaks</i> seem to figure prominently in the films plot of an outsider cop (Cedergren) encountering townie resistance from a mysterious femme fatale (Christensen) and her deranged husband (Bodnia). Then come the visages of two shorter men, the Coen brothers: playful genre subverters no doubt kept in mind during the writing of scenes involving lots of arch verbal sparringand, in one Western-indebted instance, a beer-pounding showdown in a bar.</p><p>Finally, lets be generous and notice the presence of actual director Henrik Ruben Genz. T<i>erribly Happy</i> synthesizes all of these influences in a way thats rarely boring. Even if originality isnt Genzs strong suit, hes done his amiable cast and crew proud. Youll like the movie much more when it seems to be mocking the idea of small-town corruption, as did something like <i>Hot Fuzz </i>or (yes)<i> Fargo.</i> Seriousness does eventually take the lead in the latter goings-on and youll wonder who laid an M. Night Shyamalan. Still, the film is vigorous exercise for those who prefer their mysteries knowing and knotty.</p>]]></review>

Many of the threatened shortcomings of earlier Kurosawa films here reach fruition: extremely crude psychological characterisation of the gallery of down-and-outs, lushly melodramatic score, explicit statement of themes by several of the characters for anyone who's missed the point, grossly stylised acting and design (particularly the use of colour symbolism, this being Kurosawa's first film in colour). Nevertheless, there's a laudable fluidity in the way the characters are knitted together into a cyclical narrative, and some of them have moments of quiet poignancy.]]></review>

The film star Gaby Doriot (Miranda) attempts suicide, and under anaesthetic she recalls the events that shaped her life. Commerce, industry and high finance are viewed with sharp irony throughout, but the melodrama centres on a seductive ambiguity: is Gaby a victim of those around her, or their willing accomplice?

      <review><![CDATA[This state-of-the-art action comedy is a cruel satire on a PC society where sex, smoking, swearing and salt are banned, and violence has been eradicated. Cryogenically frozen in 1996, psychotic criminal Phoenix (Snipes) and LA cop Spartan (Stallone) are defrosted in 2036: the former to sort out sewer-dwelling eco-terrorists, the latter to clear up the mess left by his old arch-enemy. In sprawling 21st century San Angeles, under benevolent dictator Dr Cocteau (Hawthorne), the only weapons are in a museum. Phoenix escapes and heads straight for them, and the duplicitous Cocteau admits that Spartan's ultra violent methods may be necessary to restore boring normality. First-time director Brambilla stages the senseless violence with skill and relish, aided by producer Joel Silver's trademark mega-explosions. Forget your preconceptions, but not your brain cells and sense of irony.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Nigel Kneale was presumably responsible for the Quatermass-like opening: astronauts on the moon find a faded Union Jack and a note dated 1899, while back on Earth, an old man in a nursing home babbles about terrible dangers. But then this HG Wells adaptation turns very tame indeed, with the principals rendered as bumbling Victorian comics by a serviceable if not very exciting cast, and Juran taking it all far too slowly. Once on the moon ('colour by Lunacolor') things perk up, though Ray Harryhausen has mixed success with his monsters. The giant centipede isn't bad, but the belligerent beetles are too obviously chaps in rubber suits. No poetic effusions, incidentally, for Lionel Jeffries, on taking that pioneering small step. 'Hello, moon,' he says brightly.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Kurosawa was pressured by his producers into directing this sequel to <i>Yojimbo</i>, and rose to the occasion by making his funniest and least overtly didactic film. The plot has Sanjuro (Mifune) running lazy rings around nine would-be samurai and two genteel ladies while cleaning up a spot of corruption in local government. Kurosawa plays most of it for laughs by expertly parodying the conventions of Japanese period action movies, but the tone switches to a magnificent vehemence in the heart-stopping finale.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Period/Swashbucklers]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[<p>In many ways, <i>Kagemusha</i> feels like an attempt at a career-summarizing film. Like much of Kurosawas work, it is preoccupied with illusion and reality, with the effort to live up to an honorable code of conduct and with the use of action to express character. Its very likely that Kurosawa thought of the film as a summary statement; he had legitimate reasons to believe that <i>Kagemusha</i> might be his final film. But the end Kurosawa contemplates isnt merely his own; he sees a whole world passing away.</p><p>Tired of his costly perfectionism, the faltering Japanese studios were unenthusiastic about backing Kurosawa, especially for another historical epic. (On <i>Throne of Blood</i>, hed famously demanded that a set be rebuilt because it was constructed with historically inaccurate nails.) The situation had become so dire that in the early 1970s, Kurosawa went to the Soviet Union to make <i>Dersu Uzala</i> because he couldnt get a project off the ground in Japan. Without the money to make a film, Kurosawa spent much of the 1970s painting storyboards of the action of <i>Kagemusha</i>. (These beautiful images can be seen on Criterions outstanding DVD of the film.)</p><p>As film scholar Stephen Prince notes in his excellent book <i>The Warriors Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa</i>, Kurosawas mood in the 1970s was bleak. He saw modernity winning out entirely over the traditional virtues he reveredduty, honor, the clear hierarchies in which he believed humane impulses thrive. He also found himself a sage without any disciples; the next generation of Japanese filmmakers was not interested in his formal and aesthetic rigor.</p><p>Its little wonder then that <i>Kagemusha</i> imagines the end of the samurai era essentially as an apocalypse. But, since this is Kurosawa, the apocalypse is a carefully composed affair, told in perfectly framed tableaux.</p><p>The plot sounds like an absurd contrivance drawn from the theater: A thief is saved from execution because of his uncanny resemblance to a feudal warlord. Hes given life in exchange for acting as a double to confuse the warlords enemies. When the warlord dies, his last request is that the thief carry on the charade for three years so the clan will not collapse in disarray. Yes, its <i>The Prince and the Pauper</i> with samurai swords. Incredibly, its also based on fact. When the real Takeda Shingen died in 1572, he left instructions to keep his death a secret for three years, something his son accomplished using an impersonator.</p><p>Kurosawa presents the story from an aestheticized distance that is almost clinical. Take the striking opening scene: We see three identically dressed, seated men in long shot, as though from across a great hall. From this distance, they look identical. In the center is the warlord Shingen (Nakadai). On the left is his brother Nobukado (Yamazaki), and on the right is the nameless thief (also played by Nakadai). Kurosawa refuses to cut in for a close-up to capture reactions, instead leaving us to contemplate how much the three look alike (We later learn that Nobukado often impersonates his brother). </p><p>Kurosawa remains in long shots for many of the films big moments, forcing his viewer to contemplate the role of individuals in something far larger than themselves. In huge battles and scenes of court ritual, we are positioned as observers of history watching at a distance as the impending catastrophe unfolds.</p><p><i>Kagemusha</i> is a hard film to warm to. Kurosawas next film, <i>Ran</i>an adaptation of <i>King Lear</i>invites us into the mind of its protagonist (also played by <i>Kagemusha</i> star Nakadai), making the tragedy psychological. But in <i>Kagemusha</i>, Kurosawa resists that impulse. Both films end with a bleak image of mans place in the universe: <i>Ran</i> has a blind man walking toward a cliff; Kagemusha closes with a body floating down a river past the submerged banner of a doomed clan. The blind man of <i>Ran</i> may be a more universal image of despair, but it at least gives mans struggle a poetic grandeur. <i>Kagemusha</i> rips away even that. The thiefs death has been a final meaningless sacrifice in a pointless battle. Its a far darker worldview than we might expect, but its the logical endpoint of many of Kurosawas career-long themes.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Like a photocopy of a photocopy, <i>Shrek the Third</i> retains the outlines and general form of the original, but the details arent
as crisp. It has nothing to do with the films look, of course; the
computer animation has gotten better in the intervening years. Its the
plotting, the voice characterizations, and even the zingy topical
references that are muddy and vague.
          
		  
<p>Shrek (Myers) and Fiona (Diaz) face new challenges: Shes preggers,
hes having sitcom-style anxieties about impending fatherhood (har,
har) and the king has died, leaving Shrek the presumptive heir.
(Apparently, Far, Far Away remains sexist; Fiona and her mother are
never even considered in the line of succession.) Shrek doesnt want to
be king, and so he fetches Artie (Timberlake), the next in line.
Meanwhile, Prince Charming (Everett) plots a coup. Artie and Shrek both
have to learn to step up to a challenge and to disregard the judgments
of others (lessons we thought Shrek had learned long ago). The moral is
pounded home with child-friendly regularity.
	</p>					
				The jokes are amusing rather than hilarious (we laughed at some, but
we shrugged at a lot of others) and Myers in particular seems oddly
subdued, as though he couldnt muster the energy to be funny. No more
for us, thanks. Threes our limit.<i> </i>]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Children's]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[One of the more curious aspects of recent Hollywood cinema has been a desire to make the conceptually outlandish psychologically mundane. Yeah, Christopher Nolan invites us to think, when you put it like that, I can see why a guy might dress up as a bat and fight crime. Peter Jackson doesnt just want us to marvel at or pity a 20ft ape, he wants to unpack its abandonment issues. And recently, Wes Anderson granted a talking animal enough pop-psych introspection to acknowledge, I have this thing where I need everyone to think Im this quote-unquote Fantastic Mr Fox.<br />Spike Jonzes adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are, Maurice Sendaks beloved story about Max, a naughty boy in a wolf suit who sails away to an exotic jungle and meets giant beasties who make him their king, takes this tendency even further. In expanding the couple of dozen pages of Sendaks picture-book to feature length, Jonze and his co-writer, Dave Eggers, approach atavistic fantasy with jarring formal and psychological realism. The forest, desert and mountain locations are real, as are the creature costumes (CGI facial expressions aside); beautifully photographed, often in handheld shots and magic-hour light, these landscapes and figures have a solidity, weight and detail that feels uncanny in an age of virtual imagining.<br />Lumbering around their island with satisfying heft, these weird beasts  hybrids of human, animal and mythical parts that faithfully realise Sendaks drawings  have an oddly quotidian social dynamic and comically normal names: insecure Judith and Alexander (voiced by Catherine OHara and Paul Dano), more assured Ira and Douglas (Forest Whitaker and Chris Cooper), gruff but vulnerable Carol (James Gandolfini). Feeling less like a pack of monsters than a group of long-arrested adolescents left to their own devices, they entertain crushes, grudges and neuroses, pile gleefully into group projects, sustain minor injuries and go off in sulks, yearning for structure and security all the while. Think Lord of the Flies on Fraggle Rock. Finding himself in loco parentis, Max must take emotional responsibility, and one of the films pleasures is young Max Recordss deft and unaffected portrayal of this shift. <br />Its hard to guess whether many children will enjoy the movie. Ponderous at times, it could probably be 15 minutes shorter and lacks a real sense of mortal danger. Theres also sometimes an over-determined feel to the correspondences between the island adventure and Maxs real life with his mother (Catherine Keener) and sister, as laid out in the opening scenes. But Where the Wild Things Are stands out for its unusually potent evocation of the timbre of childhood imagining, with its combination of the outr and the banal, grand schemes jumbled up with delicate feelings and the urge to smash things up.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Just in time for Christmas, a seasonal horror from W  Z director Tom Shankland that jabs an icicle in your eye. Two families get together in an isolated cottage to share a little Yuletide cheer. Then one by one, the children fall ill and turn on the adults with a blank-faced spite that shocks even their loving parents. An accident with a sledge is a harbinger of worse to come. Innocent childrens playthings  bright yellow play tents, climbing frames and pencils  are imbued with a scary malevolence. Stranded in limbo is moody teenager Casey (a compelling performance by Hollyoaks actor Hannah Tointon) whose adult intelligence is shot through with an infantile ruthlessness.<br />This taboo-shattering movie taps in to primal fears about the unknow-ability of children, its blood-stained virgin snow and insidious terror recalling cruel fairy tales and demon child movies such as The Omen. Shanklands approach is oblique rather than graphic, but these icy chills will send shivers down your spine.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>One of the benchmarks of progress in digital animation has been the
increased ability to animate fur realistically. But Wes Anderson has no
more interest in realism in animation than he did in representing life
at a boarding school in <i>Rushmore</i>. Thats why he opted for stop-motion for <i>Fantastic Mr. Fox</i>. Anderson loves the handcrafted look, and you could spend much of <i>Fox</i>
being hypnotized by the way the real fur on the animal figures ripples
and moves in little waves that have nothing to do with the movements of
fur in real life and everything to do with the way stop-motion fur in
old movies and television specials moves.</p><p><i>Fox</i> is not a
kids movie exactly; its more like a movie for adults with an intense
nostalgia for their inner child, with some Anderson-specific family
dynamics thrown in for good measure. Corduroy-suit-clad Fox (Clooney,
whose voice <i>sounds</i> like corduroy), who long ago retired from
thievery to settle down with his wife (Streep) and son Ash
(Schwartzman), feels the pull of his old life and plots a series of
heists on local farms. Meanwhile, miserable Ash has daddy issues (not
in the original Roald Dahl book) and a fierce but one-sided rivalry
with his ultra-suave cousin (Eric Anderson). </p><p><i>Fox</i> chugs
along fueled by Wes Andersons usual mix of wistfulness, visual
precision, frontal tableaux (which seem more at home in an animated
film), eccentric music choices (Burl Ives alert!) and complicated
psychodynamics played for half-laughs. Its also a fairly entertaining
childrens story. But for kids? Lets say its a film for Wes Anderson.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A bloodsucking baby, its bloodthirsty mother (Ladd) and one kooky granny (Rose) bent on resuming the glory days of breast-feeding: Welcome to Lamaze for lunatics. Paul Solets gyno-horror flick is certainly twisted but only slightly unnerving; the movie is about as gripping as one might expect given that its infant monster is both mute and cradle-bound. Some Sundance pundits were enthralled by the maternal subversion, but once the new mom goes nuts after being light-headed from losing so much type O, its clear theres no third act in sight.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Its Chicago release suffers from atrocious timing (to say the least), but <i>The Little Traitor</i>,
adapted from a novel by Israeli writer Amos Oz, is the rare family film
that traffics primarily in ideas rather than cutes. The son of Polish
immigrants waiting out the remainder of the British rule in Palestine,
Proffy (Ido Port) forges a friendship with an English soldier named Sgt.
Dunlop (Alfred Molina) after Dunlop cuts Proffy a break when catching him out
past curfew. Proffy helps Dunlop with his Hebrew; Dunlop teaches Proffy
about life. But socializing with the British was generally considered
taboo among Israeli nationalists, and Proffys family and friends begin
to suspect that Proffy may be feeding his new friend information.</p><p>Tracing
the way ideology can lead to unjustified mistrust, the movie is
stronger when it sticks to this theme than when it turns into a
half-pint Fellini picture, with Proffy lusting after a fetching
neighbor (Anat Klausner). The mawkish coda, too, should have ended up on the
cutting-room floor. But the film intelligently shows how Israeli
society was divided against itself from the start, and its moralthat
dialogue is never something to be fearedis a lesson the country would
do well to heed today.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Youre old, pretentious, a misogynist, full of yourself, vain, borderline racist, a tacky dresser, childish and not funny, says agent 117s new Mossad partner Dolors Koulechov (Louise Monot) in co-writer-director Michel Hazanaviciuss sequel to his 2008 Bond spoof Cairo: Nest of Spies. Shall I go on? Oh, yes! Please do. For if some of the zest, originality and fluency of 2006s first parody of Jean Bruces plentiful and often lamely adapted spy novels is missing, the spot-on period design, puerile sight gags, laughable cinematic quotes  Hitchcocks the main victim  and the enthusiasm of comedian Jean Dujardins playing of the supercilious Gaullist maladroit are all present and incorrect. The mission is to track down Rdiger Voglers Nazis in Brazil  cue vertiginous fights on the arms of Christ the Redeemer and set pieces more tasteless than The Producers  but its the grooving to composer Ludovic Bources fab xylophone beats and Dujardins hyena laugh and heroic self-regard youll remember.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Neil Jordan has fallen into a regular pattern of late, following every trip to Hollywood with a more personal Irish indie. You can feel the loving care in every frame of Ondine, but that only serves to make this saccharine, crudely plotted romance feel even more misguided. <br />Colin Farrell plays Syracuse, a trawlerman and recovering alcoholic who pulls a mysterious, scantily clad woman (Alicja Bachleda) from the sea in his net. Bringing her to the mainland, Syracuse and his disabled daughter (the terrific Alison Barry) become convinced that the stranger, who calls herself Ondine, is in fact a mythical selkie: part woman, part seal. <br />These unabashed fairy-tale elements fit uncomfortably with the more earthbound elements of Jordans script, not to mention his habit of getting Bachleda to shed her clothes at every opportunity. A clunky third-act shift into thriller territory only makes Ondine more confused: ambitious and deeply felt, to be sure, but also winsome and wildly uneven.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Originally banned in Britain for its comic-strip iconoclasm and graphic violence, this rates alongside Leone's 'Dollars' trilogy as one of the daddies of the spaghetti/paella Western. It's a clean- up-and-paint-the-town-blood-red revenge drama with a difference. Nero's mud-spattered ex-Yankee soldier, first seen squelching towards a US-Mexican border ghost town, a coffin forever in tow, has every Western hero's quality <i>in extremis</i>. His speed-of-light gunslinger outlaw has a romantic heart - his wife was killed by one of Major Jackson's KKK-like henchmen - and an enigmatic morality. He solves the war between Jackson's men and General Rodrguez' bandidos by dispensing death to all, but his sympathies are shown when he later teams up with Rodrguez for a gold heist. Corbucci's style is a mix of social realism, highly decorative visuals, and finely mounted action sequences. For the rest, there are enough mud-wrestling prostitutes, whippings, ear-loppings,  explosions and scenes of wholesale slaughter to keep any <i>muchacho </i>happy. Funny, visceral, bloody, no-nonsense entertainment with a touch of class.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Set just before World War I, this corny musical introduced 30-year-old debutant Gene Kelly in the intially unsympathetic role of an ambitious hoofer who joins up with fellow vaudevillians Garland and Murphy in the, hope of fulfilling his/their dream of playing at the famous Palace Theatre. Their plans are complicated by Kelly's selfish scheming to avoid the draft, and by a romantic triangle in which Murphy loves Garland, Garland loves Kelly, and Kelly loves, besides himself, the idea of being famous. Kelly's contrived transformation from ruthless heel to self-effacing war hero is totally unconvincing, but the excellent numbers - including the title song, 'When You Wore a Tulip' and 'Ballin' the Jack' - may help to numb the pain.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Returning to the rich pastures of American suburbia, Spielberg takes the utterly commonplace story of a lonely kid befriending an alien from outer space, and invests it with exactly the same kind of fierce and naive magic that pushed Disney's major masterpieces like <i>Pinocchio</i> into a central place in 20th century popular culture. Moreover, with its Nativity-like opening and its final revelation, the plot of <i>E.T.</i> has parallels in religious mythology that help to explain its electric effect on audiences. But although conclusively demonstrating Spielberg's preeminence as the popular artist of his time, <i>E.T.</i> finally seems a less impressive film than <i>Close Encounters</i>. This is partly because its first half contains a couple of comedy sequences as vulgar as a Brooke Bond TV chimps commercial, but more because in reducing the unknowable to the easily loveable, the film sacrifices a little too much truth in favour of its huge emotional punch.]]></review>

In a DeLorean time machine they travel back to 1955, the year his parents met in high school. But at that age, mom rather fancies her offspring more than his prospective father. Zemeckis takes obvious pleasure in solving not just the technical but also the emotional problems of time travel: how to avoid incest, how to unite your parents in order that you will be born, how to return to the future when both the car and the professor have blown a fuse, and above all how to avoid tampering with history. If this all sounds schematic, it shouldn't: the movie has all the benign good nature of a Frank Capra.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Adapted, unexpectedly, from one of Ed McBain's 87th Precinct novels (<i>King's Ransom</i>), this emerges as part thriller and part morality play in the manner characteristic of Kurosawa. After bringing off a big financial coup, a tycoon finds that his son has been kidnapped. Prepared to ruin himself to pay the ransom, he realises that his chauffeur's son was abducted by mistake. The first half, set in a single room, echoes Hitchcock's <i>Rope</i> in exploring his moral dilemma while the action takes place off-screen. The second is disconcertingly different in that it focuses excitingly on the police procedures deployed in the hunt for the kidnapper. But the connections, though sometimes overly obvious in appealing to the liberal conscience, span fascinating Dostoevskian depths.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Made between <i>Seven Samurai</i> and <i>Throne of Blood</i>, this contemporary social problem movie is Kurosawa's least commercially successful work. Mifune is the ageing, patriarchal head of a Tokyo family who, terrified at the prospect of a nuclear war, decides to sell up the family business and emigrate to a farm in Brazil. With Mifune uncomfortable playing a character twice his real age, and the character himself rendered incoherent by a script which seems uncertain whether it's him or society which is insane, a volunteer court official (Shimura) - required to adjudicate in the ensuing family squabble - a little awkwardly assumes the role of moral centre. It's a problematic film, wearing its uncertainties on its sleeve; but whether shooting in long takes or cutting the footage from multiple camera shooting, Kurosawa remains the cinema's supremely humanist emotional manipulator. See it and worry.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The story of a destroyer, its crew, and their flashback memories of the folks back home from a raft after being dive-bombed during the Battle of Crete. Staged with what passed at the time for honest understatement, it now looks impossibly patronising, the epitome of stiff upper lip as Coward's captain graciously condescends to his forelock- touching crew like an indulgent auntie. Interesting chiefly as a reminder of the structures of snobbery and privilege in the services which were largely responsible for Labour's postwar election victory.]]></review>

Regrettably, the movie dips in the second half, when attention shifts from Douglas's attempts to persuade Dunne to go public, to her efforts to make him stand up to his corrupt politician father.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>News addicts wont resist imagining Judith Miller and Valerie Plame in this Washington film  clef about a journalist (Beckinsale) who exposes a CIA agent (Farmiga) and then goes to jail for refusing to reveal her source. Seeing Rod Lurie tell their story is both exhilarating and frustrating: So few movies dare to tackle intelligent, provocative, socially relevant topics in a mature framework that doesnt condescend. But theres a halfway point when the rush of watching the inner machinations of power players turns into the listless predictability of a TV courtroom drama, crossed with the voyeurism of a mild grindhouse prison movie.</p><p>Still, Lurie does maintain a pulse, if only for the feminist refrain that surfaces as each woman struggles to fight her respective system, both of which are tinged with nagging suspicions about female competence. The sexism, which to my memory never had a significant role in the reality of the situation (barring Scooter Libbys oddly romantic note to Miller), plays well here as yet another tool to ratchet up the tension. Except, of course, when it doesnt: The twist ending is the maudlin cherry on top that aims for profundity but ends up making the womens travails even more superficial. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Every middle-aged Saturday Night Live alumnus grazing the wider pastures of Hollywood comes to a big decision: do you follow the model of Steve Martin and traipse into middlebrow mania? Or, like Bill Murray (and, to a lesser degree, the Mike Myers of The Love Guru), do you pursue your muse even further into go-it-alone weirdness? Adam Sandler may have made his choice. After flirting with some fascinating sourness in Judd Apatows Funny People, hes ready to sweeten up a bit; Grown Ups, a benignly crude slice of family hysteria, reunites him with ex-SNL-ers Chris Rock, David Spade and Rob Schneider (plus obligatory chubster Kevin James), as former 12-year-old basketball teammates drawn together decades later when their coach kicks the bucket.<br />Back to their old summer lodge they go, along with several impossibly attractive wives  the breast-feeding Maria Bello; a quietly dominating Maya Rudolph; high-strung fashion fiend Salma Hayek Pinault (who?)  plus a swarm of carefully written kids destined to wise up in the great outdoors. No viewer goes into this movie expecting John Cassavetess Husbands, least of all from soft-serve director Denis Dugan (You Dont Mess with the Zohan). But would it have been such a crushing blow to these stars egos if theyd accommodated a little honest anxiety, instead of the typical lake-rope-swinging mishaps and an inevitable Steve Buscemi cameo? Telegraphed down to the final shot of a basketball contest, Grown Ups suggests a mask being torn off to reveal another one: the male fantasy of cheerleader spouse, well-adjusted kids and expanding waistline.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This remake of the 1984 weedy-kid-makes-good parable is a fascinating example of how fine the line is between success and failure in films. The story is still great, and in shifting the action to urban China, director Harald Zwart and his writers have refreshed an old set-up. The cast are solid  Jackie Chan makes for an oddly vulnerable Miyagi (now Mr Han)  and the script, though overlong, moves at a crackling pace.<br />But the makers have made one giant misstep, and it sinks the film: in reducing their hero from streetwise teen Daniel-san to gobby 12-year-old Dre (Jaden Smith), theyve completely altered the tone of the piece, changing it from a goofy, uplifting coming-of-age drama into a distressing, queasy tale of bullying and retribution. Everything about Dre feels written for an older actor  his tense relationship with his mum, his awkward courtship of a local girl, and the final battle, in which the sight of crowds cheering a battered pre-teen into bone-crunching combat just feels jaw-droppingly inappropriate. Come back, Ralph Macchio. All  even Karate Kid 3  is forgiven.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A loose remake of the 1940 special effects extravaganza with Victor Mature, Hammer's version of the life and times of cavemen and women again cheerfully neglects a few million years of evolution and has our antecedents living side by side with the brontosauri. There's a simple story about lovers from different tribes, and Welch grunts beautifully clad only in a few bits of bunny fur, but the real stars are Ray Harryhausen's superbly animated dinosaurs. It was Hammer's biggest box-office hit and inaugurated a cycle, but the more cheaply made sequels were no match for the ferocious reptile fights on display here.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Fine as long as it sticks to recreation of period and place, and stays with a simple enough plot - 1964 mod Daniels' Brighton beach battles with the Rockers, and his on/off love affair with Ash. But as the film progresses, it becomes bogged down in silly moralising and metaphysics, struggling to accommodate itself to the absurd story of The Who's rock opera. Good performances, though, and directed with admirable energy for the first half.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Despite Streisand's apparently hypnotic hold over a large portion of the earth's population, it's still almost impossible to equate the critical plaudits already bestowed on <i>Yentl</i> with the movie itself. This lumbering, overwrought, and wildly self-indulgent adaptation of Isaac Bashevis Singer's frail short story is clearly cranked up with the full quotient of sincerity and conviction. But it is this very earnestness of tone that topples a pretty dubious premise - Streisand dresses up as a boy in order to learn the Talmud - into galloping bathos. The end result looks like nothing so much as the raw material for every Woody Allen Jewish joke ever coined.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>In its opening scene, this Depression-era drama appears to be the story of a prisoners return to society: The camera descends into the fields to introduce us to Homer (Beckford), whos been unjustly jailed for stealing to feed his family. But once Homer relocates to a small Southern town, the focus widens to the ensemble. Theres Lucy (Washington), a seamstress who struggles to hold down a job in a factory that shows no mercy to its employees; Gracie (Whitfield), a widowed boarding-house proprietress whos lost her sense of dignity; and Clarence (Turman), a neer-do-well who just needs a little confidence. The two men compete to perform in a weekly contest to be crowned king of the evening for the towns African-American community. For them, its a way to stay optimistic even when theyre down-and-out.</p><p>A hit at last summers Black Harvest Film Festival, the movie resourcefully evokes its setting on a low budget, despite scoring thats a little overbearing at times (and at least one plot thread whose outcome smacks of wish fulfillment). Modestly scaled and well-acted, the film gets a lot of small details right without winding up anywhere in particular.</p>]]></review>

Its been on the cards for a while now  last years Apatow-goes-improv male-bonding comedy Humpday came close to breaking out of the indie ghetto  but Cyrus marks the point when this long-percolating DIY hipster subgenre, famed for its naturalistic dialogue, awkward pauses and painfully extended camera takes, finally hits the big time.<br />Its largely down to the cast: John C Reilly plays John, a divorced schlub who thinks hes hit the jackpot when he successfully hits on foxy singleton Molly (Marisa Tomei) at a swanky LA party. But theres always a catch, and in this case its Cyrus (Jonah Hill), Mollys live-at-home twentysomething son, whose Oedipal intimacy with his oblivious mum puts a spanner in Johns romantic dreams.<br />Enormous respect is due to directors Mark and Jay Duplass, whose transition to Hollywood hasnt compromised their singular filmmaking style even a fraction. The result is as warm and wise as the brothers homemade debut, The Puffy Chair, while retaining their commitment to sly genre subversion which began with disassembled horror pastiche Baghead. Cyrus can be viewed as just an effective and intimate romantic comedy, albeit with a pitch-dark edge of discomfort stemming largely from Hills chilling, revelatory performance. <br />But its also a witty reflection on Hollywoods traditional ideas of romance and family, particularly among characters of a certain age: simply by treating these characters as real, with all the uncertainty, emotional baggage and bad decisions that entails, the Duplasses expertly expose the hypocrisy of the airbrushed all-American ideal.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Indias most intelligent and respected director, Tamilian Ratnams latest bilingual (Hindi/Tamil) film is solid and superior Bollywood entertainment. The bastard Beera (Bachchan) kidnaps the arrogant and fearless Ragini (Rai-Bachchan), wife of no-nonsense cop Dev (Vikram). On one level, the plot is dosa-thin: will Dev rescue Ragini safely? But this is a modern update on the revered Hindu epic Sanskrit text The Ramayana (c.300 BC). Ratnams characterisation kicks in after the first chase and thrills hour, giving us a feisty female protagonist who has to question her perception of her captor as either raavan (demon) or Robin Hood. Performances attract admiration, Oscar-winner A R Rahmans energetic rustic tunes charm and the cinematography of a monsoonal rural India is stunning. Unlike its mythological evil namesake, this Raavan is ravishingly good.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[David Leans black-and-white masterpiece may be a whirlwind tour of Dickens novel, but what a well-performed, economic and atmospheric tour it is, and one that manages in two hours to capture much of the chronological and emotional sweep of a 525-page novel. Leans superb opening recreation of the ominous Kent marshes, with young Pip (Anthony Wager) hurrying past a series of gallows-posts, sets the scene for this young childs brush with fate and accidental elevation to a young London gentleman (played then by John Mills, already too old at 38). The characters have the same immediate power as on the page: Bernard Miles is gentle, damaged and good as Joe Gargery; Finlay Currie is terrifying and vulnerable as Magwitch; Martita Hunts imperial Miss Havisham has nasty charm; and Jean Simmons young Estella is dangerously alluring. A 32-year-old Alec Guinness (from whose stage-production the film emerged) is excellent as Pips oh-so-decent companion, Herbert Pocket. And Pips awkward scenes with Joe Gargery relate as powerfully now to themes of class, home, aspiration and snobbery as in 1946 and the mid nineteenth century. See it!]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In 1946 a young New England banker, Andy Dufresne (Robbins), is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to life at the Shawshank State Prison - twice over. Quiet and introspective, he gradually strikes up a friendship with the prison 'fixer', Red (Freeman), and over the next two decades wins the trust of the governor and guards, but in his heart, he still yearns for freedom. Darabont's adaptation of a Stephen King novella is a throwback to the kind of serious, literate drama Hollywood used to make (<i>Birdman of Alcatraz</i>, say) though the big spiritual resolution takes some swallowing - ditto the colour-blind relationships within the prison and the violent disavowal of any homosexual implications. Against this weighs the pleasure of discovering a first-time director with evident respect for the intelligence of his audience, brave enough to let character details accumulate without recourse to the fast-forward button. Darabont plays the long game and wins: this is an engrossing, superbly acted yarn, while the Shawshank itself is a truly formidable mausoleum.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>When watching this wise and moving modern parable from the former French colony and west African state of Chad, its worth  bearing in mind that soon after director Mahamat-Saleh Haroun (Bye Bye Africa, Abouna) started shooting in the Chad capital of NDjamena, civil war eruped yet again and regularly threatened the safety of his crew as they continued filming. Youd never know it, though, from the quiet storytelling and subtle performances that define Daratt, which, like Harouns earlier Abouna, assumes an intimate focus and a gifted humanism but leaves the viewer thinking much more widely than just about the lives of the characters on screen. Its apt, too, considering the threat to the films production, that Harouns purpose is to show that cycles of violence and predetermind patterns of war can sometimes be avoided by personal strength alone.</p><p>As in Abouna, the absence of a parent hangs over Daratt, but this time we know what became of the father of 20-year-old Atim (Ali Bacha Barka): he was killed during the civil war by Nassara (Youssouf Djaoro), an ageing, weak man who now lives comfortably as a baker in the Chad capital. As the film opens, the radio declares a government amnesty for all war criminals, yet Atims blind grandfather responds angrily by giving his taciturn, impressionable grandson a gun and sending him to avenge his sons death. When Atim finds Nassara, he hesitates, and rather than firing the gun in his pocket he takes a job and a bed from Nassara. Its now that the films most interesting conundrums kick in. Will he carry out his mission? Will he reciprocate the paternal fondness shown him by an unsuspecting Nassara? And is Nassara as unsuspecting as he appears? Blessed with a near-silent but always telling performance from Barka, Haroun dances around all these questions and more, but only allows an answer in the superb final moments: until then, the debate is as much with us as with Atim. Beautifully and simply photographed on location, Daratt is a fine follow-up to Abouna and confirms Haroun as one of Africas leading filmmakers, a committed humanist and a sly political commentator.</p>]]></review>

King of what? Nowhereland. Which is to say Evans a harried financial
executive, and this is another loathsome family comedy in which a busy
father is made to feel like a horrible parent until he abandons earning
money and conforms to his childs every whim. This kind of ritual
castration is a mainstay of such kid-friendly fare, and it has extra
venom here given the current financial meltdown (unmentioned but
unavoidable).<br /></p><p>The plothigh-concept whimsy wherein Olivias
blanket and imaginary friends give awesome financial advice, bringing
Evan closer to his daughter when he reaps the benefit of their
wisdomis no big deal. Youngsters will probably be fine with Eddie
Murphys unamusing mugging and Hakuna matata quoting; for dads, its
undoubtedly grating that the big meeting is always scheduled against
the school concert. Responsible parenting is apparently the willingness
to look like an idiot in public and driving recklessly to make it to
school on time. Only Thomas Haden Church emerges with any credit, as a
shifty Native American adviser who thanks investors for letting me
bring my venison to your potlatch.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>It turns out that the battle between good vampires and bad vampires all comes down to hair. Eternally-17 vamp dreamboat Edward Cullen (Pattinson) has a hypnotic head of honey-colored hair that makes him look like James Dean after an aggressive application of volumizer. Evil vamp James (Gigandet) wears his blonde tresses in a badass-biker ponytail. Good vamps use styling product. Bad vamps dont. And good hair, pasty skin, a lot of brooding and inexplicable mood shifts are catnip to Bella (Stewart) the new girl in perpetually overcast Forks, Washington. Shes drawn to Edward, even when he admits that his first desire upon meeting her was to drink her dry. Shes totally ready for that, but hes trying to save her from her own desires. Do you sense a twisted sexual metaphor at work?</p><p>Hardwicke seems most invested in examining Bellas teen-girl lust, captured with the <i>Thirteen</i> directors usual sympathy for the pubescent perspective. She seems less assured when it comes to the supernatural aspects, and the climactic chase and battle feel rushed and perfunctory. But her earnest, moody approach to the material may be just the thing for the 14-year-old girl in all of us. That Edward, hes dreamy.</p>]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Horror]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[<p><i>New Moon</i> gets right to the pulsing heart of the matter with an extended reference to <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>,
a play that Bella (Stewart) and Edward (Pattinson) are reading for
English class. Edward, of course, can quote Romeos final death
soliloquy from memory (the advantages of repeating high school over and
over, one supposes). And like <i>R&amp;J</i>, this film revels in
the spectacular excesses of emotion that teens feel with such earnest
intensity. When Edward leaves Forks and Bella forever (yeah, right),
she grieves so deeply and for so long that you could truly believe she
might die of it. Her only solace is writing unanswered emails to
psychic vamp Alice (Greene) in hopes that Alice will somehow pick up on
it. A lot of e-mails. Seriously. The device really begins to grate
after Stewart drones through five or six of these cris de coeur.</p><p>While
taking a risky ride on a strangers motorcycle (dont try this at home,
kids!), Bella discovers that in times of danger, Edward appears to her
as a ghostly vision, like Obi-Wan Vampire, whispering advice like Be
careful. Thanks, ghostly Edward. Bella becomes a thrill junkie in
hopes of seeing Edward again. That leads her to rebuild a couple of
motorcycles with Jacob (Lautner), though he does the actual work while
she sits around looking mopey and occasionally noting how incredibly
buff Jacob has become.</p><p>And boy has he. One of the nice additions
Weitz brings, assisted by Melissa Rosenbergs script, is some little
jokes about Jacobs beefy physique and his more, shall we say, physical
version of love, which makes Edwards protestations of inner fire seem
lukewarm. In fact, Edward is offscreen for a good long chunk of this
bridging middle chapter of the saga, leaving us to a lot of scenes of
Bella looking sadly out the window, waking up screaming from nightmares
and generally being the ultimate mopey teen.</p><p>Weitz is a smooth
technician, but his direction doesnt quite match the operatic
intensity of Bellas mood, which begins to feel a bit monotonous even
with a steady stream of crazy plot elements like murdered hikers,
Jacobs realization of his werewolf nature and the return of the evil
Victoria (Rachelle Lefevre) bent on revenge. The film perks up a bit
when Michael Sheen camps it up as one of the Volturi, a family of, as
Edward explains, vampire royalty. But this interlude, though more
energetic, feels as if its come from a different movie. After getting
used to Edwards <i>GQ</i> wardrobe and fashionably disheveled hair as the signifiers of vamp-hood, all the red velvet and Euro-accents seem like camp.</p><p>The
core audience for this film will get what it wantsteen love elevated
to the level of epic passion, done with a heavy emphasis on chastity.
Edward does kiss Bella a few times in <i>New Moon</i> (on the
lips!), and even poor horndog (or is that hornwolf?) Jacob almost gets
some lip action, but the film is really about passion unconsummated. In
that, it makes <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, with its clear suggestion that the young protagonists enjoy the pleasures of sex, seem downright dirty.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Larry Cohen's demons have never been your average little devils: Q the Winged Serpent lived atop the Chrysler Building, his anti-Christ lived in a Brooklyn basement, and J Edgar Hoover wasn't exactly human. This one is a white glop which comes bubbling out of the ground, tastes nice, and is immediately mined and marketed by a fast food chain under the logo 'Enough is never enough'. In other words, the monster doesn't come after you, you have to go out and consume it. Once eaten, it does strange things to people. Leading the anti-Stuff campaign for the forces of good is Michael Moriarty, in his customary persona as the laid back bozo who isn't as stupid as he looks ('Nobody is as stupid as I look'). As usual, Cohen's humour is chaotic (importing a right wing private army for the finale), surreal, and very, very subversive. If the drive-in crowd took its message to heart, they'd never eat again. <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i> for our time. CPea.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>In 1963, Andrew Sarris polemically declared <i>Lola Monts</i> the greatest film ever made; today, hes liable to say that his favorite film is a three-way tie among <i>The Rules of the Game</i>, <i>Ugetsu</i> and Ophlss own <i>Earrings of Madame de</i>. His apparent preference for the latter over <i>Lola</i> makes sense: Ophlss best films match the elegance of his design to their materialthe flowing camera becomes emblematic of the whirl of passion, the passing of time, the distance between characters whom the story has contrived to separate.</p><p><i>Lola Monts</i>, on the other hand, is a textbook demonstration of form overwhelming content: To watch it is to marvel at the sensational dolly shots, the florid colors, the stylish flashback structure (its framed as the title characters circus act) and the very wide screen, now restored to its intended 2.55: 1 girth. Coupled with Carols performancethe actress shows all the personality of an illuminated manuscriptthe technique supersizes the narrative into oblivion. That may be the point: As the social-climbing lover of Franz Liszt and Bavarias Ludwig I, among others, Lola is ultimately portrayed as the embodiment of pure spectacle, like the piano-playing elephant to whom the ringmaster (Ustinov) compares her. Sarris recently suggested that Sarah Palin is our modern Lola Monts, but thats insulting to poor Lola, who was at least smart enough to learn a routine.</p>]]></review>

Losey's first bid for success as a 'prestige' director now looks embarrassingly contrived: an allegory on class conflict (derived from Robin Maugham's novel) in which Bogarde's crafty manservant achieves a sinister, game-playing role-reversal in the home of his wealthy, decadent, upper class master (Fox). Neither Pinter's pregnant dialogue nor the generally svelte performances can disguise the fact that there's less here than meets the eye and ear.]]></review>

Degree of difficulty apart - and difficulty involved making an entire farmyard of real animals talk - the merits of <i>Babe </i>are those of Dick King-Smith's classic, <i>The Sheep-Pig</i>. Piglet Babe beats the slaughterhouse and is adopted by a sheepdog who coaches him in the art of rounding up sheep. Taciturn farmer Hoggett (Cromwell) wonderingly goes along with this apprenticeship, and is gratified when Babe wins the rosette at the trials. Babe's secret is politeness which gets better results than barking, and raises lots of laughs. Charming, eccentric and very amusing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Blurring the line between heightened reality and hi-tech fantasy, this presents the virtual world that hackers imagine, rather than the one they inhabit. Busted seven years earlier for causing computer chaos on Wall Street, the legendary 'Zero Cool' (Miller) is now 18 and hooked up with a wacky, multi-ethnic gang of hackers and phone phreaks. While Zero and spiky femme 'Acid Burn' (Jolie) channel their sexual attraction into competing for the top hacker slot, 'Cereal Killer', 'Phantom Freak' and 'Crash Override' define their place in the rebel tribe by pulling harmless on-line stunts. But things get serious when the Secret Service cracks down and 'The Plague' (Stevens), hacker turned security expert, sets them up to take the fall for his internal scam, siphoning millions of dollars from the mega-corporation that employs him to keep them out. Directed with verve, and driven forward by a wrap-around electronic score, this brilliantly captures the energy and insolence of virtual teen rebellion. The sappy ending's hard to take, but the on-line showdown between The Plague, the Secret Service and the united worldwide community of hackers is nail-biting.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>At Hogwarts in year six, a young wizards thoughts turn to the hot
chick in Incantations class, and the potions most of interest are love
potions. While Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) skulks around moodily looking
strangely like David Bowie in the Thin White Duke era, Harry
(Radcliffe), Hermione (Watson) and Ron (Grint) spend an inordinate
percentage of <i>Half-Blood Prince</i> obsessing about whos snogging whom. </p><p>Yes,
theres that whole Voldemort problem to deal with, and certainly people
are disappearing mysteriously while Dumbledore (Gambon) rumbles darkly
but unhelpfully about the dark secrets of Tom Riddle, the boy who would
become Ultimate Evil. But the teen leads engage in the rather thin
plotting only intermittently, and screenwriter Steve Kloves happily
follows their lead.</p><p>For Potter-ites, there are plenty of
satisfactions to be had, but the fun mostly comes from recognizing plot
points from the novel merely suggested onscreen. When Harry finally
gets engaged in some action, the climax is suitably exciting and dark,
but it feels oddly tacked on after two-plus hours spent mostly in the
world of high-school romantic intrigues.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Read our interview with Considine here<br /></i><br />Shane Meadows and his actor friend Paddy Considine have been making cheap short films based on improvised characters such as Considines Le Donk  a self-obsessed roadie-turned-manager with a sinister edge  for years. But this is the first time theyve spun a near-feature-length  but still low, low budget  effort from their between-film doodlings and its an endearing effort with enough heart to fill the gaps where the gags dry up or fall flat. They shot the whole thing in just five days around a real Arctic Monkeys gig at Old Trafford, where Le Donk takes his charge  real-life rapper Scor-Zay-Zee  to perform in a support slot and tries to hog the gig himself. Meadows directs in faux-doc mode and appears as himself, while Considine continues the volatile, vulnerable act  part macho man, part male loser  that drove his performances in A Room for Romeo Brass and Dead Mans Shoes. When Considine really gets going, hes as funny as hes ever been.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Funny things, dreams. Fascinating for the dreamer, but as dull as a late morning in Slough for anybody else, unless, of course, your guide is Freud. Or, as it turns out, Christopher Nolan, the 39-year-old British director of Memento and The Dark Knight, whose solution to the boredom of other peoples dreams is to collide their woozy, ever-changing, upside-down and roundabout nature with the thrust of a fast-paced, men-on-a-mission movie and a startling visual language that mirrors their strangeness. Better still, the dreams preferred by Nolan include images of Paris folding in on itself and a trackless train thundering through a city. The limited, sleepworld excitements of retaking your A levels ad infinitum or forever missing a flight at the airport dont figure here.<br />Nolan throws a perfect storm of stunts, effects, locations and actors at one big idea: that its possible to pilfer ideas from dreams by a process called extraction, which involves hooking yourself up to a drip, falling asleep and entering the world of the subconscious. The holy grail of this process is to reverse it, which is inception, the planting of a new idea in anothers mind. Thats the trick that experts Dom (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt), aided by new recruits Ariadne (Ellen Page) and Eames (Tom Hardy), try to pull off while hopping from Tokyo to Paris to Mombasa. Theyre working for Saito (Ken Watanabe) in pursuit of business magnate Robert (Cillian Murphy), and their motives vary, from financial to intellectual. But DiCaprio has another driver: the memory of his wife Mal (Marion Cottilard) is haunting him and its going to take a lot of psychological spring-cleaning for him to reconnect with that lost world.<br />All hail Nolan for mastering a higher class of mass entertainment. Like all good science fiction, Inception demands we pay serious attention to pure fantasy on the back of strong ideas and exquisite craft  but it also combines fantasy with real observations about our sleeping lives. Like a dream, Nolans film fades swiftly in the light  but while it lasts, it feels like theres nothing more important to decipher.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A work of masterly daring and skill, the new Italian film I Am Love plays out in the late 1990s within a super-rich family called the Recchis. Their power base is a Milanese villa introduced to us by young director Luca Guadagnino as a gilded cage  a marble-and-stone palace too large and ornate to support intimate family life. In the films early scenes Guadagnino laps up this mansion, exploring it with a swirling, fluid camera that turns its world into a character itself. The fictional Recchis recall the Agnellis, another troubled industrialist family which feathered its nest on the back of fascism, but they trade in textiles, not cars, and Guadagnino gives us a brief shot of their mechanised looms at work to stress how business is woven into the fabric of this familys soul.<br />We meet the Recchis on the cusp of change  and change is the films main interest, along with the dangerous strength necessary for any woman to counter the forces of tradition and expectation in such a family. We begin by watching the elderly family head (Gabriele Ferzetti) at dinner as he nominates his successors in a scene of King Lear-like power and unnaturalness. But soon he is dead and our focus and heroine becomes Emma Recchi (Tilda Swinton), the dutiful Russian wife of Tancredi (Pippo Delbono), the familys new head, and mother to two grown-up sons and a daughter attempting her own flight from this patriarchal world. Emmas burgeoning friendship with her sons business partner, Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini), a rural chef, is the nudge that will bring this house of cards down in dramatic, tragic fashion. <br />The story is bold enough, but true daring is at play in the films style. Guadagnino has the confidence to mix big, brash Dallas-style establishing shots of Milan and London and complicated scenes of busy parties with much more intimate, expressive moments. Dialogue becomes less important as the film progresses, and Guadagnino invites us to read the film rather than the characters lips. He also manages to bring the film to an operatic crescendo without losing sight of emotional realities.<br />There are many reasons to recommend this sensual and good-looking film about personal and female liberation. The music is one; it is central to a work that demands that all the films elements work together to create a total cinema. Guadagnino and his star and co-producer, Swinton, persuaded John Adams, the composer of operas such as Nixon in China and Doctor Atomic, to allow his work to be used in a film for the first time and his crashing, arresting, impulsive music is gripping from the start.<br />Its a fitting collaboration. Adams has given modern opera a much-needed shot in the arm and thats what Swinton (who speaks Italian throughout) and Guadagnino are striving to achieve: I Am Love is a brazen blueprint for a cinema that straddles past and future while worrying little about trends of the present. Its a bold experiment rooted in tradition. It plays like smart opera and looks like a marriage of poetic documentary with classical European drama. Swinton and Guadagnino call it Visconti on acid and thats as good a phrase as any to describe the films intoxicating allure.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its 1959, West Texas: the sun is beating down and the sheriffs deputy, Lou Ford (Casey Affleck), is padding the quiet, widescreen streets of smalltown Central City like a model law enforcer, courteous and polite to the passing citizenry and neat in his blouson, tie and  the Southerners sacred badge of down-home decency  kidskin boots and wide-brim Stetson. But, hes walking through Jim Thompson country  the dissembling, rotten home ground of the nihilistic pulp novelist from whose shocking 1952 novel Michael Winterbottom has fashioned his first American movie  and nothing is as it first appears.<br /><br />The sarcastic faux banalities Lou offers people he meets, for his own light amusement, may betray a more complicated mind than the handsome young detective likes to make plain. Hes also shouldering a tragic past involving a lost brother-in-law which in-the-know locals (including union man Elias Koteas), the city fathers (including Ned Beatty), his secret long-term girlfriend Amy (Kate Hudson) and fellow police colleagues (including Tom Bowers sheriff) happily connive in keeping buried. But few realise that the man is a walking timebomb. However, the day soon comes when hes sent to chase off a local prostitute, the beautiful and fiery Joyce (Jessica Alba), and receives the slap that is to trigger in him an explosion of unexpected passion, intricate deceit and murderous self-destruction<br /><br />The film arrives on screens heralded by some box-office-boosting bad publicity, with shockwaves emanating from some who have witnessed the films face-pulverising, hard-to-stomach bouts of violence. Yet this again-atypical film from Winterbottom, the genre-swapping director of A Mighty Heart, Genova and The Road to Guantanamo, is a much more sober affair than its early, controversial press might suggest. <br />Faithful  awfully  to Thompsons devils-rsum-style source text and despairing worldview, it also occupies an emotional space of unnerving calm. The unfussy, if lazily expressive, cinematography (by Winterbottom regular Marcel Zyskind) of familiar 50s Americana, the unobtrusive set design of jail, courthouse and Texan home, and the relaxed, cowpoke-paced editing are all in concert with it. Together they produce a dirge-like accompaniment to a hypnotic and remarkable central performance by Affleck. <br />With his other Ford (movie-stealing coward Robert in Andrew Dominiks retro-western The Assassination of Jesse James) and his terrific turn as the Boston cop in his older brothers underrated Gone Baby Gone, the younger Affleck is arguably becoming the most compulsively watchable American actor of his generation. Hes capable of saving a pretentious film (The Assassination), giving a spine to a potentially diffuse one (Gone Baby Gone) and, as here, giving a sense of mystery and plaintive spirituality to a movie that would otherwise seem underpowered and uncertain of its own moral purpose or profundity. There are other good performances to enjoy  notably from Koteas and Alba  but its Affleck who justifies the price of your ticket.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[If M Night Shyamalans po-faced fantasy epic were half as much fun as its ridiculous title suggests, it might have been possible to salvage a smidgen of entertainment from it. Instead, one is bored and stupefied by what seems like an eternity of vacuous spectacle, cod-Buddhist tosh and clunking dialogue. Even more embarrassing than the risible Lady in the Water, this wildly misjudged farrago is portentous but never profound, laughable but not remotely funny and action-packed without ever being exciting  all in fuzzy, retro-fitted 3D. <br />Having been awol for 100 years  during which time the world was thrown out of balance (yawn) and the bellicose Fire Nation conquered the peaceful Southern Water Tribe with their fearsome war machines  the shaven-headed Aang (Noah Ringer) is released from a sphere of ice by two Water Tribe children, Katara (Nicola Peltz) and her older brother Sokka (Jackson Rathbone). It looks like Aang may be the mythical Avatar, the only being who can control all four elements: Earth, Fire, Water and Air. Various interested parties, including the Fire Nations vengeful, exiled Prince Zuko (Dev Patel), are determined to harness or suppress the Avatars powers. <br />A series of confusing adventures, explosive battles and vaguely spiritual confrontations follows, while giant furry creatures float in the air, talking dragon spirits offer sage advice, and the moon turns red with shame. Devotees of the original Nickleodeon animated TV series swear this film adaptation is a travesty of its meaningful, allegorical themes  but most of them were aged between six and 12 when they first saw it. Either way, if your actual or mental age exceeds this, steer well clear.]]></review>

Perseus (Hamlin) and Andromeda (Bowker) are as boringly lovely as classical hero/ines should be, and even the scaly Kraken looks too dazed to bite Bowker in half.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[French director Claire Deniss marvellous latest feature is a portrait of the close relationship between widowed Parisian train driver Lionel (Alex Descas) and his affectionate student daughter, Josphine (Mati Diop). Critics have welcomed it as both her warmest movie and, with its quiet observation of small ritual, her most affirmative and Ozu-esque. But though its true that 35 Shots demonstrates an extraordinary reflective ease and contains possibly more hugs and smiles than Deniss entire oeuvre to date, that is not to say it is a film free of tribulations, tensions and taboos.<br />The story is simple, a collection of scenes from the life of this small family who live in a flat in the Rue de la Guadeloupe, a little nest where Lionel escapes from the loneliness of his cab and the memory of his losses, and from which Josphine, inhibited from fullly developing her relationships with her neighbours, surrogate mother Gabrielle (Nicole Dogue) and suitor No (Grgoire Colin), must soon fly.<br /><br />From this, Denis magically evokes a liberal meditation on family, harmony, loyalty and belonging and their corollaries  loss, transgression, loneliness and separation  and achieves a sweet unity, not least through a beautifully discreet use of symbols, motifs and metaphors. Thus as cinematographer Agns Godards artful visual correspondences (an RER train and a block of flats shot at night) deepen an understanding of social context, the films various vehicles  Lionels train thundering into north Paris, his motorbike, the bicycle blocking the hallway  suggest not only specifics of occupation or class, but also journeys of different speeds. The films extraordinary economy is typified by a lovely, spontaneous caf scene where the principles dance to the Commodores Nightshift, a mini-ballet touchingly evocative of their separate feelings, relationships and destinies.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Following a welcome return to his bug-eyed heyday in Bad Lieutenant, Nicolas Cage again goes for the big-bucks jackpot of the family movie with The Sorcerers Apprentice, reuniting with National Treasure director Jon Turteltaub for a breezily entertaining but forgettable magical romp. Cage plays Balthazar Blake, a mage locked in a long war of wills with sleazy, power-hungry warlock Horvath (Alfred Molina), until the appearance of bumbling student physicist and natural magician Dave (Jay Baruchel) threatens to tip the balance. Cue training montages, wacky mop-based mishaps and deafening plasma-bolt battles on New Yorks streets. <br />With Cage playing it relatively straight and serious, the show is stolen by moustache-twirling Molina and his David Copperfield-inspired acolyte Drake, essayed with oily glee by Toby Kebbell. But with Baruchels likeable lead turn hamstrung by a disastrous romantic subplot, some distinctly non-special effects and a script loaded with blunt expository dialogue, the film casts a superficial and short-lived spell.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Wonderful satire on small-town jingoism, all the more remarkable in that it was made during World War II. Bracken is the scrawny Marine, son of a World War I hero, instantly invalided out because of hay fever. Terrified at this mortal blow to family pride, he hides out as a shipyard worker while pretending to be overseas, until forcibly escorted home by six sympathetic Marines who learn his story. But a quirk of the telephone wires has translated 'hay' into 'jungle' fever, and to his horror he finds a civic welcome awaiting him as a Pacific war hero, with worse to come when he is adopted by acclaim as candidate for mayor. The ending has been taxed with sentimentality, although it is in fact deeply ironic. Otherwise no Middle American sacred cow (from mom and apple pie to heroic fathers) is spared in this hilarious blend of satire, slapstick and comedy of manners, with marvellous dialogue full of dizzy non-sequiturs and an amazing gallery of grotesque characters.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[That critics hailed Truffaut's film about children as 'delightful' and 'enchanting' is a fair indication of its gross sentimentality. An initial sequence showing pupils arriving for school in a small French provincial town serves as the linking device for a series of unrelated episodes involving individual children and their families, ranging from the inconsequential to the downright mawkish. There's not a snotty nose in sight, just endless well-scrubbed faces into whose mouths Truffaut frequently puts lines of quite nauseating cuteness: 'Gregory went BOOM!' burbles the toddler who has fallen - unscathed, alas - from a ninth floor window. And most winsome of all is Julien (Goldmann), the doe-eyed welfare case whom a school medical reveals to have been beaten up by his parents: presumably this film's intended audience would have difficulty feeling sorry for an <i>unattractive</i> child.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>You immediately like the quiet Christophe (Zem), a bodyguard in
Fontaines lighthearted legal thriller, because he seems immune to the
bullshit that inevitably comes with a Monaco movie. He turns up
unexpectedlya silent watcheras our trial-lawyer hero, Bertrand
(Luchini), is chatting up a beautiful stranger. Interrupted, Bertrand
learns that due to the nature of his high-profile murder case, his
client wants him guarded around the clock. Protector and protectee soon
bond through the awkwardness; you brace yourself for worst-case
scenarios.</p><p>How wondrous, then, that the threat comes in a cloud
of blond hair. This is only Bourgoins first film, but as Audrey, a
weather reporter and force of nature herself, shes landed a role of
unusual charm and complexity. Her character is not merely a flirt, but
a larky spirit of her age, chained to a video camera, who dreams of
hosting a show about celebrity pets. Audrey has a sexual past with the
disapproving Christophe and attaches herself to the flattered
lawyerand because this is a gambling town, you expect a scam. Sweetly,
though, the con is love, born in her red bedroom under the Princess
Diana photo. <i>The Girl from Monaco</i> is not <i>To Die For</i>, but for long stretches, its just as unpredictable. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[From the opening sequence, in which a circle of laughing children poke at a scorpion writhing in a sea of ants, to the infamous blood-spurting finale, Peckinpah completely rewrites John Ford's Western mythology - by looking at the passing of the Old West from the point of view of the marginalised outlaws rather than the law-abiding settlers. Though he spares us none of the callousness and brutality of Holden and his gang, Peckinpah nevertheless presents their macho code of loyalty as a positive value in a world increasingly dominated by corrupt railroad magnates and their mercenary killers (Holden's old buddy Ryan). The flight into Mexico, where they virtually embrace their death at the hands of double-crossing general Fernandez and his rabble army, is a nihilistic acknowledgment of the men's anachronistic status. In purely cinematic terms, the film is a savagely beautiful spectacle, Lucien Ballard's superb cinematography complementing Peckinpah's darkly elegiac vision.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Tarantino's powerful homage/reworking of the heist-gone-wrong thriller - stealing ideas from Kubrick's <i>The Killing</i> and Scorsese's <i>Mean Streets</i>, among others - is probably the final word (or frame) on the subject. A bunch of colour-coded crooks (Mr White, Mr Pink, etc), previously unknown to each other, chosen and named by ageing <i>capo</i> Joe Cabot (Tierney) and his son Nice Guy Eddie (Penn), execute a jewellery robbery. The job done, the getaway fucked up, they reassemble at a warehouse to get what's coming to them. Tarantino engineers their demise from the interaction of their character flaws - there is certainly no honour among these talkative thieves - with the inexorable logic of a chess grandmaster. Despite the clockwork theatrical dynamics - most of the action is restricted to the warehouse - the film packs a massive punch. It's violent, intelligent, well written (by Tarantino) and acted (Buscemi, Roth and Penn take the prizes). A <i>tour de force</i>.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[John Nada (Piper) is grouchy because ever since he arrived in Los Angeles from Colorado, there's been nothing but trouble. People are rude, he lives on a campsite, and then the place is demolished by the cops. Things get worse when he happens across a hidden stash of special sunglasses. Donning a pair, his vision is literally reduced to black-and-white, revealing a terrible plot being perpetrated on the underclass. Skeletal aliens have invaded earth, taking on human guise, hogging the best jobs, and placing subliminal messages on hoardings and magazines which instruct the man on the street to 'Obey', 'Submit', 'Marry and Reproduce'. It's sunglasses for all as Nada and his pal Frank (David) attempt to infiltrate the media and expose the conspiracy. The black-and-white visuals disturb for only so long, and while themes of indoctrination and conspiracy prove initially intriguing, the film quickly descends into fistfights and gunfire. Still, there's little about the comic strip action to suggest that we should be taking this too seriously.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Read our interview with the director of Coco Before Chanel here</i><br />Before Chanel, Coco was a dirt-poor child abandoned at an orphanage: hardly original territory for a biopic. But if it hadnt been for her tough early life  itinerant father, years in care, brief early career as a tavern singer  she might never have had the gumption to found an iconoclastic fashion house. Coco wasnt always Chanel, but she was never ordinary. <br />Anne Fontaines film has two interests: clothes and Audrey Tautou. The outfits are purposefully terrible: Cocos early homemade monstrosities may have been original, but they didnt have much else over the corseted excesses of the Edwardian era. But Tautou is wonderful  a black-eyed urchin so sullen and furious you forget how beautiful she is until she smiles. Not that she has a great deal to smile about, trapped in poverty and in Paris with no idea what to make of her life. <br />Attempting to flee the restrictions she was born with, she turns up on a rich but boorish lovers doorstep and starts cutting down mens clothes. These are the keys to her personality, and director Anne Fontaine handles them with respect. It must have been tempting to make the clothes prettier and the lover, Belsan (Benot Poelvoorde), more chivalrous, but that kind of compromise would hardly have been true to the spirit of a heroine who was never one for seeing anyone elses viewpoint, much less accommodating it. Belsan treats her abominably, but he also introduces her to the high life and to handsome Arthur Boy Capel (Alessandro Nivola): its hard to say which she takes to more. <br />Fontaines film is gorgeous, but its beauty is practical, almost textile, like a Chanel tweed.  It has its own excesses: if Boy had been the hero we see here, hed have snorted at convention and married her. But, Chanel, an inveterate fantasist who fabricated her origins as assiduously as her suits, would have preferred this version. Only a late flashback, before the glamorous finale, is unworthy  Tautou, her heavy-browed little face a-glimmer with memory, simply doesnt require its help.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The concept probably looked promising on paper: create a computer-generated 3D environment and insert a rabble of characters inspired by the two-dimensional cartoons of yesteryear  a sort of retro, low-fi CGI, if you like. So what went wrong? Well, for starters, youd need to scour the bowels of the Cartoon Network to find a less appealing bunch than these four unlikely New York zoo companions  a lion, a zebra, a giraffe and a hippo  who agree that the grass looks greener on the other side and promptly abscond, only to wash up, shipwrecked, on a Madagascan beach, where their survival instincts are put to the test. Alex the lion, meanwhile, starts having dangerous hallucinations about juicy steaks while staring at Marty the zebras rump.Wheres it headed? Nowhere, since the whole enterprise runs aground thanks to an unfunny, schtick-laden script, clichd film references, an ensemble of mostly irritating voiceovers (by Ben Stiller, Chris Rock et al) and an unsatisfactory denouement that suggests DreamWorks animation team lost all sense of direction and, possibly, the will to see it through. Boring and bedraggled.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Intelligent and chic, this account of Coco Chanels brief affair with the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky picks up where Coco Before Chanel left off: in 1920. Before that, it opens electrifyingly in 1913 with the near-riot at the premiere of The Rite of Spring. Coco is in the audience as jeers and boos greet Nijinskys dancers stomping out Stravinskys brutal, atonal score. Stravinsky (Mads Mikkelsen) storms out of the theatre.<br />Anna Mouglalis makes for an icier Coco than Audrey Tautou, hardened by the death in 1919 of Boy Capel, the love of her life. When their paths cross in 1920, Stravinsky is penniless in Paris. Chanel invites him and his family to stay at her chic villa. Its an obvious come on, and the two circle each other: Igor proud and egotistical, Coco arrogant and egotistical. Still, in the end you cant help thinking this brief love affair was just that  intense maybe, but of no huge significance to either of them. More involving are Chanels encounters with Stravinskys wife, who is bedridden with tuberculosis but knows what her husband is up to. Coco presents her with a bottle of Chanel No 5  an act of calculated cruelty. But Mrs S is no pushover, and her plain-spoken words to Coco about the effect of marriage on love might explain why Miss Chanel remained a mademoiselle.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This has the hallmarks of a Billy Wilder picture - Americans abroad, masquerades leading to moral transformation - and Wilder would doubtless have turned it into a blazing masterpiece. Wyler's style was not particularly suited to comedy - the film is a little long, a little heavy at times, the spontaneity a little over-rehearsed - and he simply makes a wonderfully enjoyable movie. Hepburn is the Princess bored with protocol who goes AWOL in Rome; Peck (Holden would have been better, edgier) is the American journalist who has the scoop fall into his lap; and Albert (the best performance) is the photographer who has to snap all of Hepburn's un-royal escapades. This sort of thing was churned out by Lubitsch in the '30s, on the Paramount back-lot; Wyler went on location, and in 1953 that was a real eye-opener, Hollywood's answer to neo-realism. The movie remains a great tonic.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This is the sequel that John McTiernan and Arnold Schwarzeneggers 1987 original deserved, as director Nimrod Antal delivers enough hard core sci-fi, explosive action and monster mayhem to justify its belated arrival. Forget the official sequel and the lame Alien vs Predator spin-offs, this Predator sequel deserves one of its own. Armed to the teeth but unknown to one another, a multiracial group of military/criminal killers (plus Topher Graces anomalous wimpy doctor) find themselves on a Predator hunting planet where they are the game. Faced with an evolved generation of super-Predators, Adrien Brodys Hemingway-quoting, self-appointed leader (There is no hunting like the hunting of men . . . ) insists that their survival depends upon pooling their own killer instincts. Alice Bragas svelte sniper is a tough yet tender foil for the buff, brainy Brody; with one notable exception, the remaining dirty half-dozen are merely disposable. Channelling Brandos unhinged Colonel Kurtz, a well-padded Laurence Fishburne pops up halfway through as a surprise sole survivor, a striking cameo that nods to his youthful debut in Apocalypse Now.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p><i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> creator Bill Watterson might appreciate
the spectacle of William H. Macy going head-to-head with a giant living
booger, considering the frequent references to nasal expectoration in
his seminal comic strip. That isnt to say that Rodriguezs
funny-pages-like fantasy film comes within loogie-hocking distance of <i>C&amp;H</i>s insight and achievement.</p><p>Preteen
brace face Toe Thompson (Bennett) narrates the tale of a
rainbow-colored wishing rock that falls from the sky into his Austin
neighborhood. The joke is that hes so uncertain as to which events
came first that he has to tell the story via a series of
chronologically scrambled short films. For anyone familiar with
Rodriguezs trademark ADD stylings, this seems like a particularly
up-front metaconfession. Whether hes doing <i>Sin City</i> or <i>Spy Kids</i>,
the writer-director-composer-producer-cinematographer-etc. always
infantilizes his audience, jolting our synapses and indulging our
slavering desires for goop and gore.</p><p>Yet his movies dont lack for a personal stamp, which at times makes their often shoddy construction defensible. In <i>Shorts</i>,
theres a pleasantly home-grown aspect to the weightless digital
effects, the canted angles and the amateurish performances. The effort
is certainly more appreciable than the execution, but props should be
given to Rodriguezs breathless lets put on a show inventiveness.
Plus, Macy and the boogerkick ass!</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Toning down, though not entirely ditching, the swathes of rough S&amp;M sex that featured in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo  the first movie to be made from Stieg Larssons trilogy  this sequel nevertheless drags us back into a world of breadknife-to-the-scrote feminism where sexual violence seldom goes without punishment. And again, its worth the price of admission alone to spend time in the company of Swedens premiere bisexual emo-sleuth, Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), as she gets tangled up in a hackneyed and unlikely plot where she must work out who has framed her for the murder of a journalist on the cusp of exposing a sex-trafficking ring.<br /><br />The title refers to an incident from Lisbeths childhood when she doused her abusive father in petrol and set him ablaze  an event, it transpires, whose consequences she must now face. <br />Offering less of a cut-and-dried storyline than the first instalment, this film spends its running time carefully arranging the narrative dominoes in order to  hopefully  have them topple in the third and final film (due in November). The only real advantage of seeing Dragon Tattoo first is that it gives depth and meaning to Lisbeths relationship with ruddy-faced reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), who works tirelessly to clear the name of his erstwhile paramour. Filmed in murky, grainy tones which chime nicely with the squalid demi-monde that Lisbeth is forced to frequent, the film is more sharply focused on fleshing out mood and character than it is supplying rudimentary twists at cosy junctures. Certainly, much of the story is Google-powered, but is that not to be expected from an ace computer hacker? And the debate regarding the films feminist credentials is rendered moot at the point where Lisbeth takes down a leering Hells Angel with an electric Taser to the trouser area.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[
An underrated film, perhaps because it is less science fiction than a tale of 'once upon a time'. Where Ray Bradbury's novel posited a strange, terrifyingly mechanised society which has banned books in the interests of material well-being, Truffaut presents a cosy world not so very different from our own, with television a universal father-figure pouring out reassuring messages, and the only element of menace a fire-engine tearing down the road. A bright, gleaming childhood red, the engine is like a reminder of toyhood days; and as Werner's fireman hero goes about his task of destroying literature, his growing awareness of the almost human way in which books curl up and die in the flames gradually assumes the dimensions of a quest for a legendary lost treasure - movingly glimpsed as he slowly and painfully deciphers the title-page of <i>David Copperfield.</i> Here the rich, nostalgic pull of the past wins out over technocracy, and the film ends, as it began, with a scene lifted right out of time: a wonderful shot of the rebels - each dedicated to the preservation of a literary masterpiece by committing it to memory - wandering in contented, idyllic exile by the edge of a glitteringly icy lake.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[M Legrand (Simon), a mild-mannered, middle-aged cashier, uses painting as a means of expression, of escape from his shrewish wife and the tedium of his job. After an accidental encounter with <i>femme fatale</i> Lulu (Marze), he falls madly in love, setting her up in a flat which he fills with his paintings. Lulu, who loves only her pimp Dd (Flamant), uses Legrand as a milch-cow, and when his money runs short, starts selling his paintings as her own (with the Sunday painter ironically unaware that his work is now much sought after). Freeing himself finally from his wife, Legrand arrives at the flat, only to realise that Lulu is still bedding Dd... Renoir's first great talkie has been described as 'an insignificant little melodrama, given unexpected vigour and depth by a sense of momentary occasion in the filming'. That is, a glorious experiment in, and exploration of, the nature of cinema. Wonderfully moving, with great performances. Remade by Fritz Lang as <i>Scarlet Street</i>.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Flaherty's last work, like his first, <i>Nanook of the North</i>, was the product of one of those fluke occasions when a sponsor (in this case, the Standard Oil Company) offers money with no strings attached. With no disciplining 'purpose', Flaherty's totally intuitive method was tested to its limits - and his editor Helen van Dongen has recorded the extraordinary convolutions of plot and readings that his material underwent en route to its ravishing conclusion. As an account of oil exploration, Flaherty's narrative may seem slightly naive; but his vision of a child's myth-world, and the oilmen's intrusion and acceptance into it, is perhaps his greatest achievement.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Though many movies dont like to tell you this, real life is messy. People do shitty things with good motives and noble things to feed their egos. Friends go through rough patches that cant be fixed with a quick hug, and lovers sometimes treat each other like crap precisely because they are in love.</p><p>Tchin (<i>The Wild Reeds</i>, <i>Alice and Martin</i>) is drawn toward that kind of messiness in this drama about a circle of friends in the early days of the AIDS crisis. Young, gay Manu (Libreau) forms a tricky friendship with older gay doctor Adrien (Blanc), who has a history of falling for young guys who use him. When Manu develops AIDS, Adrien becomes his caregiver, a role that gives him control over the object of his semi-requited love. Adriens friend Sarah (Bart) is a wonderful childrens author but a terrible mother. Her husband, Mehdi (Bouajila), likes sex with guys but works as a vice cop cracking down on gay cruising.</p><p>For those who remember the mid-1980s, Tchins mix of nostalgia and righteous anger will feel exactly right. For those who dont, this is a moving look at the way the world changed in just a few years.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[I hope your kids have bad influences and develop bad personalities, says the well-to-do dad of three suburban young adults as a putdown in the mysterious, bold Dogtooth, hinting at a unique approach to parenting of which Josef Fritzl would be proud. Director Giorgos Lanthimos gives us a middle-class Greek family, lorded over by a businessman father who keeps his three children within the walls of their smart home and teaches them the incorrect definitions of several new words each day (A motorway is a very strong wind). These kids world is without outside interference: when their mother talks on the phone, they think shes speaking to herself; when planes fly over, they think theyre toys. Perhaps the dads biggest mistake is to allow a security guard from work to enter their home and sexually satisfy his son. He doesnt bargain on her trading gifts and ideas with his daughter for sexual favours. Nor does he pre-empt the danger of her lending his daughter videos of Rocky and Flashdance.<br />With hints of Hanekes The Seventh Continent, Ian McEwans The Cement Garden and even Lord of the Flies, Lanthimos has crafted a stunningly provocative and at times witty play on the inspirations that make us who we are. All families live by their own rules, and this drama takes that idea to its perverse and shocking conclusion. Lanthimos films these calamities in a quiet, observational style, with calm colours, subtle camera movements and gentle edits, lending an air of normality to a world that couldnt be less so. Special and troubling.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Bogart plays a cold-hearted tycoon whose sole companion in life is <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. Holden is his wastrel brother, and Hepburn the chauffeur's daughter. Yes, you've guessed what happens. Holden fools around with her, she attempts suicide, is sent to France for a cookery course, returns to melt Bogart's heart, and Holden is left to chair the board. Getting to this characteristic Wilder reversal of roles is romantic, funny and astringent all at the same time. Bogart is the man of plastic - he doesn't burn, melt or scorch - and Wilder satirises him and his ideals ruthlessly. Bogart's age here is crucial: he looks like an undertaker who has sidestepped the youth which Hepburn will give him. The golden boy Holden is the other extreme and equally ridiculous, driving around in his snazzy cars, coerced into a marriage between corporations, and forced to sit on some champagne glasses, enabling Bogart to sort out the Hepburn problem. It's a Cinderella story that gets turned on its head, a satire about breaking down class and emotional barriers (neatly signified in the array of window and glass imagery), and a confrontation between New World callousness and Old World humanity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Pat Boone gives this colourful, exciting story its few nauseating moments (as when he sings 'My Heart's in the Highlands'). Otherwise it's one of the very best Hollywood adventure movies, with lots of monsters, underground oceans, sinister villains, and touches which would have delighted Jules Verne himself. James Mason as usual carries his part superbly, and there are plenty of good supporting actors like Napier and Ronson. Some of the special effects are intriguing, and believe it or not there's also quite a bit of effective sexual symbolism in typical Hollywood style, which greatly enhances the syrupy romantic subplot. Watch for the ending in which the girl is blown up on a giant funnel, with close-ups of her on her back smiling orgastically.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>American cinemas ongoing obsession with female sex organs and what goes in and is pushed out of them continues with this vapid vagina monologue written and directed by Lichtenstein (son of Roy and best known for his role as the boyfriend in Ang Lees <i>The Wedding Banquet</i>). Dawn (Weixler), an impassioned spokeswoman for her local teenage-abstinence movement, learns that her vajayjay has choppers. A trail of bloody sausages is left in her wakea gag thats funny for about as long as the jokes about Lorena Bobbitt were in 1993.</p><p>Theres something inside me thats lethal, Dawn tells a group of sex-spurning teens. Lichtenstein assumes the role of profeminist provocateur, but his satire is so lazy (how many shots of nuclear towers spewing black smoke are needed?) that any attempt to say something intelligent about the power of adolescent-girl sexuality simply goes down the hole. In the closing credits, special thanks is given to Camille Paglia, in whose university classroom Lichtenstein first heard about the vagina dentata. Even though shes a cultural theorist and not a directorand frequently a crackpotPaglias monograph on <i>The Birds</i> and her deft analysis of the wrath of Mother Nature suggests that she might have been a better helmer. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Older people have sex too! Thats the message of Its Complicated, the second geronto-com from Nancy Meyers. While 2003s Somethings Gotta Give featured an angsty, flustered Diane Keaton and a womanising Jack Nicholson, this stars a slightly less angsty Meryl Streep, who is flustered by her encounter with serial womaniser Alec Baldwin.<br />The complication is that Jane (Streep) was married to Jake (Baldwin)  but he left her and their kids for other woman Agness (Lake Bell). Now Jakes on a nostalgia trip, sweet-talking his independent ex into bed and a whole world of confusion. This may sound like unforgivably caddish behaviour, but script and actor conspire to make Jake an attractive proposition, with Baldwins charismatic arrogance and playful banter in full effect. <br />Baldwin has terrific chemistry with Streep: the pair seem to be having a genuinely hilarious time getting drunk and naked together  not that Jane will do that with the lights on. The script explores female insecurities and doesnt shy away from the realities of middle-aged sex: Jake proudly displays his hairy beer belly on several occasions.<br />You could watch this pair run around having a slapstick secret affair for hours. Unfortunately, Steve Martin has to poke his head in as the Sensible Alternative, and hes miscast. Martin is fine in comic scenes, but as a romantic possibility hes unappealing. The inevitable conflict between the two men takes the film into more humdrum, sentimental territory, not helped by periodic appearances from Janes soppy grown-up children. Still, Streep is as enjoyable as ever, and if laughs count for anything, this is one of the better romantic comedies of the season.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An apparently immutable law of film states that for every action
star, there must be at least one humiliating appearance in a family
comedy featuring adorable moppets, ugly flat lighting and poorly
executed slapstick. Arnold Schwarzenegger: <i>Kindergarten Cop</i>. Vin Diesel: <i>The Pacifier</i>. Dwayne The Rock Johnson: <i>The Game Plan</i>, <i>Tooth Fairy</i>. Add to that list Jackie Chan: <i>The Spy Next Door</i>.<p>Now
in his mid-fifties, Chan can no longer pull off the elaborate stunts
that made him famous, and his comedic mugging for the camera no longer
looks cute. For most of his late-blooming Hollywood career, he was able
to bluff on the martial arts with strategic editing, and his comic
gifts were shown in the best light by pairing him with people like Owen
Wilson (<i>Shanghai Noon</i>) and Chris Tucker (<i>Rush Hour</i>). In <i>Spy Next Door</i>, hes left adrift with a few badly edited fight scenes, and the comic foils are George Lopez and Billy Ray Cyrus.</p><p>Superspy
Bob Ho (Chan) has kept his job a secret from his next-door-neighbor
girlfriend (Amber Valletta, generic) and her three kids (Madeline Carroll, Will Shadley and
Alina Foley, uniformly annoying). While Bob is baby-sitting the kids, a
Russian villain (Magnus Scheving, looking vaguely ashamed, as he should) comes
after Bob, and he has to protect the kids and outsmart the bad guys.
Wed like to hope this film ends Chans mandated action-star
humiliation, but next up hes got a remake of <i>The Karate Kid</i>. Oh well.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This thoroughly modern family portrait, which became the summers sleeper indie hit in the US, is a perfectly balanced combination of comical episodes and subtle gestures, sharp one-liners and effortlessly naturalistic dialogue. Julianne Moore and Annette Bening play a middle-aged couple whose teenage children Joni (Mia Wasikowska from Alice in Wonderland) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson) go looking for the sperm-doner their mums used to get pregnant (Ruffalo). His arrival disrupts the family's lives and sparks each character to contemplate what it means to grow up or grow old. But this isnt just another film where life lessons are learned and they all live happily ever after. Writer-director Lisa Cholodenko (High Art, Laurel Canyon) knows that real life is messier than that, but her empathy and lightness of touch ensure this wonderfully realistic film is both deeply affecting and riotously funny.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Seeing the finished product, you can see why there was such a turnover of directors and writers. There is no story, no motor, and given the nature of the premise, nothing much can happen; so it's lucky that Levinson, a fine observer of human behaviour washing about, was signed to make this increasingly costly dramatic standoff look busy. Hoffman does a self-contained turn, Cruise does Handsome Classes, though people say he's getting better. Charlie Babbitt (Cruise), a two-bit hustler trading cars, learns that Raymond (Hoffman), the brother he's forgotten, is to inherit three million dollars, and zones in to chisel him out of it. Raymond is autistic and institutionalised, but in their time together on the road, Charlie learns Raymond's limitations and windfall gifts - he can memorise numbers - and discovers his own decency. Raymond is a fixed point for Charlie to develop against, and just to amplify that Charlie is a stranger in a strange land, even his girlfriend Susanne (Golino) exists more fully in another language. Basically, it is a two-hander in which one side is stalled and stays stalled, devoid of an overview which might illuminate. Hard to do, though.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A reminder that, once upon a time, Spielberg used to make films for adults rather than infants and critical regressives. Maybe it is just a monster movie reminiscent of all those '50s sci-fi films, but it's at least endowed with intelligent characterisation, a lack of sentimentality (in contrast to, say, <i>E.T.</i>), and it really is frightening. And, added to the Ahab/Moby Dick echoes in the grizzled sailor Shaw's obsession with the Great White Shark, there are moments of true darkness, expressed most eloquently in the John Milius-scripted speech about the wreck of the 'Indianapolis'.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Set in a Thai ghost town still recovering from the regions 2004 tsunami, Aditya Assarats romantic drama plays out its courtship rituals against a ravaged coastal landscape: Deserted residences, empty beaches and gutted buildings haunt every brief encounter. A corporate resort is being constructed in the former vacation destination, and the companys Bangkok-based architect (Kansen) arrives to chart the projects progress. The urban dweller checks into a ramshackle motel owned by a young, mousy woman (Saisoontorn). He flirts with her while she hangs laundry; she sneaks into his room to caress the bedsheets. They drift into a tentative relationship (everything in the film happens at drifting speed), though as it has on their environment, the past has left its scars. And similar to their backwoods American counterparts, these rural locals dont take kindly to strangers in their midst.</p><p>Both the languid pace and fixation on pastoral vistas suggest the directors kinship with fellow countryman Apichatpong Weerasethakul, while the keen attention paid to architecture hints at an Antonioni obsession. The lyrical manner in which <i>Wonderful Town</i> introduces a third-act shift into B-movie territory, however, is Assarats alone; his raw, poetic sensibility turns this posttraumatic parable into something both dreamy and oddly disturbing.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Despite the international acclaim afforded to directors such as Pen-ek Ratanaruang (Last Life in the Universe) and Apichatpong Weerasethakul (this years LFF selection Tropical Malady), Thailand remains underrepresented on the festival circuit, so this old-fashioned musical Bildngsroman is a welcome entry on the LFF slate. The film follows musical prodigy Sorn, who remains dedicated to his xylophone-like ranad through the wages of rivalry, romance, and world war. The result is plodding but warmhearted; the music is enchanting and so is the scenery.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Jaume Balaguer and Paco Plazas adequate but disappointing sequel to their terrifying Spanish horror movie picks up the action just minutes after the final night vision shot of TV presenter Angela (Manuela Velasco) being dragged off into the darkness. A four-man SWAT team enters the quarantined building alongside public health official Dr Owen (Jonathan Mellor), blissfully unaware of the virus-induced mayhem and infected crazies that await them. The audience, however, knows exactly what to expect, so despite a few neat surprises, [Rec] 2 mainly expands on familiar images and ideas.<br /><br />The sequels major innovation is the replacement of the originals single TV camera with the teams multiple-camera set-up. Bloody-faced zombies lunge at the camera, POV shots often resemble those in first-person shooter video games, and screens-within-screens display feeds from other parts of the building. This technology is used cleverly but not very effectively, boosting the amount of information without ramping up the suspense. Theres also a lot of tying up loose ends, which is clever in a puzzle-solving way, but undermines the sense of an anarchic plunge into chaos. <br />More contentiously, the supernatural/ religious element introduced towards the end of the first film is expanded here, pushing the sequel into Exorcist-style territory. Most damagingly, about 40 minutes in, the focus abruptly shifts to three irritating teens who have slipped into the house through the drains. This flabby mid-section only serves to deflate the tension and pad out the modest running time. One could drive a fire engine through the many plot holes, as [Rec] 2 does little more than fan the dying embers of the original.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Lubitsch's last film and one of his most engaging comedies, with Jones and Boyer surprisingly well-teamed as the plumber's niece (later housemaid) and the Czech refugee who throw English society into a tizzy with their disregard for conventions, while simultaneously allowing Lubitsch to take a few digs at well-meaning liberals. The satire, though taking in snobbery upstairs, downstairs and in the middle classes, doesn't exactly bite, but is given a jolly run around by a cast comprising most of Hollywood's British stalwarts from Sir C Aubrey Smith to Sara Allgood and Una O'Connor.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Glenn (Dorff), a Canadian in his early teens, has a thing about rockets, a 16-year-old sister who cares, an HM-loving demonologist buddy, and parents who make untimely decisions to go away for the weekend. As such, this spunky, diminutive Everyman is clearly well equipped to deal with the Forces of Darkness when, for no apparent reason, they come steaming out of a hole in his back garden. After an eventful but soporific first half, the plot, as full of holes as the Albert Hall, takes off into surreal nonsense that is almost delightful: inappropriately cute and beautifully animated SFX monsters thrown up from Hell; a hand stigmatised with a functionless eye; and a dead workman who never existed in the first place arriving zombie-like to wreak revenge for nothing in particular. The lunacy on view is strangely dreamlike, and no bad thing. It's only a pity the film actually tries to make sense. More abandon all round, and the result could have been a Z-grade cult classic.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Arguably Hawks' greatest film, a deceptively rambling chamber Western made in response to the liberal homilies of <i>High Noon</i>. Here the marshal in need of help is Wayne, desperately fending off a clan of villains determined to release the murderer he's holding in jail until the arrival of the state magistrate. Unlike Cooper, however, he rejects rather than courts offers of help, simply because his supporters are either too old (Brennan), too young (Nelson), female (Dickinson) or alcoholic (Martin). Thus the film becomes an examination of various forms of pride, prejudice and professionalism, as the various outcasts slowly cohere through mutual aid to form one of the director's beloved self-contained groups. Little of the film is shot outdoors, with a subsequent increase in claustrophobic tension, while Hawks peppers the generally relaxed and easy narrative - which even takes time out to include a couple of songs for Dino and Ricky - with superb set pieces: Dino's redemptory shooting of a fugitive villain; the explosive finale in which Duke realises he needs all the help he can get. Beautifully acted, wonderfully observed, and scripted with enormous wit and generosity, it's the sort of film, in David Thomson's words, which reveals that 'men are more expressive rolling a cigarette than saving the world'.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When Detroit comic-store assistant Clarence (Slater) and novice whore Alabama (Arquette) meet, not only do they immediately fall in love, but the tone of her voice-over lets us know that we're in for a <i>Badlands</i>-style rerun. Having killed her monstrous pimp (Oldman, OTT) and accidentally stolen his coke haul, the pair head for Hollywood, pausing only to bid farewell to his drunkard dad Clifford (Hopper). But the couple's get-rich-quick plans go awry when suave mob boss Coccotti (Walken) tries to 'persuade' Clifford to divulge his son's whereabouts. If the romance seldom seems 'true', the spiralling violence (script, Quentin Tarantino) does succeed, in a brutish, cod-Jacobean kind of way.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Carla (Devos) does a bit of everything for a property development firm that takes her loyalty and talent for granted, and she does it well. But while the boss agrees to her hiring an assistant - she selects scuzzily good-looking but clueless ex-con Paul (Cassel) - her colleagues mostly treat her like dirt, ridiculing her frumpiness and taking credit for her work. It'd be worse still if they knew she's profoundly deaf, a disadvantage which she finds can be turned to her advantage. If only she and Paul, who has his own tormentors, could sort out their mutual wariness and their very different attitudes to life, they might savour some sweet revenge. Audiard's exquisitely elegant thriller is notable for its fresh, exploratory approach to genre. On one level, it's another bracing French film about the workplace, but filtered through Hitchcockian stylistic and thematic tropes. The plot has more than its share of wit and clever twists, there's insightful stuff involving voyeurism, shifts in power and point of view, and the sexual-romantic side is sensibly understated. And Devos and Cassel are both terrific.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[School's breaking up for the summer of '76. The seniors debate party politics while next term's freshmen run the gauntlet of brutal initiation rites, barely comforted by the knowledge that they'll wield the stick one day. No one's looking much farther ahead than that. This has a free-wheeling, 'day-in-the-life-of' structure which allows writer/director Linklater, in his second feature, to eavesdrop on an ensemble cast without much in the way of dramatic contrivance. There's a quirky counter-cultural intelligence at work: sympathy for those on the sidelines, and a deadpan pop irony which places this among the hippest teenage movies. While the camera flits between some two dozen youngsters (played by uniformly excellent unknowns), Linklater allows himself to develop a handful of stories. Seriously funny, and shorn of any hint of nostalgia or wish-fulfilment, this is pretty much where it's at.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Back from the future in which the machines rule comes a rippling robot (Schwarzenegger) who terminates opponents with extreme prejudice (like ripping their hearts out). His goal is to kill a woman (Hamilton) destined to bear the child who will become the great freedom fighter of the future. Fortunately she has a champion in the shape of another time traveller, Arnold's all-too-human opponent (Biehn). The gladiatorial arena is set, with vulnerable flesh and cunning versus a leviathan who totes around massive weapons like so many chic accessories and can rebuild his organs as they get shot away. The pacing and the action are terrific, revelling in the feral relentlessness which characterised <i>Assault on Precinct 13</i> and <i>Mad Max 2</i>; even the future visions of a wasted LA are well mounted. More than enough violence to make it a profoundly moral film; and Arnold's a whizz. CPea.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The plastic empire of historical dolls created by Pleasant T. Rowland in 1986 and sold to aggressive-marketing toy juggernaut Mattel in 1998 has resulted in this silver-screen infomercial, the first in multiplexes but the fourth in a line of bland product-placement features that debuted on the WB. Like the previous films, which counted Mia Farrow, Marcia Gay Harden and Molly Ringwald among their ranks, <i>Kit Kittredge</i> boasts an eclectic mix of Oscar-caliber actors and colorful B-listers. First among them is Academy Award nominee Abigail Breslin, whose pixie charms are no match for the lifeless civic lesson offered up as a plot.</p><p>As with all the fact-based characters fashioned by American Girl, Kit lives during a specific era that challenges her with a social injustice: in this case the Depression and the resultant homeless who are unfairly accused of causing a hobo crime spree on the streets of Cincinnati. Kit herself tastes economic desperation when her family is forced to take in boarders for money, and turns Nancy Drew on some surprising suspects when valuables go missing. By all means, teach our children about Americas storied past, but dont use history to put lipstick on a narrative pig bred for selling bacon.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p><i>Hotel for Dogs</i> is the story of a couple of orphaned kids who take in stray pups and make a home for them in an abandoned New York hotel. You see, the kids feel a kinship with these cast-off mutts because they, too, have no one to look after them. Bighearted social worker Bernie (Cheadle) is doing his best to find Andi (Roberts) and the precocious Bruce (Austin) a good family, but he really screws the pooch when he lands the siblings with foster parents Lois and Carl Scudder (Kudrow and Dillon), a dim-witted couple who intend to form a band and drop their rock manifesto on an unsuspecting world.</p><p>Its a mutt movie more in the spirit of <i>Benji the Hunted</i> than <i>Homeward Bound</i>, but the lack of actors lending their voices to the canine conversations isnt a detrimentthe hounds themselves are very expressive without flat celebrity quips about it being a dogs world. As Benji proved, the human element can be more of a hindrance than a help. The film wouldve been better served, however, if the maudlin human struggles and teenybopper romance had been cut and replaced with a bunch of Shiba Inu puppies rolling around the hotel lobby. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For those who like the tone of their films to be reflected in the hairstyles of their lead actors, the wayward shock of auburn-red frizz worn by Sabine Azma in Wild Grass is a good first step to unravelling this joyfully skittish farce from 88-year-old maestro Alain Resnais. Combining the verbose theatrical games of his 80s films with the time, space and character manipulations of early classics such as Last Year at Marienbad, Wild Grass also feels like Resnaiss ode to something like Twin Peaks  a work which is inviting and gentle on the surface but inscrutable and strange the more you look at it. <br />Its based on a surreal novel by French author Christian Gailly called LIncident and details the fallout of a preposterous romance that forms between antisocial house husband Georges Palet (Andr Dussollier) and dentist-cum-budding aviatrix, Marguerite Muir (Azma) when her purse is snatched and he recovers it. Every frame is filled with blushed neon hues that look like theyve been filmed through a smear of Vaseline. The kinetic camera hovers and glides around scenes, at one point even leaping over the top of a house. These stylistic elements  along with a dainty, midi-jazz score  lend the film a dreamlike quality. Whats it all about, though? It could be everything and nothing. There are allusions to psychosis, chaos, reincarnation, anxiety, communication and even the romanticised nature of cinema itself. Its cheeky and confident, maybe one of the directors finest, and its loopy final line is the cryptic cherry on this oddball gteau.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It feels like Phillip Noyces flavourless spy thriller has been precision-built as a femme-fronted riposte to the suits-and-boots male machismo of the Bond franchise. Taken in that context, you cant deny that it succeeds because its every bit as dour, emotionless and nonsensical as Quantum of Solace. Angelina Jolie adopts a licence to pout and a small ocean of hair dye as the slippery, indestructible Evelyn Salt. Shes a svelte CIA operative married to a lovey-dovey arachnologist (arent they all?) whose loyalty is thrown into question when the Cold War flares up again and shes implicated in a Russian conspiracy to have the US vapourised.<br /><br />Its a pulpy, weakly political yarn that strains to maintain momentum by concealing Salts true allegiance, although small, not very subtle details (Why the hell didnt she just shoot me back there?!) essentially reveal which flag shes flying. Australian director Noyce has pedigree in this field, specifically his 90s Jack Ryan movies Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger, yet the focus here is less on creating a credible set of characters and motives than on manufacturing an excuse to have Jolie leapfrog between high-speed lorries. There is the odd moment of exhilaration, such as a vertiginous shot of Salt clinging to the side of an apartment block having evaded her captors, though mostly Noyce demonstrates little feel for movement, rhythm or flow, often allowing fights, chases and ideas to deflate just at the point you feel they should be hitting a higher gear.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Film student Clark Kellogg (Broderick) arrives in New York ready to start his first term, but within minutes smooth-talking hustler Victor Ray (Kirby) has relieved him of money and luggage. When Kellogg later chances across Ray, the latter makes amends by offering the distraught teen a part-time job with his uncle Carmine Sabatini (Brando) who, seen sprawled behind his desk at an Italian 'social club', looks every inch the Godfather. Kellogg's first assignment seems fraught with hazards... Writer/director Bergman's good-natured comedy makes light of gangster genre conventions, and humorously under- cuts some of the more portentous aspects of film academia: Kellogg's plight is rendered farcical when, at a seminar on Coppola's <i>The Godfather</i>, he begins to find disturbing similarities between his life and the movie. The casting, needless to say, is perfect, and Bergman keeps the various escalating intrigues clipping along at a brisk pace.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Kiarostami's masterpiece is a rich, multi-layered but beautifully forthright film in which Sabzian (playing himself - a movie fanatic - in a story based on fact) pretends to a middle-class family likewise interested in cinema that he is film director Makhmalbaf (who also appears as  himself). As the film alternates between scenes of Sabzian's trial for fraud and reconstructions of his encounters with the family and of a journalist's attempts to discover the truth, Kiarostami constructs a complex (but never complicated) series of interwoven narratives to interrogate notions of fiction and documentary, appearance and reality, truth and falsehood. It's enormously intelligent stuff, witty, poignant and thoroughly engrossing, and ends with one of the sharpest, funniest deconstructions of film form ever shot. Absolutely wonderful.]]></review>

Still, it is a reminder that the '60s were not entirely about love, peace and limp liberalism.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A rogue transmission from the underground, Baldwin's ethereal essay in science fact takes a futuristic vantage point - 2007 - to look back over the history (and shadow history) of electricity. Baldwin posits a dissident rear-guard action against the 'New Electro-magnetic Order', but this dramatic concept is really just a hook for analytical channel surfing through time and space. Clearly indebted to Chris Marker (<i>La Jete</i>) and Godard (<i>Alphaville</i>), this is densely textured and tangential, touching on cosmology, spiritualism, capitalism and <i>King Kong</i>. It takes a while to adjust your (mind-)set, but Baldwin warms to his argument as he reaches the age of telecommunications, and the monopolistic commodification of information through corporate control of radio, television, and latterly the Internet. <i>The Terminator</i> for Chomsky fans.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[What other movie opens with Satanism in Greenwich Village, twists into urban paranoia, and climaxes with a suicide? Val Lewton, Russian emigr workaholic, fantasist, was one of the mavericks of Forties' Hollywood, a man who produced (never directed) a group of intelligent and offbeat chillers for next-to-nothing at RKO. All bear his personal stamp: dime-store cinema transformed by 'literary' scripts, ingenious design, shadowy visuals, brooding melancholy, and a tight rein over the direction. <i>The Seventh Victim</i> is his masterpiece, a brooding melodrama built around a group of Satanists. The bizarre plot involves an orphan (Hunter) searching for her death-crazy sister (Brooks), but also carries a strong lesbian theme, and survives some uneven cameos; the whole thing is held together by a remarkably effective mix of menace and metaphysics - half <i>noir</i>, half Gothic.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hanna/Barbera's futuristic follow-up to <i>The Flintstones</i> was launched on TV in 1962 and cancelled after a single season. Syndication has kept it alive for three decades, long enough for Hanna/Barbera to believe that there would be a market for a comeback in the shape of an animated feature film. Big mistake. Top-notch computer graphics, star voices and a gaggle of gadgets cannot disguise the fact that this family of the future is stuck firmly in 1962. Dad struggles for promotion while Mom remains sickeningly supportive, Sis digs shopping and dreamy rock stars, Sonny plays basketball with his robot friend, and the future is a technological Utopia where every man's need is catered for at the push of a button - Dad's job being 'digital index operator' at Spacely Space Sprockets.

      <review><![CDATA[Turning to his favourite video game for solace after everything's gone wrong, Alex Rogan (Guest) finds that the game is a sophisticated recruitment aid for the galactic equivalent of the RAF. By beating the high score, he gets whisked off to shoot the baddies out of the cosmos and save our sector of the universe. All pretty preposterous stuff, but it doesn't take itself seriously for one moment, and even aspires to a gentle parody of the genre. The special effects are mind-expanding: computer-generated animation that is so good it's barely distinguishable from the conventional kind. Great fun, with some truly comical moments; a must for pulp-heads and video-junkies.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Business student Franck (Lespert) returns home as a management trainee in the same factory as his father, a tool operator. Like Bruno Dumont's L'Humanit, this rousing and moving drama grandly (and ironically) invokes our peculiar species in its title, even as it's marked by an understated directorial style that minimises visual flourish and favours non-professional actors. But where Dumont applies a mysterious and distanced gaze, Cantet, for all his formal restraint, fashions a film of communicative intimacy, offering a fresh, relevant and challenging view of work, class and family. If the choice of milieu, a concrete industrial satellite of Paris which we first see through Franck's eyes as he journeys home by train, recalls '60s political Godard, so does the film's evolving class-consciousness. But whatever Cantet's political stance, his methods are dramatic, not didactic. His realism is based on acute, telling observation. The film has its faults. Franck's discovery of secret management plans lacks credibility; the skullduggery of the bosses is overdone; and the father is a little too bovine. But these are quibbles.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>A late-breaking Palme dOr winner at last years Cannes (and one, along with second-place recipient <i>Gomorrah</i>, frequently dismissed as <i>Wire</i> lite), <i>The Class</i> boasts deceptively simple trappings: Its a fiction feature with a documentary gloss, based on a semi-autobiographical novel by its star and cast mostly with nonprofessionals (who supplied some of the story lines), all operating in service of the broader clich of the classroom as a microcosm of society.</p><p>The first half, detailing M. Marins French lessons, is remarkably credible, particularly in the way the character (Bgaudeau) defuses classroom tensions. (Why, his mostly minority students ask, does he use funny American names in his examples?) But its the films second half thats subversive: In a nation committed to protocol and wary of immigrants, a teacher assumes the role of gatekeeper. <i>The Class</i> becomes a study in hypocrisy, with the ostensibly life-saving educator reluctant to fess up to his role in walling off a students potential.</p><p>In its pessimistic undercurrents and portrayal of faculty demoralization, the film is closer to <i>Up the Down Staircase</i> than <i>Dangerous Minds</i>. Certainly, its a less problematic view of culture clash than Cantets sex-tourist chronicle <i>Heading South</i> (2005), which never felt authentic. The camera sticks to the school grounds, giving the film a pleasing modesty of scale. And on its own, consciously limited terms, <i>The Class</i> is a success story. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Alejandro Amenbar, the Spanish director of The Others and The Sea Inside, puts on his sword and sandals  and thinking cap  for this sweeping, ancient-historical drama of ideas. Current debates over religious extremism and scientific rationalism hover subtly over this fictionalisation of events surrounding the sacking of the library at Alexandria in 391 in the face of rising tension between pagans, Christians and Jews. As well as recreating the city with impressive realism and scale, Amenbar develops a compelling sense of volatility and impending violence. At the centre of it all is scientist and teacher Hypatia (a relaxed Rachel Weisz), whose musings on the place of the Earth in the universe run counter to religious dogma.<br /><br />Other characters, such as Hypatias former slave Davus (Max Minghella) and her pupil-turned-Roman prefect Orestes (Oscar Isaac) are only interesting as representatives of change  and not as romantic foils. The build-up of emnity is more absorbing than its explosion and the story wanders later on, but the films portrayal of how religious fervour can interrupt the progress of secular knowledge is acute and welcome.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A decent cast wrestle with a crummy script in this loose and creaky Hollywood spin on Le Dner de Cons, Francis Vebers award-winning French play and film. Middle-ranking corporate investment exec Tim (Paul Rudd) is angling for a promotion, but to seal the deal he has to run along with his blokey bosss invitation to a meal at his mansion to which every guest has to bring an out-and-out idiot. Lucky for Tim, he almost runs over Barry (Steve Carrell), a humourless, thick-skinned tax-office nobody and fan of small stuffed animals. The meal itself, which comes late in the day, feels like an afterthought, with more attention paid to low-grade farcical larks involving Tims fiance Julie (Stephanie Szostak), her self-possessed artist boss (Jemaine Clement), Tims ditzy blonde stalker (Lucy Punch), a potential Swiss investor (David Walliams) and Barrys cruel boss (Zach Galifianakis). Few gags hit the mark, and the ultimate parade of idiots is a failure, especially as someone mistook stupid for eccentric.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Still one of Wilder's funniest satires, its pace flagging only once for a short time. Curtis and Lemmon play jazz musicians on the run after witnessing the St Valentine's Day massacre, masquerading in drag as members of an all-girl band (with resulting gender confusions involving Marilyn) to escape the clutches of Chicago mobster George Raft (bespatted and dime-flipping, of course). Deliberately shot in black-and-white to avoid the pitfalls of camp or transvestism, though the best sequences are the gangland ones anyhow. Highlights include Curtis' playboy parody of Cary Grant, and what is surely one of the great curtain lines of all time: Joe E Brown's bland 'Nobody's perfect' when his fiance (Lemmon) finally confesses that she's a he.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Prolific director Priyadarshans latest is a muddled Bollywood attempt at satire on the hardships faced by the common man in order to progress in modern India. Simpleton Sachin (Kumar) struggles to complete various road and gutter construction contracts as he has to give baksheesh at every point. This overlong film portrays the ingenious means one has to employ to survive in a system endemic to bribery and corruption. However, this accurate observation is swamped by unnecessary and unconnected subplots. This includes the obligatory half-baked romance and dispensable ditties with scantily-clad blonde babes. Kumars customary hamming evokes unintentional laughter especially in a flashback sequence where he plays a college student. He throws in one funny joke at real life ex-girlfriend Shilpa Shettys expense!]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Richard (DiCaprio) finds a treasure map in which 'X' marks the location of the backpacker's Holy Grail: a virgin beach deep in the Gulf of Thailand. In persuading the stunning Franoise (Ledoyen) and her beau Etienne (Canet) to accompany him on the dangerous journey, Richard also commits the cardinal sin of passing on the map to a couple of jocks. What they find on the island is a commune living at one with nature, albeit under the disturbingly stern stewardship of Sal (Swinton). This <i>Heart of Darkness</i>-lite has a techno pulse, lustrous cinematography and stars you could eat. It's only on arrival that problems emerge: there's no flesh on the bones of this island community. Worse, Richard's descent into madness feels distinctly half-baked. Yet the movie works, just about: screenwriter John Hodge has spiked up the romance of Alex Garland's novel and put a sober spin on the finale.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The first 'volume' (choice word) of Tarantino's magnum movie-magpie opus announced itself as 'The fourth film by Quentin Tarantino'. Does that make this companion piece - clocking in at a voluminous 136 mins - his fourth-and-a-half? His fifth? It feels like he's cramming in his sixth, seventh and eighth. Wait six years for one of the geek lord's genre riffs, and then a cartridge-belt of them comes along at once. Those turned off by the first part's reckless, relentless violent purges - and its brazen movie-saturated superficiality - aren't likely to find cause for conversion, but <i>Vol. 2</i> certainly broadens the tale's remit, even as it aims to deepen it. There's more genre shading - everything from Leone and Peckinpah Westerns, through Chinese martial artistry, to nihilist <i>noir</i>, set out like a fanboy flip book - but character and dialogue, too, to ground the outbursts of lethal action. There are more flashbacks to the Bride's backstory, more reflection ('We deserve to die,' Madsen's Budd rather movingly introspects, before reverting to trigger-happy trailer-trash type); Bill (Carradine) is revealed as a mean, melodious Tarantino archetype; all the while the Bride (Thurman) runs the gamut of life lessons, from up the aisle to back from the grave. Does it cohere? Is there a point? Hasn't the movies' great Orobos snake made a meal of his own tail? <i>KBV2</i>'s pathos is a stretch: I'm not sure about an assassin who flunks her assignment at the sight of a home pregnancy-test kit; nor about Tarantino's sentimental blue streak now, after all his merciless groundwork. But you have to admire the chutzpah with which he puts it over.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An unassuming masterpiece, nominally based on Hemingway's novel and set in Martinique during World War II, this is Hawks' toughest statement of the necessity of accepting responsibility for others or forfeiting one's self-respect - the sum total of morality for Hawks - and the perfectbridge from the free and open world of <i>Only Angels Have Wings </i>to the claustrophobic one of <i>Rio Bravo</i>. Bogart is the doubting fishing-boat privateer who finally throws in his hand with the Free French because he loves a girl (Bacall, electric in one of filmdom's most startling debuts), and Walter 'stung by a dead bee' Brennan is his partner. Bogie and Bacall fell in love while making the film, and their scenes reflect this, giving<i> To Have and Have Not</i> a degree of emotional presence that is unusual in the 'bite on the bullet' world of Hawks.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Jazz saxophonist Fred (Pullman) is haunted by anxiety about the fidelity of his wife Renee (Arquette) and the mysterious arrival of video recordings shot inside their house. Fred sees himself, on one tape, next to his wife's battered body, and is arrested for murder. Overnight, Fred vanishes, to be replaced by garage mechanic Pete (Getty), who hasn't a clue how he ended up in jail. To make matters more mystifying, Pete presently becomes involved with Alice (Arquette again), mistress of his gangster pal Mr Eddy (Loggia), leading him into a nightmarish intrigue which only gradually begins to connect, obscurely, with Fred. The plotting, with its inexplicably metamorphosed protagonist and its various doubles, makes one suspect Lynch may be having us on. It's ironic, then, that narrative is the most intriguing thing about the film, leading us either to dismiss it as pretentious rubbish or to try to make sense of it on a metaphorical level. Fortunately, Lynch's mastery of mood through sound, space, decor and lighting means that we're more or less engrossed throughout, even though some of the sillier moments - not to mention the uncharacteristically clumsy use of music - try one's patience.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An over-long and only spasmodically amusing romantic comedy, clearly made as a tribute to Lubitsch. Set in Paris, it concerns the predictably blooming love between wealthy American playboy Cooper and Hepburn, the innocent but determined daughter of Chevalier's private detective, whose cuckold client (John McGiver) intends to take revenge on Cooper with a pistol. The script - Wilder's first with IAL Diamond - has its moments, but by and large it's conspicuously lacking in insight or originality, while Hepburn's fresh-faced infatuation for her all too visibly ageing guide to the adult, sensual world comes across as faintly implausible.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A James Bond/Mission: Impossible pastiche mixing live action with talking CG animals, this 3D sequel to 2001s witless farrago is such an irredeemable failure that, judging by the silent reaction of every child at the screening, I would guess they would rather have been at home doing trigonometry. No improbable stone is left unturned as the convoluted 60s-style spy caper unfolds to present a tale of conflict between two of mankinds most popular pets. On one side we have the secret, ultra-hi-tech organisation, Dogs HQ, and on the other, the terrifying spectre of a bald pussy with plans to take over the world. You do wonder how this odious enterprise ever got the green light: the script suggests it was developed on the hoof; the CGI is low grade stuff; and the human performances are loathsome. Worst of all, its not even funny. Very paw.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Although a bit like a four-hour Sunday school lesson, 'Ben-Hur' is not without its compensations, above all, of course, the chariot race (which was directed not by Wyler but by Andrew Marton, and it shows). The rest is made interesting by the most sexually ambivalent characters sporting togas this side of <i>Satyricon. </i>When not fondling phallic substitutes, Heston and Boyd gaze admiringly into each other's eyes, but when they fall out - well, hell hath no fury like a closet queen scorned. Heston ends up naked in the galleys where he's rowing and Jack Hawkins is commanding; one look at Chuck's rippling muscles, and Hawkins adopts him. Heston goes back for revenge on Boyd, who's lying around in the baths with his men looking like they're auditioning for <i>Sebastiane. </i>Along the way, an unbilled Jesus performs miracles for Ben's kinsfolk, which are convincing enough to convert him. The movie could be trying to say that for some people religion is an escape from their sexuality, but it seems unlikely.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Given what Breillats <i>Anatomy of Hell </i>did for the gothic romancenamely, place the two lovers in an off-putting arena of sexual one-upmanship, at one point incorporating a rusty garden hoeits no surprise that with <i>The Last Mistress</i>, the scandal-courting French director aims to coarsen the corset drama. Her homage to Choderlos de Laclos (based on an 1851 novel by Jules Barbey dAurevilly) sets its tone in its opening scene, which shows Lonsdale lustily scarfing down a chicken dinner. Other movies feature duels between the young suitor and the elderly husband whose wife hes seduced. But until now, none has included the sight of Argento licking the bullet wound.</p><p>The boyish libertine in question (Aattou) never seems to age, even though he tells his story in flashbacks that span a decade. Hes about to be married to a young woman from a good background (Mesquida, again playing the victim, as in Breillats <i>Fat Girl</i> and <i>Sex Is Comedy</i>), but the reappearance of a feral old flame (Argento, a force of nature) poses a threat. With its aura of romantic intrigue, this could be a Breillat film for people whove never seen any of her abrasive, hard-core disquisitions on the battle of the sexes. Still, flaunting the artifice of her sets, Breillat slyly plays this melodrama for her own brand of raunchy comedy.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The movie's artistic credentials couldn't be more imposing (in addition to the various expatriate Surrealists/Dadaists who contributed episodes, there is music by John Cage and Darius Milhaud, among others), but that makes its manifest failure all the more striking. Richter has created a feeble pastiche of the contemporary <i>film noir</i> as the framing story, centring on a man with the power to generate dreams; other contributions are therefore integrated as dream sequences. The movie quickly degenerates into a series of party pieces: Duchamp rehashes his 'roto-reliefs' of 1927, Lger animates dolls, Calder animates his mobiles, and so on. Only Ernst, who recreates an image-sequence from his collage-novel <i>La Semaine de la Bont</i> in live action terms, emerges with much credit.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The title may invoke Leone, but this brash, flamboyant third instalment of Rodriguez's Mariachi cycle was plainly also influenced by <i>Mad Max</i>, Jackie Chan and Sam Peckinpah. El Mariachi (Banderas) is prised out of mourning retirement by crooked CIA agent Depp to foil an assassination plot against the Mexican president, only to become a pawn in drug baron Dafoe's bigger scheme. Motifs and plot points are hardly explained and certain characters are so sketchily drawn it's hard to work out why they're there. The one point of calm in the ever-increasing din is Banderas, a tousled, beatific presence, given to striking dreamy poses with his guitar. This is a self-indulgent mess, but in its own harum-scarum way, it's also kind of fun - zestful, eccentrically cast and peppered with striking set pieces. Rodriguez wrote, co-produced, scored, shot and edited the film, as well as directing it - in two months, on digital video. In other words, despite having a studio behind him, he's behaving as if he was still the same no-budget auteur who made <i>El Mariachi</i> for $7,000. Lighten the workload, Robert, and learn to collaborate.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A pretty faithful adaptation of Elmore Leonard's <i>Rum Punch</i>, Tarantino's finest, most mature movie to date centres on airline steward Jackie (Grier), picked up by the Feds at LAX with cash and drugs destined for gun  trader Ordell (Jackson). Reluctant to do time and aware that Ordell tends to murder anyone he suspects might turn informer, she decides to play cops and criminals - not only Ordell, but his former cellmate Louis (De Niro) and pothead girlfriend Melanie (Fonda) - against each other, confiding only in Max (Forster), the world-weary bail bondsman Ordell hired to get her out of jail in the first place. What's immediately rewarding is that Tarantino forgoes flash patter, stand-offs and stylistic flourishes in favour of a closer focus on character (women included), relationships, motives and mood. Also crucial to our actually coming to care about these people is the terrific acting (Grier and Forster make you wonder where they've been all these years). But perhaps most surprising and welcome is that this is a subtle poignant account of middle-aged people trying to come to terms with failing faculties, fading looks, diminishing options and a need to make their lives count somehow.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Late in Nancy Drew, the eponymous brainiac sleuth inadvertently
launches a fashion trend: "the new sincerity." Its a label that
applies not only to Nancys wardrobe, but to the film itself. Despite a
few flirtations with Clueless-style satire, the movielike the books on
which it's basedis basically a straight-up, 12-and-under mystery, with
all the clues plainly apparent and all the villains eager to growl
their motives in Nancys direction. You get what you pay for, in other
words. Transplanting Nancy from her hometown (in an unknown state) to
Los Angeles turns out to be mainly a way of setting the story in
Hollywood, which enables Flemingof the overrated Nixon comedy Dick
(1999)to craft a sort of Sunset Blvd. for kids. Nancy (an uberchirpy
Roberts) and her father (Donovan) move into what might be Norma
Desmonds decaying mansion, inspiring the girl wonderwhos trying,
really trying, to behave like a normal teenagerto investigate the
mysterious death of its former occupant, movie star Dehlia Draycott
(Harring). Fleming has fun establishing atmosphere, setting key scenes
in a cluttered hall of records and on the rafters of a decaying
theater. Solving the mystery wouldnt be beyond your average remedial
student, let alone a girl who drives a car (legally?), carries a bungee
cord in her purse and who, having stumbled onto a film shoot, proves a
surprisingly capable auteur. Bet you the Hardy Boys never did that.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Dozens of quality kid-lit staples have been turned into decent-to-drab movies; why should Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzis award-winning series be exempt? Thankfully, the initial outing for the Grace familyrebellious Jared (Highmore); his appeasing twin, Simon (Highmore again); and their bossy sister, Mallory (Bolger)sees the trio getting better screen treatment than, say, Lemony Snickets Gothic rug rats or Philip Pullmans prepubescent heroine. Waters (<i>Mean Girls</i>) retains the recipe of mythological beasties, a magic journal and underage messiah complexes, throwing in the requisite celebrity-voiced CGI creatures (Martin Short and Seth Rogen provide comic relief, while Nick Noltes two-pack-a-day rasp has never been used to better effect). And since childrens fantasy now fulfills the need that fairy tales once did (i.e., helps tots psychologically process the adult world in terms they understand) the film makes sure the storys abandonment issues come full circle.</p><p>But what <i>The Spiderwick Chronicles</i> fails to capture is the sense of pixie-dusted wonderment that makes Black and DiTerlizzis tomes such page-turners. Other than Highmores impressive double-duty act, most viewers will find the film indistinguishable from every other kids-in-pointy-hats adaptation of the past few years. The voice of the novels is lost in translation; whats left is something thats merely by the book.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Breillat's movie begins with Jeanne (Parillaud) directing a scene on a windy beach. She's not happy. Her young actors (Colin, Mesquida) are not kissing as passionately as she wants, and she knows the chill's due only in part to the weather: they don't like each other. Moreover, the actor is arrogant, moody, probably dubious about being directed by a woman, and nervy about a prosthetic penis he has to wear for a long scene where his character uses emotional blackmail to persuade the girl that penetrative sex is okay. While the actress is happier with Jeanne, she still finds it hard to relax for the camera, and is yet to be told of the false dick and the degree of nudity expected. Meanwhile, Jeanne must battle not only with cast, crew and climate, but also with her own doubts and bouts of creative block. Breillat's prime subject is how a film-maker may mould ideas, instincts and experiences into art, using as raw materials human individuals and the illusionism of cinema: an illusionism more than ever necessary if what's wanted is a plausible picture of sexual desire and passion. To attain what we will accept as 'real', the director must pretend, pontificate, flirt, seduce, caress, cajole, cavil, provoke jealousy and discontent, provide security and finally comfort, all in pursuit of lies that look like truth when flickered on to a screen.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[You was my brudda. You shoulda looked out for me a little bit I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum When the washed-up Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro) quotes On The Waterfront to himself, it tells us as much about his self-pity as the actual parallels with Brandos Terry Malloy. Not just a contender but a champ, La Mottas fall stemmed not from outside pressures but inner weaknesses, stunningly realised in De Niros colossal performance; both he and Scorsese have arguably never been better. Following  from 1941 to 1964 the explosively jealous and narcissistic middle-weight, his brother-manager Joey  Joe Pesci, great in his breakthrough role, first of the badabing pairings with De Niro that would define his career  and Jakes tenderised wife Vickie (Cathy Moriarty), Raging Bull is a masterclass in pain inflicted on oneself and ones loved ones, as well as ones opponents. The use of pop and opera and the black-and-white photography (by Michael Chapman) are exemplary, the actual boxing a compulsive dance of death.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Theyre lean, green and on the big screen, again. Cowabunga, dudes! Fifteen years after their first cinematic foray, the pizza-loving, sewer-dwelling, crime-fighting Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are back. However, in stark contrast to the 1990 live-action original (as well as sequels in 91 and 93), which relied on animatronics and short guys in foam suits, this CGI-animated update is fluid, kinetic and action-packed. Its dark tone is also closer to Peter Laird and Kevin Eastmans 1984 comic-book than to the cute computer-game and TV cartoon spin-offs which followed.<br />In modern New York, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello and Raphael, together with their sewer-rat sensei Splinter, are pitted against multi-billionaire Maximillian J Winters, four re-born stone generals, sundry 3,000-year-old monsters and the turtles old ninja rivals the Foot Clan. The turtles superfluous human side-kicks serve to complicate an already confusing plot. Even so, Kevin Munroe directs with affection and skill. Its not exactly Renaissance art, but it is an honourable attempt to revive the turtle-tastic franchise.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For all those hoping that Sylvester Stallones much-touted The Expendables would be a sardonic, fourth-wall shattering action spectacular that toyed affectionately with the meat-headed conventions of such retrograde 1980s artefacts as Cobra, Rambo and Commando, well, dont break out the foam-dome and Whitesnake records just yet<br />If ever a test case were required to prove the theory that shit in quote marks is still shit, this is it. The Expendables is a sluggish, derivative, witless farrago which is laser-targeted to the nostalgia set and would surely have gone straight to DVD were it not for Stallones recent run at the box office with belated sequels to his Rocky and Rambo franchises.<br />The Expendables is  once again  about ageing fighters who remain happily out of sync with the modern world, though its more Wild Hogs than No Country For Old Men, concerned less with growing old gracefully than with clinging to a state of perpetual adolescence in which fast cars, tattoos and knifes all remain indescribably cool. Sly is Barney Ross, the stogie-chomping front man to a ragtag, cosily diverse unit of jaded, muscle-bound mercenaries who accept jobs that no-one else in their right mind would touch. Stallone has lost much of the loveable-lug lustre of his early years and seems to have turned into his own Spitting Image puppet, spending the entire film looking like hes watching a fly perched on the end of his nose. <br />We open on the gang dealing with a fleet of Somalian pirates, revealing that  unsurprisingly  diplomacy is not a term in their lexicon. Before you can say, Hey, whats Dolph Lundgren doing with that 12-gauge?, a hostage-taker has been shot through the torso and the whole vessel is submerged in gunfire. And so the depressingly reactionary tone is set, offering the first hint that the title of the film refers as much to the groups view of other human beings as it does to themselves. <br />Settling for the most rudimentary of save-the-maiden/topple-the-dicator plotlines and wheeling out tough-guy clichs by rote, innovation and skill are notable by their absence. And as if things werent bad enough, Stallone mysteriously opts to photograph the entire film in extreme close-up, which a) allows you to see just how shallow all the characters are, b) alerts you to the shoddiness of the effects, and c) means that all the action scenes look like an indiscriminate tangle of bloody body parts. <br />Elsewhere, pickings remain slim. Cameo appearances by Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger serve no function whatsoever bar allowing Stallone to make a cheap allusion to Arnies day job (a Planet Hollywood gag wouldve been funnier), while the inclusion of a romantic sub-plot exists solely to allow Jason Statham to furnish retributive justice on the local wife-beater. Theres even a fight scene inspired by a racial stereotype, as Jet Li engages in a warehouse tussle with Lundgren and gains the advantage because hes so short.<br />Even if Slys sense of irony hadnt been lost in the mail, The Expendables would still be unsalvageable. Its a film that exists in a cultural limbo, where life, history and filmmaking appear to have ceased at the moment Ronald Reagan left office. Still, if you like watching men with no necks thumping each other, this could be your Citizen Kane.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Street-dancing films should come with their own rating category: not suitable for over-15s. This one, number three in the franchise, is filmed like a deodorant ad  with the same nuances of character and story. It follows Moose (Adam G Sevani), a dancer who arrives in New York to start university after promising his parents to hang up his Nikes. Instead he falls in with a crew that needs to win the $100,000 prize in a dance-off championship to keep their studio open.<br />The 3D format has found a playmate in dance. The skills of the dancers  most are acting for the first time (it shows)  are exhilarating. If only there were more drop kicks and fewer banal lines. No clich is left unearthed: Weve become like a pseudo family, says the crew leader  in case you missed the bunk-beds. An 18-year-old dancer, Sevani as Moose lightens the load; a natural, hes sweet and funny, and gives what should be a breakout performance if any grown-ups are watching.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A great running gag is a tricky thing to pull off: get it right and youre looking at a bottomless well of laughs, get it wrong and youve got a predictable, tiresome joke that just wont die. The Other Guys may lack depth, insight, ambition or artistic integrity. But with no less than three successful running gags  one involving four tramps having sex in a cop car  its hard to imagine a sane audience complaining.<br />The other guys are Allen (Will Ferrell) and Terry (Mark Wahlberg). Theyre decent cops stuck on desk duty in the shadow of superior officers Danson (Dwayne Johnson) and Highsmith (Samuel L Jackson). Theres a plot in there somewhere its got something to do with Steve Coogan as a corrupt businessman  but frankly its not worth thinking too much about. This is a movie with a single purpose, which it pursues with relentless efficiency and a spectacular rate of success: The Other Guys just wants to make you laugh until it hurts.<br />To this end, writer-director and regular Ferrell collaborator Adam McKay employs a catalogue of tried-and-tested techniques. There are two solidly drawn, superbly played mismatched heroes (Wahlberg has never been better). Theres the sprawling cast of lunatic suporting characters, notably Michael Keatons TLC-quoting police captain. Theres the usual unlikely romantic pairing: Ferrells nerdy, obsessive loser is married to an appealingly self-deprecating Eva Mendes. And theres a wealth of joyously berserk idiot humour, fusing slapstick and satire, surrealism and stream-of-consciousness improv into what could well prove the funniest movie of the year.]]></review>

It is most successful when it keeps to the tone of an insane fairystory set up at the beginning of the movie.]]></review>

Above all it looks terrific, with Mamoulian indulging his passion for shadows, while Arthur Miller's camerawork makes striking use of the contrasting white Spanish architecture and black of Zorro's cape and costume. Rathbone, rarely without a rapier in his hand and forever ferociously limbering up ('He's always stabbing at something' someone wearily complains) until he is summarily skewered in the magnificent final duel, is outstanding as Zorro's malevolent adversary.]]></review>

Imagine the same old '50s airplane yarn: pilots poisoned, passengers panic, while a traumatised war-hero lands the jalopy. It should be disastrous. But psycho ground controllers (Stack and Bridges), laff-a-second pace, and bludgeoning innuendo make this the acceptable face of the locker-room satire. DMacp.]]></review>

A cracking little thriller about a pair of Treasury agents (O'Keefe and Ryder) required to infiltrate a Detroit counterfeiting gang, it effortlessly transcends its semi-documentary brief (with blandly 'official' commentary) to land deep in <i>noir </i>territory, concerned less with the heroic exploits of its T-Men than with personality perversities involved in undercover work (the wrenching imperative to deny friends, wives, feelings, even to the point of standing by while a partner is cold-bloodedly executed).

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Too fuzzy and indistinct to work on either a literal or a metaphoric level, <i>The Signal</i> nonetheless pulses with enough random static to hold viewers attentionand not just gorehounds. The setting is a vague megalopolis, mossy in the greenish cast of some truly ugly videography. One nondescript day, all of the televisions begin to emit an odd warble, accompanied by a gooey color pattern that uncharitable moviegoers might liken to a Lava lamp. People begin to go crazyas in George Romeros <i>The Crazies</i>and wield sharp objects. Oh, that devilish media of ours.</p><p>Nothing new here. But the three people behind the camera have each staked out a third of the running time for themselves, creating some unlikely tonal shifts for a horror film, ranging from straight-ahead thrills in a segment about an unfaithful wife (Ramsey) to dark chuckles at a party scene run amok, featuring the most unsettling maintenance man in indie-flick history (Bowen). An earlier cut of the film that played at Sundance found a nice fulcrum in Lou Reeds droll Perfect Daywhich has since been replaced for rights reasons with an inferior Joy Division coverand the irony of Reeds croaking vocal helped a lot. Now, <i>The Signal</i> broadcasts against its generic qualities, but only in spurts and waves.</p>]]></review>

Enjoy the high-wire tension of Losey's direction, the lurking paranoia that charges his images with electricity. Losey's first British feature, made under a pseudonym in the shadow of the blacklist, it sheds the classic modulations of <i>The Prowler</i>.

But the basement is also home to a strange and unusual plant, a growing, bloodthirsty demon determined to devour mankind. It's hard to pinpoint just what makes this surreal saga such a delight. There's the music, a wonderful doowop score from the off-Broadway hit based on Corman's 1960 cult classic. There's the antics of Second City veteran comedians (Murray, Candy, Belushi). There's Steve Martin as 'The Dentist', Audrey's biker-boyfriend, a happy-go-lucky sadist who nearly steals the show. And finally there's the plant, a 50-ft jiving, root-stomping, vegetable from whose 49-ft lips comes the voice of Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops.

Wiry and perched on high heels, he makes an unlikely gigolo, which any amount of coy pouting and flashing eye contact cannot disguise. He is, of course, lampooning himself wildly (isn't he?). His buddy (Benton, currently one of his backing singers) is a far more believable character, in what is rather a wasted supporting cast. Shot in black-and-white in an attempt to evoke the sophisticated burr of '40s films, its intent is hamstrung by over-familiar gags, though the script comes more to life when Prince and Benton lapse into black street talk during their pursuit of moneyed women.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Detractors have always pegged Tarantino as a precocious fanboy who
sees everything through the scrim of his video-store fantasies.
Certainly, anyone who subscribes to that view is smacking his or her
lips over the idea of <i>Inglourious Basterds</i>, in which QT has the temerity to apply his pastiche style to a serious subject.</p><p>But <i>Inglourious Basterds</i>
is less about World War II than about World War II moviesor more
broadly, how movies can be used to rewrite history. Right from its
misspelled titletaken, with little else, from the 1978 <i>Dirty Dozen</i> knockoff <i>The Inglorious Bastards</i>its clear Tarantinos story unfolds in an alternate reality.</p><p>The first chapter of <i>Inglourious Basterds</i> begins once upon a timein Nazi-occupied France, situating us in Sergio Leone territory (with a few of <i>Pearl Harbor</i>s
billowing-laundry shots thrown in). The multilingual Col. Hans Landa
(instant star Waltz) visits a French farmer and, in the first of the
movies many language-based deceptions, tricks him into revealing the
location of the Jews hiding underneath his floorboards. Words matter,
and Landa turns out to be particularly concerned with how history will
record his actions.</p><p>The familys lone survivor, Shoshanna
(Laurent), hides in Paris, running a movie theater that amusingly
programs Henri-Georges Clouzots anti-collaborationist allegory <i>Le Corbeau</i> alongside G.W. Pabst and Arnold Fancks Nazi-appropriated mountain drama <i>The White Hell of Pitz Palu</i>. Shoshanna is forced to host the premiere of a new Nazi propaganda film, <i>Nations Pride</i>, and plans a revenge that involves igniting a stash of nitrate film. Indeed, <i>Basterds</i> extends the metaphor to posit moviemaking as an explosive act.</p><p>Meanwhile,
a parallel sabotage plot unites British military intelligence with a
team of ragtag Jewish American soldiers led by Pitts uproariously
twangy Lt. Aldo Raine; in the films most outlandish conceit, his
platoon travels the countryside scalping Nazis in a self-proclaimed
Apache resistance. (The group is also likened to the insurgency in <i>The Battle of Algiers</i>.) <i>Basterds</i>
proceeds methodically from genre to genreWestern, war drama, spy film,
propagandato show us how movies have interpreted the past.</p><p>Tarantino
is, of course, perfectly conscious of the fact that his film plays like
a revenge fantasy; in a pointed line, a character says Goebbels thinks <i>Nations Pride</i> will be his masterpiece, just as Tarantino signals <i>Basterds</i> will be his own. But <i>Inglourious Basterds</i> is hardly, like Paul Verhoevens equally invigorating <i>Black Book</i>,
an exercise in relativism; rather, its a celebration of cinemas
cathartic, at times dangerously influential power. Its also a hugely
enjoyable homage to the way Hollywood spun the war even as it happened.</p><p>For
all its originality, this hall of mirrors is the closest Tarantino has
come to making a film with old-fashioned, movie-movie appeal. There
wont be a scene this year as tense as <i>Basterds</i>s
extraordinary 20-minute centerpiece, in which double agent/movie star
Bridget von Hammersmark (Kruger) and disguised film critic Archie Hicox
(<i>Hunger</i>s
Fassbender, doing a dead-on Trevor Howard) try to convince a tavern
full of Nazis of their allegiances. (The sequence now begins less
smoothly than it did at Cannes, thanks to the addition of an
expositional scene before it.)</p><p>This is the type of suspense one finds in Hitchcocks <i>Notorious</i>, while Landas dialogue about his nickname (the Jew Hunter) seems a direct nod to Concentration Camp Ehrhardt in <i>To Be or Not To Be</i>. Although some have dismissed <i>Basterds</i> as talky, boring, or worse, mismarketedcharges once leveled at <i>Jackie Brown</i>its only digressive in a way weve come to expect from Tarantino, who deftly interweaves comedy and danger.</p><p><i>Kill Bill</i> circled back to complicate our feelings on revenge; the more elegantly interwoven <i>Basterds</i>
goes deeper, functioning both as glossy epic and filmed film criticism.
It offers ample proof of Tarantinos capacity to grow as an artist,
even if its not growth in a direction that everyone will like.
Inglourious basterd, indeed.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>It may be glib to call this the funniest Holocaust-themed doc yet made, but its the truth. <i>New York Times </i>writer Andrew Jacobs makes his warmly entertaining directorial debut, inspired by a series of articles he filed on summers in the Catskills. For the past quarter century, a group of Holocaust survivors has headed upstate annually for rowdy poker games, kvetching and telling corny jokes. But the richest punch line is also the most melancholic: Celebrating the fact that theyre still alive is their ultimate revenge on Hitler. Now the posse faces another tyrantDeathas they reach their autumn years; the underlying drama here is that this might be the last time this community will exist.</p><p>Since the film is built mostly on caught moments, Jacobs couldnt have asked for a stronger point guard: Vrit pioneer Albert Maysles (Gimme Shelter, Grey Gardens) serves as his lead cinematographer. Some of the observations are priceless, like the man quietly boasting that Dr. Mengele liked him, and the film doesnt shy away from kick-in-the-gut moments like watching two men react to a sick woman screaming in the distance. But whats most beautiful of all is that this document ensures that these people will indeed live on forever. Take that, Nazis! </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Learning, especially from Scorsese, in his approach to action and performance, writer/director/star Stallone has somehow contrived to make each of his movies into a more magnificent spectacle than the last, eliminating much of the coy sentimentality that tainted the first film, and pacing the boxing scenes with an increasing fury that makes them less like a sport than the epic symbolic struggle of Ray Harryhausen monsters. 'The worst thing happened to you that could happen to any fighter' someone tells Rocky here, 'You got civilised'. And <i>Rocky III</i> depicts the fighter's struggle to come to terms with success, in a progression from danger and defeat to triumph which - as in all the best genre movies - is incredibly simple. As audience movie-making in its purest form, the film is a delight, but it's also so obviously based on Stallone's own personal struggle with success that the mind boggles as to what Rocky can possibly do next. Make movies, perhaps?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This adaptation of Elizabeth Goudges much-loved 1946 novel The Little White Horse (JK Rowlings girlhood favourite, no less) has all the ingredients of a classic childrens story. Theres a lonely orphan dispatched to a big house in the country after her fathers demise. Theres Moonacre manor itself, with its secret passages, spooky woodlands and a mysterious spectral white horse galloping in the fields. And theres a mystery to be solved, as clues in an illustrated manuscript tell of an ancient curse on the land a curse only a Moon Princess can lift. <br />What with Ioan Gruffudd glowering as the surly uncle, a steady supply of new dresses and a touch of tween romance, its all expertly tailored for slightly bookish little girls, with Golden Compass star Dakota Blue Richards an agreeably unprissy lead. Unfortunately, the fate of Moonacre Valley is a slightly academic issue, so we never care as much as we should. Nicely put together, but just a little dull.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Todd Solondz is still perhaps best known for Happiness, the awkward yet affecting story of an extended New Jersey family, and one of the few recent movies to feature a father-son heart-to-heart about paedophilia. Life During Wartime picks up the story a decade on. The characters are the same but the actors different: when child rapist Bill, played then by Dylan Baker and now by Ciarn Hinds, is released from prison, his wife Trish (Allison Janney) and sons try to deal with the fallout; her sisters Joy (Shirley Henderson) and Helen (Ally Sheedy), meanwhile, wrangle with dead lovers and the vagaries of Hollywood. Solondzs ongoing interests in young adolescence and social taboos ensure some shocks but his underlying interests are sincere and humane: the consequences of trauma, the capacity for self-delusion, the possibility of change and the necessity of forgiveness.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Lumpish biopic, historically laughable as it pursues Hollywood's perennial view of the artist as solitary and star-crossed in both life and love. What taste can do, Huston does, abetted by Paul Sheriff's set designs and some fine colour camerawork from Oswald Morris. But playing Toulouse Lautrec on his knees, Ferrer could equally well be begging for mercy from the script. Best bit is the first reel, which evokes the spirit of Paris in the Naughty Nineties in a swirling mass of colour and movement.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>A Dublin street musician in his thirties (Hansard, the frontman for
Irish band the Frames) meets a female Czech immigrant of about 20
(Irglov, who recently recorded an album with Hansard). He's still
pining for his ex-girlfriend, whos gone to London, but after some
initial hemming and hawing, it becomes painfully clear that hes
romantically interested in his new friend (neither character ever gets
a name), who turns out to be a talented piano player. Over the course
of one week, they engage in a delicate almost-courtship through music,
always aware of the obstacles that stand between them (she has a kid
and, gulp, an estranged husband back in the Czech Republic; hes too
old for her and still stuck on his ex).</p><p> </p><p>There's a lot of music making in <i>Once</i>, and Carney and his
cast make it a stand-in for the conventional moves of romance. When
Hansard teaches Irglov a song called "Falling Slowly" and she works
out a piano part and a vocal harmony, it's clear they are both falling,
and not so slowly. It's one of the most romantic scenes in any film in
recent memory, though they don't even touch.</p><p> </p><p>Some are calling this film a musical, but it certainly doesn't look
or feel like one. Carney shoots with a handheld camera and his actors
give the dialogue the awkward stilted cadences and tentative stops and
starts of real speech. Every emotion is raw and real, and by the end we
were wiping more than one tear from our eyes, partly out of gratitude

      <review><![CDATA[Not the first movie to be built around cameo performances, but these are somewhat novel. Forties stars (Bergman, Bogart, Cagney, etc.) are exhumed from the Hollywood vaults to live again in a new mystery comedy whose convolutions stem not least from forcing various clips from old thrillers to look as though they belong together. Some amusement is derived from watching a film that so obviously had to be worked out backwards. The bits in between feature likeable Martin as a keen but clumsy detective - with all the good lines, which is no bad thing because he's the best part of this fairly amusing, clever exercise in editing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Though perhaps it tries too hard to be 'respectable' and downplays its tawdry trash vulgarity a little too much (the film is tough, but William Lindsay Gresham's superb novel is even tougher), this is still a mean, moody, and well-nigh magnificent melodrama. Power excels as the hick fairground huckster who rises to society celebrity as a fake spiritualist, only to have fickle fortune arc him back to the midway as the boozed-up, live-chicken-eating geek. Blondell, Gray and the strange Helen Walker are the women he uses/abuses to grease his path. Lee Garmes' camerawork, Jules Furthman's script, and Goulding's direction make this one of the most oddball and enduring of the decade's Hollywood highspots.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Bowdlerised but pleasant enough adaptation, by George Axelrod, of Truman Capote's novel, with Hepburn rather too winsome as the Manhattan callgirl Holly Golightly, who has an on-off relationship with Peppard's writer, himself juggling an affair with a (Neal) wealthy patroness. The party scenes and intimations of hipness now look dated, and it's all rather too sugary for its own good (Henry Mancini's award-winning 'Moon River' being symptomatic); but taken as a shallow fairytale it has a certain charm.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[No, not a satirical documentary about Market Harborough, but a rare example - actually, the only example - of whimsical <i>noir</i>. Routinely the film assembles its angst-racked characters: the cop tempted into dishonesty for love of a stripper, the ageing attorney with a bored young wife, the killer who dotes on his pet rabbit, etc. Familiar images recur: a fugitive darting across a railroad yard, headlights slicing down an alley, a sudden sweaty close-up. But then the film tilts towards fantasy with the introduction of Wills as the Spirit of the City, no less, materialising for the night as Young's ghostly patrol car partner, observing the action with Buddha-like understanding. Gig and Chill aside, this is an averagely satisfying thriller, inventively shot on wintry Chicago locations.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A former child actor (<i>City Lights</i>) and celebrated editor (for Ford; an Oscar-winner for <i>Body and Soul</i>), Parrish directed one master-piece (<i>The Wonderful Country</i>), one almost-masterpiece (<i>The Purple Plain</i>) and a gallery of engaging, civilised movies before getting tangled in the shoals of the swinging British '60s. His major theme is of a man seeking not so much an identity as a place to belong, and here, in his directorial debut, the theme lurks behind a low-budget thriller framework as ex-bookie Powell exits the slammer to get revenge on the bad guys who put him there. Shot in 22 days (Parrish rewrote the script with William Bowers), it's the kind of movie in which, told to expect someone extra for dinner, delicious Fleming smiles 'OK, I'll put more water in the soup'. With excellent support players like a young, thin (for him) William Conrad and Jay Adler, this is a fast, crisp and laconic delight.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Riveting example of Siodmak's skill not only in transforming indifferent material, but in giving the feel of studio <i>noir</i> to location shooting. The familiar '30s theme (cop and criminal sharing the same deprived background in New York's Little Italy) acquires an almost metaphysical ring in being displaced by what turns into a literal cry of the city as the wounded gangster (Conte, terrific) goes on the run for the last few hours of his life, leaving behind him a dark trail of murder, pain and betrayal. Rarely has the cruel, lived-in squalor of the city been presented in such telling detail, both in the vivid portrayal of ghetto life and in the astonishing parade of corruption uncovered in the night (a slug-like shyster; a monstrous, sadistic masseuse; a sleazy refugee abortionist, etc).]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[While 1940s cinema was packed with devious dames, few can match Peggy Cumminss hellcat sharpshooter Laurie Starr for sheer manipulative allure. Meeting Laurie at a small-town carny, clean-cut gun nut Bart (a perplexed John Dall) is transfixed by her charms and prowess with a pistol. The two cut a swathe through the Southern states, holding up banks and evading a tightening police dragnet.<br />Gun Crazy is a magnificently enjoyable film, distinguished by Joseph H Lewiss restless, catch-all directorial style; visually, the film ranges from classic gritty noir to hyperstylised modern gothic, to a startling single-take hold-up sequence shot on crowded streets. The filmmakers never miss a chance for a sly Freudian aside: from Barts little problem with guns (he can point, but he cant shoot) to Lauries zealous lust for control, Gun Crazy is awash with hysterical symbolism. A genuine treat.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Since Prince first appeared on stage caressing the long neck of his guitar and sucking at its quivering head, he has been a man to watch. And if at first it was just to check that he did not creep up from behind, it burgeoned into something else...respect, earned by his raunchy, inventive brand of funk and the sense that here was someone who could be truly great. The considerable appeal of the film depends upon his presence, and luckily the man sweats charisma, for the plot is at best predictable, at worst incomprehensible. Partly autobiographical, part fiction, it tells of The Kid (Prince), product of a broken home and an impregnable ego, struggling to the top of the rock heap. His girlfriend Apollonia loves him but is attracted by his arch-enemy, lead singer with rival band The Time (it gets very reductionist). But this is all no more than fancy padding around the film's heart, which only starts to really pump when Prince is up on stage: a teasing, hot amalgam of Marc Bolan, Nijinsky and the Scarlet Pimpernel, as electric as his guitar.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In its own old-fashioned way, this is as satisfying as that other, more modernist Thomas Harris adaptation, <i>Manhunter</i>. When FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Foster) is sent to conduct an interview with serial killer shrink Dr Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) in his high-security cell, she little knows what she is in for. The Feds want Lecter to help them in their search for homicidal maniac 'Buffalo Bill'; but in exchange for clues about Bill's behaviour, Lecter demands that Clarice answer questions about herself, so that he can penetrate the darkest recesses of her mind. It's in their confrontations that both film and heroine come electrically alive. Although Demme does reveal the results of the killer's violence, he for the most part refrains from showing the acts themselves; the film could never be accused of pandering to voyeuristic impulses. Under-standably, much has been made of Hopkins' hypnotic Lecter, but the laurels must go to Levine's killer, admirably devoid of camp overstatement, and to Foster, who evokes a vulnerable but pragmatic intelligence bent on achieving independence through sheer strength of will.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Definitely a walk on the wild side, this has Crawford as a well-heeled playwright sacking hatchet-faced Palance from her latest production as lacking the right romantic personality, then falling for him in a whirlwind courtship when they 'happen' to meet on a train. Cue for a deadly cat-and-mouse game as Palance, aided by sulky Grahame, sets out to kill Crawford for her money and she uses her playwright's wiles to devise a counterplot. With suspense screwed way beyond the sticking point, superb camerawork from Charles Lang, and Crawford in nerve-janglingly extravagant form, it's hugely enjoyable.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Alexandre Aja says his 3D re-working of Joe Dantes 1978 original is an attempt to recreate the guilty pleasure movies of his youth. So here, in the best/worst traditions of '70s exploitation cinema, are flesh-eating fishy gore, lip-smacking nudity and lots of laugh-out-loud silliness. If youre looking for the anti-establishment message found in the John Sayles scripted, Roger Corman-produced Jaws rip-off, you will be disappointed. However, the re-makes cheesy, eye-popping 3D effects  flayed bodies, naked breasts, vomit and a severed penis are all flung out of the screen - are an authentic, affectionate throwback to cheapo Cormanesque excess.<br />When an underground earthquake releases shoals of prehistoric piranha into Lake Victoria, local sheriff Julie Forester (Elizabeth Shue) tries in vain to persuade several thousand Spring Break revellers to quit their aquatic hedonism before they become fish food. Meanwhile, her son Jake (Steven R McQueen) has been lured onto a pleasure boat by slimeball porn director Derrick (Jerry OConnell) and busty, bikini-clad star Danni (British glamour model Kelly Brook). Also aboard is nice girl Kelly (Jessica Szohr), on whom Jake has a crush, who ends up licking tequila, salt and lime off the body and lips of Dannis co-star Crystal (real-life porn star Riley Steele). But once the fishy feeding frenzy starts, its human flesh thats on the menu. </p><p>Aja serves up the tongue-in-cheek thrills, CGI-enhanced gore and gratuitous nudity with such unabashed relish that this may prove to be the summers break-out horror hit. There are also nice cameos from Richard Dreyfuss, reprising his Jaws role, and Hostel director Eli Roth, who completely loses his head after hosting a wet T-shirt contest. A guilty pleasure? Guilty as charged.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Shes 40, broody and single, so TV production assistant Jennifer Aniston decides to have a child via a sperm donor. As the title pretty much gives away, complications with two different helpings of man-seed lie ahead. But what the title and marketing dont tell you is that Aniston is essentially a secondary character. The focus is actually on her unattached best friend Jason Batemans discovery that he may not be much of a lover but hes a great father. Curiously, he comes on like a latterday Tony Randall, a charming neurotic seemingly at the closeted end of the asexual spectrum. Batemans performance  as a broker shedding his anxious reserve when its his turn to look after Anistons melancholy little boy (Thomas Robinson, a real discovery)  is funny, touching and observed in micro-detail throughout.<br />Like the directing duos 2007 ice-skating frolic Blades of Glory, the film consequently dangles uneasily between quirky and mainstream. Josh Gordon and Will Speck treat the central switcheroo narrative like the chore it is and can do little with the grinding plot mechanics that turn Aniston and her donor-of-choice (Patrick Wilson) into cardboard cyphers. When Bateman and Robinson are on screen, though, its a different movie, striking a witty note of nervy authenticity as two misfit males from different generations care and share together. With Jeff Goldblum chiming in usefully as Batemans sardonic boss, theres much to enjoy, if not quite enough to disguise the films essential awkwardness in trying to cover too many bases.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This psychodrama takes place in a hotel, and the feel of the film is dominated by the sense of both distance and closeness between things happening in different parts of it. Bancroft is the singer in the hotel bar, who breaks up with Widmark's airline pilot because he doesn't have 'an understanding heart'. Encountering the mentally disturbed Monroe babysitting in a guest's bedroom, Widmark goes through rapid (!) personal growth (he <i>cares</i>), which makes him ultimately worthy of his girlfriend. The plot is so simple that psychological interest is needed to sustain it, and this would require stronger performances than those Widmark and Monroe give. The film's most powerful effect is the play-off between sound and image in hotel geography (Monroe and Widmark speak on the phone across a courtyard; Bancroft's singing is switched on via internal radio, in counterpoint with visual cuts to the bar), which provides a coherence lacking in the emotional drama.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Disney animation enters the '90s, embraces the stunning technical advances of computer-generated imagery, and updates the traditional dependent heroine. Belle, besides representing a move away from the usual Barbie Doll looks, is resourceful, bookish, and vigorous in resisting the chauvinist advances of Gaston, the character who turns out to bear the true mark of the beast. Gaston was based on LA's Medallion Man narcissists, and is well and truly lampooned in the barroom waltz. Beast, based on a menagerie of brooding buffalo, bear, boar and gorilla, learns to master his temper, and his growing relationship with Belle is infinitely touching. His bewitched castle is enlivened by an antic household including a candelabra with the panache of a French matre d', a neurotic clock, and a mother-and-son teapot and cup. The six musical numbers either reveal character or push the action, with 'Be Our Guest' an outstanding example of cartoon choreography. Dazzlingly good.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Scott Pilgrim vs the World might be a US studio movie and have cost more than three times the combined budgets of Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, but for British director Edgar Wright its no huge leap from Spaced, the 90s TV series which made his name, to this. Like Spaced, Scott Pilgrim trades in the messy lives of twentysomething slackers and springs from the world of the comic book. The characters in Spaced often felt like they tripped off the pages of a graphic novel (and Simon Peggs Tim was a fledgling comic artist), while the original Scott Pilgrim was the hero of a six-volume Canadian comic-book series published between 2004 and this year.<br />Scott Pilgrim also has a similar relationship to realism and fantasy as Spaced: what we get are down-to-earth observations on everyday lives explained with wild flights of visual and narrative fancy, with plenty of nods to films and TV shows, loud music and daring edits.<br />Whether you like or just admire Scott Pilgrim will probably rest with how you feel about Scott, as played by Hollywoods favourite nerd, Michael Cera. Scott is the 22-year-old jobless bass player in a garage band called Sex Bob-omb and is the kind of role that Cera regularly plays. But hes also likeable, adorable at times, and free of the super-cool jive-talking that mars films like Juno. Hes self-centred and emotionally childish, but no more, we think, than most of us, and we enjoy the company of his friends, especially his vicious gay flatmate (Kieran Culkin). It means that when the frosty, unreachable Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) enters his life and he gives his try-hard younger girlfriend Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) the brush-off, were running along with him.<br />Which is handy because most of the film invites us to take a trip in Scotts head, a place heavily influenced by computer games.Ramona warns that hell have to defeat her seven evil exes before they can get together  a classic gaming challenge  but the way the film flows between dream and reality, straight drama and crazy flourishes, makes it clear that its mostly happening in Scotts mind. <br />And so the seven battles come one by one, complete with on-screen point scoring like an arcade game. Two fights stand out: Scotts showdown with Lucas Lee (Chris Evans), a film star making a movie in Toronto, and his dispersal of a vegan rock star (Brandon Routh). The later battles are a bit less engaging, and its a relief when one of Scotts adversaries turns out to be two: a pair of twins.<br />Scott Pilgrim feels like Ghost World in its honouring of young people with spikey, interesting personalities. There are hints of Woody Allen in its navel-gazing. And theres a dash of The Matrix in its sneaky affection for pyrotechnics. It could have been a noisy, flashy mess, but luckily its got heart, which makes it feel fun and unique, and more like a lo-fi, endearing mess instead.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Lang's most austere film, reducing the characters to pawns arbitrarily shifted in demonstration of a fascinating theorem. Andrews plays a writer who plans, with the cooperation of a newspaper publisher, to discredit the concept of capital punishment: by deliberately implicating himself as a murderer, he will prove the ease with which circumstantial evidence can lead to wrongful conviction. But after he is duly convicted, the publisher (his sole confidant) is accidentally killed and evidence of the plan destroyed. Despite the ingenious/ingenuous twist that ensues, the film is not concerned with innocence or guilt but with demonstrating that justice, finally, lies in the hand of fate. Not a forthcoming film, but one which repays attention.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Daniel Stamms frustrating faux-documentary about a charlatan exorcist confronted by a seemingly genuine case of demonic possession sustains its intriguing conceit until the last ten minutes, when a contrived generic ending pops up out of nowhere and erases all of its troubling ambiguities. Its a crushing disappointment as the intimate immediacy of the preceding scenes is emotionally involving, psychologically disturbing and often downright terrifying.<br />The Reverend Cotton Marcus, a charismatic evangelical preacher who has lost his faith, invites a documentary film crew to record and expose the truth about his final exorcism. Even when confronted by 16-year-old Nell, the daughter of a fundamentalist Louisiana farmer, the lapsed believer is sceptical: fragile and naive, Nell appears more psychologically distressed than demonically possessed. Since the death of her mother six years before, Nell has been locked way by her strict father and fiercely protective brother. There are whispers about a secret boyfriend and a faint suspicion of incest but Nell is initially calmed by the reverends hollow religious ministrations. Then the demons return with a vengeance. <br />The credibility of faux-documentary filmmaking relies on clear plotting and convincing, semi-improvised acting. German-born director Stamm is well served in both departments: Huck Botko and Andrew Garlands script toys with our scepticism, assumptions and fears, and Ashley Bell, as the shockingly feral Nell, and Patrick Fabian, as the charming showman priest, are both utterly believable. Sadly, the promise of the initial set-up and the atmospheric intensity of the central scenes are squandered by the ending.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It's easy to see the attraction of a film about Frida Kahlo. The Mexican painter was spirited, rebellious, proudly true to her idiosyncratic talents, and, despite being crippled in a bus accident, she led an unusually eventful life. Just the ingredients for a romantic inspirational drama! Or for a thin string of colourful clichs. That's far too harsh an assessment of Hayek's well meaning hymn to the determination and artistic originality of a national heroine, but it does point up the weaknesses of the film. Notwithstanding an eagerness to display her bust at regular intervals, the actress/producer makes for an efficient lead, and the same is true of Molina's Diego Rivera. Kahlo's relationship with the womanising muralist is the movie's backbone, as opposed to the link between experience and art, which is stated, not dramatised. The script rushes events, races past characters, deploys welcome animation and special effects for dreams, trips abroad and paintings come to life. It also fields irritatingly cute cameos. Those unfamiliar with Kahlo's life and work will find it lively and informative, but depth of character and insights into the creative process aren't part of the hagiographic equation.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This slight documentary about ballet dancing Brazilian slum teens is being pitched as the real Billy Elliot, but its a more complex, less satisfying tale than that . These kids arent desperately dancing their way out of the ghetto  in fact, they seem barely aware of their impoverished roots, drifting along in a haze of professional focus and adolescent self-absorption. Which may be great for a ballet dancer, but its tough on an audience: the first rule of documentary must be to find relatable characters, but director Beadie Finzi rarely gets close to her subjects. As a peek into an elite, guarded world, Only When I Dance is fascinating, though its hard to believe professional ballet still unironically employs teenage boys in glitter. Its also a compelling underdog story: however distant these kids seem, you still want them to succeed. Its just a shame Finzi couldnt find a way to get under their skin.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Crowned 'The Worst Film Ever Made' at New York's Worst Film Festival in 1980, this deserves its niche in history for featuring the last screen performance of Bela Lugosi, as a ghoul resurrected by space visitors for use against scientists destroying the world with their nuclear tests. Two minutes of Lugosi in his Dracula outfit, shot for another Wood film abandoned when Lugosi died, are supplemented by footage of an unemployed chiropractor hired as a double; a good foot taller than Lugosi, he of course keeps his face wrapped in a cape. But that's nothing: we also learn that top-level Pentagon offices are furnished with one lamp and two telephones each, while the bedroom furniture of one character is exactly the same as his patio furniture of the previous scene. It all ends with famous psychic Criswell asking the audience, 'Can you prove it didn't happen? God help us in the future'. Prophetic.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A sprawling, discursive fresco: three stories bookended by a prologue and epilogue. In the first story, a mobster (Travolta) is charged with looking after the irresponsible wife (Thurman) of his vengeful boss. In the second, a washed-up boxer (Willis) tries to trick the Mob by failing to throw a fight. And in the third, two hitmen (Travolta and Jackson) carry out a job, only to call on the services of a 'cleaner' (Keitel) when it gets messier than planned. It's the way Tarantino embellishes and, finally, interlinks these old chestnuts that makes the film alternately exhilarating and frustrating. There's plenty of sharp, sassy, profane dialogue, and there are plenty of acute, funny references to pop culture, though the talk sometimes delays the action, and the references sometimes seem self-consciously arch. And there are, too, the sudden lurches between humour and violence - shocking, but without moral depth. What writer/director Tarantino lacks, as yet, is the maturity to invest his work with anything that might provoke a heartfelt emotional response to his characters. Very entertaining, none the less.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Perhaps the funniest, certainly the fastest talkie comedy ever made, this inspired adaptation of Hecht and MacArthur's <i>The Front Page</i> adds an extra dimension of exploitation by turning Hildy Johnson into Walter Burns' ex-wife. Grant's Burns performs astonishing feats of super-quick timing as he garrulously manipulates a gallows case - Qualen, a simpleton mercilessly jailed for killing a black policeman - to further his own ends: first, to win back his wife from staid insurance salesman Bellamy (wonderfully slow in gumboots and bovine smile); second, to win back his star reporter (Hildy again); and third, to beat the rival rags to the full story of the political corruption that casts a shadow over the judicial system demanding Qualen's death. But Grant is not alone in his masterly expertise: Charles Lederer's frantic script needs to be heard at least a dozen times for all the gags to be caught; Russell's Hildy more than equals Burns in cunning and speed; and Hawks transcends the piece's stage origins effortlessly, framing with brilliance, conducting numerous conversations simultaneously, and even allowing the film's political and emotional thrust to remain upfront alongside the laughs. Quite simply a masterpiece.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Engrossing adaptation of HG Wells' tale of a scientist made invisible by his experiments with the drug monocaine. The megalomania that ensues upon Rains' ability to go about unseen is played for suspense, pathos and tongue-in-cheek humour (he can't go out in the rain, because it would make him look like a ridiculous bubble). The real strengths of the movie are John P Fulton's remarkable special effects (Rains removing his bandages to reveal nothing, footsteps appearing as if by magic in the snow), lending much-needed conviction to the blatant fantasy; and the fact that we never see the scientist without his bandages until the very end of the film. No wonder Karloff, disdainful of a role in which he would for the most part only be heard, turned down the part; but Rains, with his clear, sensitively inflected voice, was lucky: it made him a star.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>**** (Four stars)<br />This thoughtful documentary by Kristy Guevara-Flanagan and Dawn Valadez invites you to step right back into the painfully awkward world of puberty and middle school. Just what you want, right? The film is excruciating at times, as it follows four racially diverse urban California girls from varied backgrounds over a period of three years, from fifth to seventh grade. Most of the wincing comes from familiar scenarios, like exclusion from playground cliques and name-calling, but some of the pain emanates from less usual tales. Young Rosie suffers anxiety thanks to an obese mother who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, while Esmerelda must rise daily at 3am to get a ride to class from her school-janitor father. Rest assured, its not all depressing. On the contrary, it is a rare and frequently inspiring close-up on girls who are at an age that is usually quite impenetrable to adults.<i>Beth Greenfield, Gay &amp; Lesbian editor</i></p><p><i>[This is a </i>TONY<i> staff review, written for the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival.

The theme of the group of professionals coming together to defend a cause or undertake a useless task, mainly as an exercise for their narcissistic talents, was one that would be constantly reworked during the '60s. Numerous set pieces, like Coburn's knife fight, Vaughn's fly-catching and McQueen's jokes, stay lodged in the mind.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Although in criticising Russell's lack of discipline people tend to forget that he was virtually the first film-maker to escape the strictures of realism and telestyle that have dogged British cinema since the heyday of Powell and Pressburger, it must nevertheless be admitted that watching his more excessive movies tends to be a wearisome experience. The Who's ludicrous rock opera was in fact tailor-made for the baroque, overblown images and simplistic symbolism of Russell's style, which only means that this is both the movie in which he is most faithful to the ideas and tone of his material, and one of his very worst films.]]></review>

Most of the gags are either incredibly obvious or depressingly scatological, or both.

Shes been seeing Aldous Snow (Brand), the alarmingly limber lead singer of a band called Infant Sorrow, which means the synths Peter has provided for her <i>CSI</i>-like show now seem rather quaint by comparison. Peter gets away from it all by jetting to Sarahs favorite vacation spot in Hawaiiwhich naturally leads to an awkward run-in with the two lovebirds. Rebound romance with a hotel receptionist (Kunis) cant be far behind.</p><p>Too much time in the sun breeds laziness, and <i>Sarah Marshall</i> has a structural laxness that befits its setting, as if no one got around to trimming the outtakes. (When the parts dont fit, Stoller simply cuts to a born-again couple going at it.) Some of the randomness sticks: Rudds terminally blitzed surfing instructor is a riot, and its difficult to avoid a spit-take during a scene from Peters Dracula rock opera. Other curveballs merely feel random. Dont tell me I didnt try, Sarah cries to Peter, in what seems like a calculated retort to the charges of male-centrism that greeted <i>Knocked Up</i> and <i>Superbad</i>; its actually just a down payment on Sarahs eventual shaming. Regarding the material that didnt work, Stoller should have taken Rudds characters advice: When life gives you lemons, just fuck the lemons and bail. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A scarifyingly grim and grimy account of an alcoholic writer's lost weekend, stolen from time intended to be spent on taking a cure and gradually turning into a descent into hell. What makes the film so gripping is the brilliance with which Wilder uses John F Seitz's camerawork to range from an unvarnished portrait of New York brutally stripped of all glamour (Milland's frantic trudge along Third Avenue on Yom<i> </i>Kippur in search of an open pawnshop is a neo-realist <i>morceau d'anthologie</i>) to an almost Wellesian evocation of the alcoholic's inner world (not merely the justly famous DTs hallucination of a mouse attacked by bats, but the systematic use of images dominated by huge foreground objects). Characteristically dispassionate in his observation, Wilder elicits sympathy for his hero only by stressing the cruelly unthinking indifference to his sickness: the male nurse in the alcoholic ward gleefully chanting, 'Good morning, Mary Sunshine!', or the pianist in the bar leading onlookers in a derisive chant of 'somebody stole my purse' (to the tune of 'Somebody Stole My Gal') after he is humiliatingly caught trying to acquire some money. A pity that the production code demanded a glibly unconvincing ending in which love finds a way.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Dont be fooled by the sublime surface beauty of this dour, impenetrable drama from Hungarian Kornl Mundrucz, as this is a film that glides along on the strength of shots and scenes rather than ideas and plausibility. An introspective, hirsute man returns to his mother, who is married to another man. Theres no room in the house, so he elopes with his spindly sister and together they begin the arduous task of constructing a new dwelling in the middle of the Danube. As the bond between the pair becomes too strong to suppress, the scruffy, brandy-swilling locals (who look like theyve been drafted in from a Bla Tarr movie) become wary of the couples odd endeavour. Mundrucz generates a moderate amount of intrigue from the build-up but stubbornly resists handling his themes in any direct and digestible fashion. Instead he opts for oblique plotting and portentous (often biblical) imagery to drag his film across the finishing line.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2009 Venice Film Festival</i><br />Recalling the rueful but sweet-natured tenor of Robert Altmans fond adieu to a long established radio show in A Prairie Home Companion, French New Wave alumnus Jacques Rivette offers a ramshackle road trip across Frances Languedoc region with an underperforming circus troupe in his effervescent miniature, 36 Vues du Pic Saint Loup. Both films are, in a sense, ghost stories, as Rivette depicts the painful memories of departed lovers hovering in the air, as well as the emptiness of the big top as performers happily play out their act to rows of empty stools.<br />Very loosely based on the life of dandy author Raymond Roussel, the story sees well-to-do Italian drifter Vittorio (Sergio Casteilito) deciding to trail a small circus as it ambles through a series of bijou French villages that satellite the titular Pic Saint Loup. Kate (Jane Birkin) is the ringmaster of sorts, who instead of trying to coax townsfolk into seeing the shows, spends time making fruit salads to reward those who come of their own accord. An awkward romance develops between the pair, but the confident, mysterious Vittorio, struggling to work out why Kate is always so distant with him, soon learns of a terrible accident that befell her ex-lover, Peter.<br />Rivette has acknowledged that the idea for the film came about while he was making La Belle Noiseuse in 1991, and this new work displays a similar curiosity not only about the details of how art comes into being, but how it effects those performing or creating it. Three clowns perform an opening comedy skit involving smashed plates and catching bullets in their teeth, and throughout the film Rivette demonstrates how the sketch progresses and develops along with the oscillating moods (and in one case, levels of sobriety) of its performers.<br />Though often wryly amusing, the overriding feeling is one of sadness as the humble art of live performance slowly slips away, and the technologies and responsibilities of the modern age encroach. Perhaps the film is also an allegory for the passing of a time when cinematic spectacle was a simple pleasure born of people with dexterity, charisma and passion for performing for the camera. There are also a few self-effacing nods to the usefulness of criticism, as Vittorio confuses a trapeze artist by describing her act as aerial, yet in offering simple analysis of the comic potential of holding a plate, helps a clown to develop his act.<br />Wittily composed and edited, and shot through with genuine adoration for the landscape and culture of his homeland, '32 Vues du Pic Saint Loup' shows Rivette developing charming, unique variations on all his pet themes. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Acted by an avant-garde theatre group, conceived and directed by one-time kabuki female impersonator Kinugasa, <i>A Page of Madness </i>remains one of the most radical and challenging Japanese movies ever seen here. An old sailor works as a janitor in an asylum to stay close to his insane wife and to help her to escape, except that she doesn't want to go... Kinugasa deploys a battery of expressionist distortions and otherwise stylised images to plunge his audience into 'irrational' experience, always withdrawing to a 'saner' perspective, and then undercutting that with another visual or dramatic shock. This version has music added by Kinugasa when he rediscovered the print in 1970.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Perhaps Borzage's greatest film, <i>Moonrise</i>, a brooding tale of a murderer's son (Clark) driven to violence by others harping on his past, is the perfect answer to those critics who have derided Borzage as a 'mere' romantic, a mere celebrator of the magic of love. Deeply melancholic, the film (from a novel by Theodore Strauss) creates a sense of physical reality with its low key lighting and harsh compositions that Borzage's lovers on the run cannot defeat: their 'Seventh Heaven' in an abandoned mansion is only temporary.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Starting from an implausible conceit - Arkansas firemen Paxton and Sadler lay their mitts on a map to stolen gold possibly hidden in a derelict East St Louis factory - this concerns the greedy pair's attempts to escape, alive and much the richer, from a black drugs gang who use the building for making deals and dumping corpses. Cue stereotyped characters, lashings of violence, fallings-out in the rival camps (with crack-king Ice T facing challenges from would-be usurper Ice Cube), and a tortuous plot that spirals inexorably from the ingenious to the ludicrously overblown. Everything subscribes to the modish: the moral cynicism, the superfluous use of video, the rap soundtrack, the flip aftermath to the fiery carnage of the finale. Perhaps that's the result of an uneasy meeting of disparate talents: scriptwriters Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis are known for frantic action and slick twists, Hill (at least in his early, better films) for laconic, mythic heroes, pared-down plotting and sudden bursts of violence. For the undemanding, it may seem a fair stand-off; but compared to Hill's best work, it's merely a jerk-off.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Watch our video interview with Cassel </i><br />Vincent Cassel snarls and swaggers his way into the acting big league with a lapel-grabbing central turn in this arresting, two-part French true-crime biopic (the second instalment opens on August 28). As Jacques Mesrine  the jail-springing, wife-beating, bank-robbing, kidnapping, Arab-hating, anti-establishment poster boy of post-war France (whos also quite handy in the kitchen)  Cassel injects a jolt of wild energy and ambiguity into what could easily have been another flatulent, apologist gangster epic.<br />We open on a portentous title card declaring that any mans life is too varied to be caught on film. The movie traces Mesrines rise up the criminal ranks in his home town of Clichy, outside Paris, in the 1960s. The heat builds and he flees to America and is extradited to French Canada where he pulls off a dashing escape from a brutal maximum-security prison in 1972.  <br />The filmmakers offer us a splintered, contradictory portrait of a man who we see one moment calmly accepting his redundancy from an architecture firm and the next forcing a pistol into his wifes mouth. Yes, Cassel has bagged the Jekyll and Hyde role that used to be reserved for Joe Pesci, but he plays it with a touch more depth, compassion and self-awareness. <br />On the downside, theres a feeling that every scene strains to make a point. In one sweep, the film blames Mesrines behaviour on his brutal experiences in Algeria (where he assisted in torture), his over-lenient parents and the instability of the labour market. Yet, as the film gallops forward, a more interesting conflict develops, and our early reading of Mesrine as an over-confident, trigger-happy jester has to be rethought. This is in no small part down to Cassels textured and charismatic performance.<br />The pacing of the film is breakneck: scenes are so short that potentially fruitful characters like  Mesrines rotund point man, Guido (Grard Depardieu), and his kindly first wife, Sofia (Elena Anaya), get short shrift. The direction, too, from Jean-Franois Richet (Assault on Precinct 13), is no-frills  the action is rudimentary and some moments resemble a TV movie.<br />But the cosmetic aspects of the film matter little: Mesrine is about the personal ramifications of a life in crime. Its about the inner loneliness of a mobster, the paranoia and pride that make if tough, even dangerous, to rely on associates and friends and how a simple public display of violence is all it takes to overtake your peers on the highway of immorality.<br /><i>Watch our video interview with Cassel </i>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA['Gleaming the cube' is the term applied for that moment when pirouetting skateboarders momentarily leave the ground to carve their way through the air. It's the type of thing rebel without a high school diploma Brian (Slater) loves to do, much to his parents' despair. But he's first to rally to their cause when tragedy strikes, getting his act together to take the law into his own hands. According to the hackneyed conventions of this so-so thriller, this involves ridding himself of tatty clothes and stubble. He delves into the Orange County underworld, which is racier than you might think. The Vietnamese community is up to no good, with corruption infiltrating a seemingly respectable medical supply business. Slater and Le Tuan (as a Vietnamese ex-colonel) put in decent performances, but the best moments come from the action sequences in which Brian and his buddies perform their sporty feats. But with the screenplay dabbling with too many issues and stereotypes, the characters are largely one-dimensional and the relationships unconvincing.]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[Lebanon]]></name>
      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[Strange to say it, but Lebanon is this weeks second-best Israeli film (see also Eyes Wide Open'). Its also the picture that won the Golden Lion at last years Venice Film Festival, putting it up there with the likes of The Battle of Algiers, Rashomon and, more recently, Vera Drake and Brokeback Mountain. The comparison may not be entirely fair, but such an award does raise expectations and its worth warning that while Samuel Maozs Lebanon is to be recommended as a distinctive, personal memoir of what it was like to be a young, fearful soldier and inhabit the hellish confines of a tank during the 1982 Lebanon War, its also a patchy, difficult work that often feels oddly academic and distant rather than truly surprising and involving. <br />Which is not to say that Lebanon isnt an interesting experiment, not least in how to recreate war on a low budget and to avoid the predictable narratives, back stories and emotional flashpoints of so many conflict tales. Maoz plunges us straight into the action at 3am on June 6 1982, the first day of the Lebanon war as Israel invades its neighbour. The first and last shots of the film show us the exterior of the tank, but the rest of the narrative is set entirely within the vehicle, only showing us the situation outside through its periscope. As formal handcuffs go, these are tight  but I couldnt help feeling that Maoz cheats at his own game a little. His viewfinder is strangely attuned to giving us emotive money shots, be they of a dying donkeys nostrils still breathing or a naked woman running around among bombed-out ruins.<br />Inside the tank, though, his vision of hell is truly effective. Claustrophobia, part-knowledge, confrontation and an eerie sense of isolation are the name of the game as the tank encounters gun and rocket fire, negotiates a ruined town by day and night and suffers damage of increasing severity. Comradeship barely figures as the tanks occupants  three young lads, Shmulik (Yoav Donat), Hertzel (Oshri Cohen) and Yigal (Michael Moshonov), under the command of the not-much-older Assi (Itay Tiran)  are driven by the individualism of fear. Heroism and self-sacrifice, so often the twin clichs of war films, are irrelevant. Barely emerging from the shadows, the four men negotiate smoke, oil, water and urine  not to mention an abundance of croutons (their issued snack) sprayed over the festering walls of the tank. <br />Lebanon is a film of randomly emerging episodes, some more successful than others. A sequence in which the tank confronts an armed man holding a family hostage feels contrived and designed too obviously as a moment of terror, while Yigals request that his superiors call his parents to assure them hes safe feels similarly misjudged. Two stronger sequences stick in the mind: Shmuliks inability to pull the trigger when faced with an enemy for the first time and the tanks reckless, nocturnal drive through the city.<br />Lebanon treads similar territory to Ari Folmans Waltz with Bashir, another work from a filmmaker who fought in the Lebanon War and is only now able to distil his memories into entertainment. But Maoz prefers straight, undignified reconstruction to telling a story through the prism of memory. His aim is admirable, his project intriguing and his film a fair testament to the nightmare of war  but it never feels as convincing or as suffocating as it should.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[On-off couple Drew Barrymore and Justin Long bring plenty of spark to this irreverent romcom. Barrymores Erin is a would-be journo who meets Longs Garrett during an internship in New York. After she returns to Chicago, they decide to try a long-distance relationship. <br />Whats both refreshing and problematic is that theres no emotional imbalance between boy and girl: their feelings are mutual and the obstacle is purely geographical. Their chemistry and mischievous banter are fun, but the story offers little tension and eventually becomes repetitive. <br />Luckily, the characters have bags of charm: both work hard, play hard and give as good as they get. The night they meet, Garretts flatmate plays 80s love songs through the wall as a soundtrack to their hook-up. Erin feigns offence, but thinks its hilarious. <br />The scene is set for a fun-loving courtship with amusing sidekicks: Christina Applegate is good as Erins sister, while Jason Sudeikis is great as Dans brash mate. It may tire before the finish line, but Going the Distance is still good for a giggle.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The first of three adaptations of Somerset Maugham's novella (the others were Lewis Milestone's <i>Rain</i> and Curtis Bernhardt's <i>Miss Sadie Thompson</i>), Walsh's late silent movie profited from the absence of dialogue to avoid some of the inevitable censorship problems. Sadie, a prostitute escaping prosecution in San Francisco, lands up on a South Pacific island where she finds a sympathetic sailor lover (played by Walsh himself), but is threatened with deportation by a reformer - a priest in the novella - whose feelings towards her are not entirely spiritual. Walsh's version is high on atmosphere and vitality, though sadly the final reel has been lost, and a restoration has had to resort to stills to reach the conclusion.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[First in the wondrous series of B movies in which Val Lewton elaborated his principle of horrors imagined rather than seen, with a superbly judged performance from Simon as the young wife ambivalently haunted by sexual frigidity and by a fear that she is metamorphosing into a panther. With its chilling set pieces directed to perfection by Tourneur, it knocks Paul Schrader's remake for six, not least because of the care subtly taken to imbue its cat people (Simon, Russell) with feline mannerisms. Its sober psychological basis is barely shaken by the studio's insistence on introducing, as a stock horror movie ploy, a shot of a black panther during one crucial scene.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Reviewed at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival</p><p>Though hes been making films for nearly three decades, its only in the last five years that the work of Hong Kongs Johnnie To has become fashionable at the major European film festivals. His latest, therefore, looks like a somewhat deliberate attempt to court the French market, given that it stars ageing pop-idol-turned-movie-star Johnny Hallyday as a man who arrives in Macao to visit his daughter (Sylvia Testud), who lost her husband and children when gangsters burst, guns blazing, into their apartment during the brief pre-credits sequence. She, having survived the carnage with appalling injuries and barely a single scene left to appear in, asks Costello (for such, a tad unsurprisingly, is his name) to wreak vengeance on the culprits, a task which he, as someone who worked (again a little unsurprisingly) as a hitman before setting himself up in the Champs-Elyses restaurant business, is unusually willing and able to take on.<br />If indeed there is anything surprising about this clich-packed genre fare, its the degree to which To and his screenwriter Wai Ka-Fai are prepared to indulge their flair for the ludicrous. As Costello employs the services of three (purportedly) likeable hitmen to help him track down and kill the men who offed his son-in-law and grandkids, the film steers consistently clear of anything remotely realistic or gritty, revelling instead in plot developments, dialogue and action sequences as flagrantly absurd as theyre stylish. Nothing whatsoever rings true: not the cheap Chilean plonk Costello (apparently a great chef and wealthy bon vivant) serves up when he hires his trio of goons, not the bizarre means (involving scouts and stick-on paper flags) by which the villainous Mr Big is entrapped, not the shoot-outs and most definitely not Hallydays face, a strangely elongated, unevenly wrinkled, tiny-eyed affair that barely resembles the appearance of your average human. To call the film cartoon-like would be to do a grave disservice to the majority of comic strips. <br />That said, its far from unenjoyable (though Im not sure this kind of fluff really warrants a place in Cannes main competition). At a fairly pacy108 minutes it doesnt outlast its welcome, especially when you can feast your eyes on such marvellously idiotic imagery as Hallyday praying (altogether incredibly given his actions throughout the movie) first on a beach and then up to his neck in water. It also looks quite good in a trite, glossy and bombastic kind of way, and there are even a number of funny moments that were actually intended as such. Or so one can only hope. <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The title suggests an intimate meeting of the ruler and the ruled as in The Last King of Scotland, but Robert Mugabe only appears in news clips in this very local and often suffocating documentary portrait of a disappearing way of life in Zimbabwe, filmed in secret and under threat of violence. The filmmakers spend ample time with one family of white farmers, the Campbells, who are fighting to keep their property in the face of the Zanu PF governments decision to redistribute land and execute that ruling by force.<br />The films strength lies in its fearless reportage: the filmmakers are present at some extraordinary events, from the arrival of a ministers son to confiscate the land (and his vitriolic speech about Europeans) to the familys various and often futile trips to a regional court in Namibia to seek legal help against the proposed confiscation of their property. The sense of violence, real and threatened, is terrifying, although footage of the Campbells relatives living in comfort in rural Kent is a sobering reminder that white Africans with some wealth and European links, such as the Campbells, ultimately have more chance of an alternative way of life than the black Zimbabweans who work for them.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This is a brutal, mesmerising film from Dane Nicolas Winding Refn (Pusher, Bronson), dominated by Mads Mikkelsen as a mute fighter, whose journey from twelfth-century Scotland to a strange New World is an odyssey of self-realisation. Enslaved by a pagan Scottish clan chieftain, the nameless warrior is chained and forced to fight to the death in hand-to-hand bouts staged for amusement and betting. Escaping with the help of a young boy, who names him One-Eye, the warrior learns to use weapons and joins a band of Vikings, but these are Christian converts bound for Jerusalem to reclaim the city for their faith. Their ship, however, is enveloped by a mysterious mist, which finally lifts to reveal an unknown land. Lost, hungry and under attack from the natives, the Viking converts lose their faith and lose their minds, turning on one another  but the enigmatic One-Eye discovers his destiny and embraces his essential self. <br />There are shades here of Terrence Malicks elemental feel for landscape, the doomed colonial enterprise of Werner Herzogs Aguirre, Wrath of God and Vincent Wards visionary The Navigator: A Medieval Odyssey, yet Refn makes this hypnotic, dreamlike film entirely his own. The pace slows like a fighters heart in the second half, demanding an act of faith that some may find hard after the early intensity. But the breathtaking digital photography and an atmospheric electronic score sustain the mood, and for those who see this savage journey through to the end, there are riches aplenty.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Director Biberman, producer Paul Jarrico, writer Michael Wilson, composer Sol Kaplan and actor Will Geer were all blacklisted at the time, and this extraordinary film was a unique act of defiance. Production was subject to constant FBI harassment, the leading actress was repatriated to Mexico (shots of her final scenes were done surreptitiously), and projectionists refused to screen the finished film, which <i>still</i> looks incredibly modern. Financed by the American mineworkers union, it deals with a strike in the New Mexico community of Zinc Town, formerly San Marcos. While the Anglo workers enjoy reasonable living conditions, the Mexicans live without adequate sanitation in a form of apartheid. At pains not to feature traditional romantic leads (like <i>Matewan</i> or <i>The Milagro Beanfield War</i>), it focuses on two decidedly unglamorous people, a Mexican worker (Chacon) and his pregnant wife (Revueltas), who are victims of an economic trap, and whom America's post-war boom - symbolised by the gleaming cars that drive through the picket line - has passed by. As the strike for better conditions progresses, the women play an increasing role, overcoming the traditional macho ethos by doing both picket duty and time in jail (while the men, fed up with washing dishes, go off hunting). The film's targets multiply - workers' rights, racism, feminism - and for 1953 this is pretty amazing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Van Sant's impressive third feature has enough ideas to fill three movies, a plenitude that threatens to blow the film apart (but never does). It's a road movie filmed mainly from the point of view of gay hustler Mike (Phoenix, superb), a narcoleptic who falls unconscious without warning at moments of stress. As Mike tours the Pacific Northwest doing 'dates', he meets up with mayor's son Scott (Reeves), and together they set off in search of Mike's mother. The disconcerting realities of the situation are punctuated by sequences of surreal, dreamlike beauty, 'documentary'-style inserts, and playful variations on Shakespeare, with Scott still playing Prince Hal to the Falstaffian Bob (Richert), a thief and ex-hustler, in the knowledge that he will soon be 'King'. Stunning to look at - the dawn and dusk landscapes are sublime - and seductively scored, the film's uniqueness lies in its remarkable emotional open-heartedness.]]></review>

Four bombed-out astronauts journey endlessly through the galaxy, whiling away the time with jokes, sunlamp treatment, personal diaries on videotape, and games with their own pet alien. Arguably the last great hippy movie with its jokey references to drugs, the Absurd and California surfing (one crew member makes it back to earth on an improvised board), it also anticipates the sci-fi vogue of the '70s (<i>Alien</i> and Carpenter's own gem <i>The Fog</i>) as well as taking a healthy sideswipe at the pretensions of <i>2001</i>. Sheer delight.]]></review>

Minor stuff, if diverting enough in its absurdity (Oberon picking her way through the rubble of Berlin in a series of Orry-Kelly gowns). But the train itself whisks the narrative along, and Tourneur's unflinching stare at postwar devastation owes less to any documentary pretensions that to an almost Langian beadiness of eye.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of the finest mainstream <i>noir</i>-thrillers ever made. As Bogart's Marlowe gets involved with the Sternwood family's many problems (drugs, blackmail, nymphomania and murder), Hawks never allows the plot to get in the way of his real interest: the growing love, based on remarkably explicit sexual attraction, between Bogie and Bacall, and the way that emotion causes both of them to modify their initial positions regarding the criminal goings-on. In fact, the story is virtually incomprehensible at points, but who cares when the sultry mood, the incredibly witty and memorable script, and the performances are so impeccable?]]></review>

This expos of a malicious small town in France must be one of the most depressed films to emerge from the period of the German Occupation: everyone speaks badly of everyone else, rumours of abortion and drug addiction are rife, and a flood of poison-pen letters raises the spiteful hysteria to epidemic level. Clouzot's misanthropy concludes in total defeat; his naggingly over-insistent style occasionally achieves a great blackness.]]></review>

Focusing on adoring niece Wright's dawning realisation that her kind, generous and handsome uncle is in fact a cold and cynical killer, the film is not only psychologically intriguing (both niece and uncle are called Charlie, and he arrives in town as if in answer to her prayers for excitement), but a sharp dissection of middle American life, in its own quiet way an ancestor of <i>Blue Velvet.</i> Is Uncle Charlie all these gentle folk deserve, when adolescent girls dream of the romantic life, and middle-aged men (papa Travers and neighbour Cronyn) endlessly discuss gruesome murder? Funny, gripping, and expertly shot by Joe Valentine, it's a small but memorable gem.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[While Mesrine: Death Instinct chronicled the ascendancy of Vincent Cassels cocksure French crim, Jacques Mesrine, this second chapter ditches the mechanics of his life story in favour of a ruminative, often unsympathetic inspection of his contradictory character traits (as reflected in an ever-changing wardrobe of disguises). The early stages hint at a Heat-like battle of wits between Mesrine and tireless police commissioner Broussard (Oliver Gourmet), but a last-minute escape from justice puts the spotlight back on Cassel. The film continues as a wandering  account of how Mesrines various antics and encounters shaped him as a person. Unlike its more lively predecessor, this is more interested in dissecting the criminal mindset and proposes the theory that the acts of a felon prevent him or her from being able to maintain logical personal and political ideals. In one scene, for example, Mesrine violently forces a family to hide him from the cops, then, the next minute, hes handing over loot in return for their services.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA['Smart, ambitious and hard as a driller's fist.' Add a confident sexuality and ferocity of spirit, and Cherokee Lansing is well in the mainstream of Susan Hayward heroines. One-quarter Indian, Cherokee begins the film seeking revenge on the oil tycoon responsible for her father's death. But along the way she's seduced by the establishment, and becomes Cherry, heedless socialite. Only after ex-boyfriend Armendariz is declared insane for refusing to have more oil wells drilled on his land does our heroine find moral redemption, during a fiery climax. As scripted, this is an unusually fretful gloss on the American Dream. But it takes a worried man to sing a worried song, and Heisler clearly didn't have a worry in the world.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival<br /></i><br />Oliver Stone is back on the trading floor and Michael Douglas is back in the sharp suits for Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, an undisciplined attempt by the director of JFK and W. at resurrecting his 1980s tale for modern times and combining melodrama with up-to-the-minute social and economic commentary. The characterisations are so broad and the plotting so wild that this revival, which is screening out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival, is best viewed as a camp comedy and a knowing in-joke  albeit one that feels the need to plant economics lectures in the mouths of its cast so that it at least sounds like a serious attempt to take the pulse of our times.<br />Jacob (Shia LaBeouf) is a mindful and smart young trader at a Wall Street bank, where he enjoys the support and mentorship of a banking boss of the old school (Frank Langella) and is on the verge of ploughing money into an eco-business hes identified as a safe, responsible investment. But the good vibes cant last. Theres a crash and an aggressive takeover by rival banking boss Bretton James (Josh Brolin, all cigars and motorbikes) sends his mentor tumbling onto the subway tracks and Jacob into Brettons more mercenary hands. The other hitch is that Jacobs leftie girlfriend is Winnie Gekko (Carey Mulligan), estranged daughter of Gordon (Michael Douglas), whos on his way out of jail and not necessarily the reformed character he might appear.<br />There are so many nods to the first movie and weak gags in Stones opportunistic resurrection of his 1987 film that its impossible to take seriously the films attempt to capture the financial zeitgeist. Right from the minute Gekko walks out of prison at the beginning of the film and retrieves an empty money clip and a huge mobile phone from the prison authorities, you know this is going to be an odd mix of a picture, half<br />panto, half drama. You want to shout Behind you! whenever a cigar-chomping, shiny-headed bad banker appears. Brolins Bretton is particularly wide: he owns a grim Goya painting and you expect him to grow horns and start cackling in front of it. <br />LaBeouf is fine as the films calm conscience and Douglas, too, is an amusing presence, not too broad and obviously enjoying himself. The cameos lighten the mood even more: Charlie Sheen pops up as Bud Fox from the first film; Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter plays himself in an especially odd scene; and Stone himself twice rears his head disastrously. Mulligan comes out of the whole thing poorly: her character is a bit of a sourpuss and even though were supposed to feel empathy for her and her values, the film slyly sidelines her as a little too dull for its liking.<br />The style is brash and obvious, as is often Stones habit: when someone tells Jacob, Youve got fight in you!, we actually see the ghost of Langella in his mirror; when Jacob starts talking about the hydrogen-power firm he wants to support, we see all sorts of crass graphics and kids-TV science experiments flashing up on screen.<br />Stones lightweight and soapy film feels like he threw a whole load of newspaper clippings at a tired plot about estranged fathers and a clash of values. The problem with this film is that if you put in front of a bunch of bankers, theyd laugh their heads off and feel a swell of pride at the thought that they inhabit a world as glamorous as that suggested by Stones indulging of the New York skyline and the trappings of excessive wealth. Its hardly satire. This is a pulp novelisation of the banking crisis and its pleas for relevance ring very hollow.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Franchise creator and director of the first film, Paul W S Anderson is back at the helm for the fourth Resident Evil movie, which was shot in 3D but remains just as slickly two-dimensional as its predecessors. Like a multi-levelled computer game, Resident Evil: Afterlife is just a string of self-contained set pieces, starting with an attack on the Umbrella Corporations HQ in Tokyo by the mutated warrior Alice (Milla Jovovich) and a bevy of Alice clones. Stripped of her enhanced physical powers by Umbrella supremo Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), Alice nevertheless escapes to Arcadia, a mythical Alaskan haven from the global zombie plague, and from there to the fire-ravaged ruins of Los Angeles. It is therefore a more human, vulnerable Alice who rescues her old friend Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) and hooks up with a ragtag band of survivors holed up in a zombie-besieged LA prison. Less bleak than Russell Mulcahys post-apocalyptic Extinction, Andersons Afterlife dangles the possibility of salvation. Otherwise, its the same zombie hell, but with evolved flesh-eaters that now have extendable mouth parts and lashing tentacles. Technically, its a considerable achievement, although Andersons use of 3D is often more gimmicky than one might have hoped. Still, for die-hard fans, Afterlife has the same scatter-shot appeal as Alices shotgun full of coins, which she uses to explode the heads of the slavering zombies.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The urge for up-and-coming Hollywood pretty boys to prove their dramatic chops has led to bizarre career U-turns for everyone from Jerry Lewis to Ashton Kutcher, and now it’s the turn of newly minted A-lister Ryan Reynolds, who filled in time between flirting with Sandra Bullock in ‘The Proposal’ and slipping on the emerald tights for forthcoming superhero epic ‘Green Lantern’ by making an entire movie in a seven-by-three-foot box.<br />Reynolds plays Paul Conroy, a US contractor ambushed in Iraq who wakes to find himself six feet underground with only a cellphone and a Zippo. It’s an intriguing set-up, and the early scenes are superbly clammy as Paul deals first with his gruff Iraqi kidnappers and then with the infuriatingly sceptical US authorities, all the while keeping an eye on his dwindling air supply.<br />But writer-director Rodrigo Cortés struggles to maintain the tension, and his desire to appeal to the multiplex crowd leads to some bizarre, incongruous episodes: the sudden appearance of a snake is more laughable than terrifying, while Paul’s teary, Oscar-bait farewell to his geriatric mum feels heavy handed. If Cortés had dialled back the narrative intrigue and audience manipulation in favour of a more grimly realistic approach, ‘Buried’ could have been a bona fide, claustrophobic classic. As it is, this is a solid, unsettling, at times very entertaining thriller – but the jury’s still out on Reynolds.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A fresh-faced toddler and his bashful, semi-estranged father trade hushed life lessons in this gorgeous docu-fiction from Mexican director Pedro Gonzlez-Rubio. Filmed with a skeleton crew (Rubio as cinematographer alongside a single sound man) in the rickety, stilted shacks surrounding the atoll reef of Quintana Roo off the south-east coast of Mexico, this rugged, tranquil film chronicles a rite-of-passage fishing trip the pair takes before the boy is whisked off to Italy with his mother. <br />At first their bond is tacit and undemonstrative, but through various father-son activities  house-painting, cooking, descaling fish  you gradually get a sense of the profound mutual affection they share. Rubio frames the central drama against a sublime natural backdrop, capturing a mesmerising elemental harmony between man and beast. Moving but never sentimental, ambient but rigorously focused, this is an assured, refreshingly simple film where the dramas and responsibilities of parenthood exist inside a bubble of blissed-out tropicalia.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2010 Toronto Film Festival<br /></i><br />Kazuo Ishiguros award-winning novel (the best of the decade, as per Time magazine) is transposed to the screen with something like deference by producer Andrew Macdonald and screenwriter Alex Garland  the team that gave us The Beach; 28 Days Later and Sunshine). <br />The third part of that team, director Danny Boyle, has gone his own way of course, and you wont find any trace of his dynamism in Mark Romaneks cool, self consciously drab compositions and patient, controlled tempo. Its been eight years since Romaneks over-determined thriller One-Hour Photo, and he hasnt loosened up any. <br />The material here is stronger, and his solemnity is hardly misplaced, but it makes for a glum watch. Like the characters, you wind up casting about for even the unlikeliest escape route. A high-brow science fantasy story trimmed of most of the science and keeping the fantasy under lock and key, Never Let Me Go is an artful tease and a tragic romance played out over three decades in an imaginary recent past. <br />At Hailsham, in the late 1970s, Kathy, Tommy and Ruth grow up in a boarding school (or is it an orphanage?) so fiercely protective none of the children has ever set foot outside the grounds. They are schooled in basic social interactions  how to order in a caf for instance  and encouraged to draw and paint, but for what purpose they have only the vaguest idea. Kathy has eyes for Tommy, but her best friend Ruth has her own designs. <br />Ten years later, as teenagers (and now played by Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley), they are permitted to move up to the next stage in their development, entering the world on a day-release basis. By now their fate is becoming clearer  or rather, darker <br />Safe to say the less you know beforehand, the more youll find to chew over. The trouble is, as the film slowly reveals its secrets there is ample time for nagging doubts to gnaw away at its credibility. If Romanek refrains from showing us the big picture, were tempted to fill it up with plot holes. <br />The allegory rings a mite hollow, but the film works quite well as a love story. Mulligan confirms her newly won status with a watchful, still, compassionate performance, and Garfield (and his younger alter-ego, Charlie Rowe) is very touching as the emotionally wide-open Tommy, the apex of the love triangle. In the trickier role of Ruth, Knightley hits the right note of conceited faux-sophistication.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A dissection of life and amorality among the young and disaffected in the late '50s, with Bardot giving her finest ever performance as the girl whose headlong rush from her stiff bourgeois home into a series of frustrating affairs with Parisian intellectuals leads to her trial for murder. Clouzot, the man who made the wonderful but terribly cynical <i>Le Corbeau</i>, <i>The Wages of Fear</i> and <i>Les Diaboliques</i>, is as cold and savage as ever in his observation of French manners, although the courtroom scenes that frame the flashbacks to Bardot's past tend to decrease the tension inherent in the subject. Far from his finest work, but still compelling viewing: compared to Clouzot, even Fassbinder seemed a romantic.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Prosper Mrime's fine old tale of high passions and low morals gets re-upholstered Hollywood-style in Preminger's all-black musical. The cigarette-maker with a rose instead of a fag between her teeth is transformed into Dandridge's parachute factory worker, whose romance with GI Joe (Belafonte) is interrupted by Harlem's equivalent of the toreador - a boxer. Given such a lushly familiar score as Bizet's, the dis, dats and deys with which Oscar Hammerstein liberally sprinkles his lyrics seem oddly fey, even when handled by the competent voices of Marilyn Horne and Laverne Hutchinson. The somewhat heavy-handed direction and the ultimately two-dimensional characters leave you admiring the workmanship without plucking at the necessary emotional/romantic heart-strings.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A rich, romantic take on the <i>wuxia</i>, China's heroic swordsman genre, from the eclectic Ang Lee. The first ten minutes or so offer dense exposition, introducing the legendary and righteous swordsman Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat), his esteemed partner Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) and the wilful young aristocrat Jen (Zhang Ziyi), who enjoys a double life as a thief under the malign tutelage of her governess (Cheng Pei-Pei). They clash over the Green Destiny, a priceless sword which Jen steals as a mark of defiance. Yu gives chase in a brilliantly modulated set-piece across the roof-tops, the women defying gravity in exhilarating leaps and bounds. Once it takes flight the movie never touches the ground, spinning myriad duels of the body and spirit. Ang Lee has always been a director of finesse and fine feeling, but his touch is just as deft even as he extends his grasp to reveal the breathtaking vistas of mythic China, then relaxes enough to stage the demolition of a tavern with slapstick aplomb. Inventively choreographed by Yeun Wo-Ping - of <i>The Matrix</i> fame - the film imbues every look, every gesture with resonance and grace. Sexy and sublime, it's a feast for the senses and 100 per cent sheer cinema.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Stallone certainly has the square jaw-line and iconic presence to play Judge Dredd, a helmeted, emotionless future-cop who dispenses summary justice on the riot-torn streets of Mega City One. When Dredd is falsely convicted of murder and, like his honest mentor Judge Fargo (von Sydow), driven out into the lifeless deserts of the Cursed Earth, the resulting vacuum is filled by corrupt Judge Griffin (Prochnow), who springs Dredd's cloned criminal brother Rico (Assante) from prison and foments social chaos. Dredd, however, is not so easily vanquished and returns to settle old family scores. Indicative of worries that Dredd's heartless, neo-fascistic persona would result in too dark a tone, the uneven script throws in femme cop Hershey (Lane) and irritating side-kick Fergie (Schneider) to add human feeling and comic relief. Despite some fuzzy flying sequences, the precocious technical mastery displayed by 27-year-old Brit director Cannon is extraordinary; but as with his flawed debut, <i>The Young Americans</i>, a question mark still hangs over his handling of actors and narrative fluidity. As a result, this slam-bang Stallone vehicle never quite delivers what its confident, fizzing visuals seem to promise.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[There was talk of Joaquin Phoenix going off the rails  behaving oddly in interviews, checking into rehab  long before news broke that this intimate doc by his brother-in-law, Casey Affleck, charting a whacked-out, hairy and fat Phoenixs withdrawal from acting during 2008 and subsequent laughable attempt to become a rapper, might be a hoax.<br />Whats clear from watching the film, which is presented as an up-close, fly-on-the-wall doc, following Phoenix at home in New York and Los Angeles, is that while its motivations might have been genuine, its execution is wobbly: some scenes, especially those involving Phoenixs antagonistic relationships with his assistants, feel staged, and encounters with the likes of Ben Stiller (offering him a part in Greenberg) and P Diddy (suffering his ambition to make a record) dont feel very real at all. Which means that you spend a lot of time trying to unpick the question of fakery and less time thinking about the issue in hand, which, we imagine, is Phoenixs desire to say something about fame and his role in that game.<br />The hoax issue is a bit of red herring: Phoenix is known for being unable to separate acting and life, and with that in mind Im Still Here is best viewed as a fictional self-portrait. He is giving us a version of himself, real or not, and Affleck is merely a collaborator. The problem is that the portrait that emerges is of a vain man-child, ill at ease with the world and his place in it. It might be honest, but its not pretty. As playful reflections on your own persona go, Banksys Exit Through the Gift Shop trumps this effort by a long way, but its mostly a compelling, teasing watch.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A characteristically pessimistic account of human aspiration from Kubrick, this tripartite sci-fi look at civilisation's progress from prehistoric times (the apes learning to kill) to a visionary future (astronauts on a mission to Jupiter encountering superior life and rebirth in some sort of embryonic divine form) is beautiful, infuriatingly slow, and pretty half-baked. Quite how the general theme fits in with the central drama of the astronauts' battle with the arrogant computer HAL, who tries to take over their mission, is unclear; while the final farrago of light-show psychedelia is simply so much pap. Nevertheless, for all the essential coldness of Kubrick's vision, it demands attention as superior sci-fi, simply because it's more concerned with ideas than with Boy's Own-style pyrotechnics.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>It is a point of fact that Ferrell is 41. Assessing his emotional age from comedy to comedy is also fairly easy: somewhere between squalling infant and terrible two-year-old. (Thats not a criticism; Ferrells tantrums are virtuosic.)</p><p>But <i>Step Brothers</i>, a suburban arrested-development fantasia that actually earns tags like anarchic and subtly subversive, is eerily precise to the degree to which it dates Ferrell and his frizzy-haired <i>Talladega Nights</i> costar, John C. Reilly. As Brennan and Dale, two failure-to-launch shlubs still mooching off their single parents, both seem an especially surly 12old enough to drool over <i>Hustler</i>s in a tree house, young enough to turn weepy at an especially harsh dinnertime insult. We never really learn what dooms them to their lives of rumpus-room romps, Chewbacca masks and bunk beds, but they both seem pretty happy about it, and the spell the film casts is a strange, sweaty one, bordering on psychosis.</p><p>Thats until they find themselves related by marriage, and their ultrasupportive parents (Steenburgen and Jenkins, both superb) gently but firmly ask for a little maturity. <i>Step Brothers</i> runs almost dutifully into the quagmires of predictable narrative; actually, it may be the one skit-type project starring a former <i>SNL</i>er that didnt need a story. Properly, it should cycle endlessly, maddeningly, like a Marx Brothers movie or <i>Bringing Up Baby</i>, from bedroom feud to backyard scrape to garage karaoke-session. The shouty variety of manchild comedy that Ferrell has cribbed from Jerry Lewis divides movie fans intensely. Heres the one we should put in the time capsule. </p>]]></review>

Its superbly edited and shot, Ernest Lehmans script keeps things moving along nicely, the Nazi threat is neatly handled, Andrews makes for a surprisingly determined heroine (even if her aim is merely to care for kids and stand by her man), and Eleanor Parker steals the show.

      <review><![CDATA[Fun. Its a crucial but often overlooked element in a summer blockbuster comic-book adaptation and its in Hellboy by the spadeload. How could it not be when the central figure is a grouchy 60-year-old adolescent seven-foot half-human devil with a giant right arm and woman problems? Heartfelt horror is del Toros stock-in-trade, and Hellboy resounds with the directors glee at being handed the keys and told to cut loose on Mike Mignolas cult comic-book creation. But for all Mignolas vision and del Toros panache, this is Ron Perlmans film: all in red and larger than life (clever photography beating CGI to buggery), he burns up the screen as the eponymous hero. This wisecracking, gun-toting, cigar-chomping, trenchcoat-wearing cross between Humphrey Bogart, Hannibal Smith from The A-Team and Clint Eastwood is a long way from Peter Parker. No navel-gazing identity crisis here; the only concession Hellboy makes to the human world is filing his horns to fit in. <br />As del Toro rips through the opening half-hour exposition, we learn that Hellboy crawled into this world from another dimension during World War II. He now works for the US military alongside scientist and father figure Professor Bruttenholm (John Hurt, a ringer for Hergs Professor Calculus), battling an eternal evil that currently manifests itself in the form of Rasputin, some Nazis and a chilling sand-veined cyborg in a gimp suit. Relishing these absurdities and with no tedious old aunties to accommodate, del Toro gets on with the business of furious entertainment, racking up a sequence of coruscating set-pieces against elaborate, urban-occult backdrops while giving Perlman space to cast a baleful eye over a burgeoning romance between his dream girl (and twisted firestarter) Liz (Selma Blair) and military apparatchik Agent Myers (Rupert Evans). Del Toro, in love with his source but never overawed by it, keeps things moving; Perlman ties it together with some of the driest witticisms this side of Indiana Jones. Like we said: fun.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ford plays a drifting gambler who gets adopted by a German casino owner (Macready) in Buenos Aires, only to become embroiled in a misogynistic mnage--trois with the German and his wife (Hayworth). The script is laced with innuendoes and euphemisms; and Ford finds himself as a character whose sexual attributes are not only ambiguous, but bordering on the perverse as his misogyny gradually gains the upper hand. Never has the fear of the female been quite so intense; and the themes that took wing in this extraordinary piece of cinema finally came to roost in such sexual <i>noirs</i> as <i>Carnal Knowledge </i>and <i>Last Tango in Paris.</i>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It's unfortunate that <i>The Wages of Fear</i> is virtually the only Clouzot film that anyone remembers, since his real background lies in a much more traditional French thriller vein, of which <i>Quai des Orfvres</i> is a fine example. The plot is suitably marginal: a hard-times couple (Blier, Delair) whose marriage is crumbling find themselves implicated in a murder. Clouzot doesn't waste a moment over the rampant implausibilities, but devotes all his energies to a romantically bleak evocation of the low-life settings: run-down music-halls, squalid apartments and gloomy police stations, peopled with lonely hookers, lesbians and pornographers. Jouvet's Maigret-esque cop gets all the best lines, and gives the film its human, tragic focus.]]></review>

Things liven up when Nozomi secretly comes to life, played by Bae Du-na, and starts to live a parallel existence, taking a job in a video shop, exploring the city and learning how to live in the real world. Full marks to Kore-eda for sidestepping sleaze and gimmickry in favour of a goodlooking, tender modern fairytale as he tries his best to share with us Nozomis wonder at seeing the world with fresh eyes. But the sense of whimsy only grows with time as you realise that this is a very slim story and its pleasures are only skin deep.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Though seldom seen now, Antonioni's fourth feature is one of his greatest films, in which diverse plot strands, character psychology, and a masterful control of the camera are perfectly fused. Drawn from Pavese, the story begins when local-girl-made-good Clelia returns to Turin to open a fashion salon, and finds the girl in the hotel room next to her has attempted suicide. This introduces Clelia to a new set of friends, whose various amorous problems become the focus of interest. With two bravura set pieces - a picnic by the sea that foreshadows <i>L'Avventura</i>, and a troubled tea party - Antonioni's intensity and grip, and his vivid portrayal of feminine anxiety in particular, make for a film that has barely dated at all.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>At first glance, you could mistake this for a mainstream Hollywood rom-com: handsome con artist accepts money from rich parents who want him to stand in the way of their beloved daughter and her unsuitable beau. He charms her, she realises she can do better, he invents a sob story about a broken heart and swiftly departs with a wallet full of cash. This, however, is a French film, so theres a blissful lack of Dane Cook types pedalling crude sex gags. Instead, we have the comically talented French thesp Romain Duris as the charming Alex, and Vanessa Paradis as Juliette, his latest mark  a woman who could actually break his heart. Juliette is engaged to a posh Brit, Jonathan (Andrew Lincoln, not great), but her dad objects, and assigns Alex to intervene and pose as her bodyguard.</p><p>Its an instantly amusing set-up: Duris is terrific as the suave trickster assisted by his sister and her husband, a comical duo who set up surveillance devices to research Alexs targets. The opening scene is hilarious: Alex poses as a heartbroken doctor delivering medicine to needy villagers, all of whom are in on the act. For Juliette, he must memorise the Dirty Dancing routine and Wham! lyrics. More farcical laughs come courtesy of Juliettes drunken nympho friend, who inconveniently sets her sights on Alex. Problem is, Alex and Juliette never look like a credible love match. Paradis is an enigmatic presence, her characters true feelings never apparent. When Heartbreaker goes for real romance, it falters. When it goes for laughs, it hits the mark. A mixed bag, then, but still an accessible comedy that outstrips its similarly conceived US counterparts.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Self-defeating as it may seem, some films are simply impossible to review. 'Catfish' is a documentary made by two smug, blissfully self-absorbed New York media twentysomethings about a relationship forged on the internet, but that's as much as can be revealed without giving the movie away. On one level it's a horribly exploitative, intellectually unadventurous and emotionally manipulative trawl through the darker reaches of the social network. On another, it's a gripping, alarming, ultimately devastating portrait of the desperate struggle for meaningful discourse in the modern world. Either way, this is essential viewing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Oregon, 1856: pioneering days. Andrews is the ambitious, self-reliant hero around whom move the weak friend (Donlevy), the sworn enemy (Bond), the more or less right woman (Hayward), and the more or less wrong one (Roc, on leave from J Arthur Rank). The film's unevenness and its fitful progress are characteristic of Tourneur. Hayward looks neglected, Donlevy seems disinclined, Carmichael's songs are pleasant but disruptive, and, at a guess, the writer tried to pack in far too much of a discursive novel (by Ernest Haycox). Against all that is the director's talent for the eloquent vignette, the way his characters from time to time convey an unexpected delicacy of feeling and the sense, coherently organised and expressed in the movie, of life as an affair of the temporary and the uncertain. In other words, less for Western buffs than for auteurists and those with a taste for curate's eggs.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Arriving on a wave of opportunistic hype and craven journalism, based on the spurious claim that it cost just 45 to make, Marc Prices first zombie film from a zombies point-of-view has much to live up to. Price admits that the throwaway micro-budget line was designed to lower the expectations of the films target audience  hardcore horror fans. Mainstream audiences will probably be less forgiving of his home movies technical and aesthetic deficiencies.<br />Like its eponymous protagonist, Colin shambles fitfully from one scene to the next, without ever achieving any momentum or sense of direction. Attacked and bitten by a zombie, young Londoner Colin (Alastair Kirton) slowly degenerates into a flesh-eater himself, shuffling about the streets in search of squidgy bits on which to chow down. Later, captured by his sister and her husband, Colin is first strung up and shown familiar photos, then bundled into a sack and taken to his mothers house. In neither case is there even a flicker of human consciousness. Since things tend to happen to the brain-dead Colin, or merely around him, his passive protagonist cannot drive forward what little story there is. Constantly shifting perspectives undermine Prices claim that the action is seen exclusively from Colins point of view, while most of the larger-scale scenes seem designed to give the volunteer extras something to do. </p><p>Colin is promising enough for us to hope that Prices next project will realise his nascent potential. Meanwhile, this overlong, non-frightening debut features ugly digital images that are either over-saturated or absurdly badly lit, and its attempts at leavening humour all fall flat.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Not half bad, despite a loopy plot about a conman/thief hiding from pursuit who kills a look-alike psychiatrist and assumes his identity (conveniently skilled in surgery through interrupted studies, he is even able to reproduce a facial scar). The tension is kept ticking nicely by a flaw in the impersonation (working by mirror, he scars the wrong cheek), even more so by the fact that he unexpectedly inherits dire troubles from the dead man's past. Good supporting performances, a satisfyingly bleak ending, and absolutely stunning lighting and LA location shooting from John Alton.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Matters of the heart, flesh and mind conflict in this thoughtful, tense and saddening study of lust and repression among Jerusalems ultra-Orthodox Jews, a community presented by talented young Israeli director Haim Tabakman as an enclosed and self-regulating bubble. Aaron (Zohar Strauss), a shy butcher, husband and father in his late thirties, reopens his business after his fathers death and accepts Ezri (Ran Danker), a secretive religious student, as an apprentice after the younger man wanders into his shop, reeling from his own, mysterious troubles. <br />Aarons nervous wranglings with scriptural doctrine at local prayer meetings suggest a man ill at ease with himself, while back at the shop Aaron teaches Ezri his trade, lets him sleep in the back room, invites him for meals with his wife and kids and gradually becomes closer to him, much to the dismay of his peers who suggest that he should have nothing to do with the outsider and seem to suspect what we know: that Aaron and Ezri are in a sexual relationship.<br /><br />Tabakmans debut film is a grind at first. Why are we observing these men in this dull shop in this oppressive corner of Jerusalem? What, to be frank, is going on? But as the risk builds, Eyes Wide Open becomes a gripping tale of a man fighting with himself, his community and religion. Tabakman is excellent at capturing both the increasing claustrophobia of the situation and Aarons apparent obliviousness (the oblivion of love?) to whats going on around him, not least with a brilliant shot that captures in the window of a minibus the reflection of a crowd outside Aarons shop.<br /><br />Slow and often silent, its an extraordinarily disciplined film (the photography alone is impressively careful and controlled) that respects, if not honours, the milieu of its story by accepting that liberation has bounds and that leaving it all behind  breaking free  is the stuff of movies, not life.]]></review>

Unashamedly escapist, it rips off most of its plot (from pursuit to final shootout) and much of its visual style from Peckinpah's <i>The Wild Bunch</i>, and even parodies <i>Jules and Jim</i>. It's slightly the worse for some of the borrowings, but the script is often hilarious, Newman and Redford making the best use of it when they get to parry dialogue with each other (eg, during the pursuit). It is much better and funnier than the <i>The Sting</i> precisely because it allows the two stars to play off each other.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Like a hugely ambitious DVD extra for a film that never was, this documentary charts the development of legendary French filmmaker Henri-Georges Clouzots 1964 riposte to the new wave, to be titled Inferno, and the films subsequent collapse in the face of spiralling budgets, recalcitrant performers and a director spinning off the rails.<br />Its a remarkable feat of cinematic archeology, taking in reminiscences from the key players plus Clouzots raw location footage and wildly sensuous test photography of star Romy Schneider. The directors impulse to widen the boundaries of cinema led to a series of experiments with all sorts of brand new psychedelic visual and audio techniques, leading to some remarkably warped and worrying imagery.<br />It remains unclear whether Inferno wouldve been the masterpiece Clouzot was anticipating: his reliance on tripped-out visuals and a staunchly unreconstructed attitude to sexual politics may have dated the film rapidly. What survives is a striking cautionary tale for budding filmmakers and a haunting evocation of experimentation run amok.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The second of Sirk's 'trilogy' of witty, light-hearted musicals nostalgically evoking small-town America around the turn of the century, blessed with an engaging and lively performance from Dan Dailey as the travelling medicine show proprietor who hides out a runaway orphan (Allen) and woos the pretty delegate from the orphanage board (Lynn) who is supposed to bring him back. The song-and-dance numbers are adequate rather than inspired (although the backstage routine involving Dailey and Carole Mathews is staged and shot with astonishing virtuosity); but Sirk's customary concern with hypocrisy and intolerance is, given the genre and overall tone of the piece, surprisingly to the fore in a subplot about corrupt politicians (admirably headed by the darkly handsome O'Brian).]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Despite indifferent Leslie Bricusse/Anthony Newley songs, an adaptation of Roald Dahl's charmingly eccentric novella (a Grimm-style moral tale) which has the true magic touch of fantasy. Slow to start, but once the youthful hero and four greedy companions arrive for their prize tour of the mysterious chocolate factory - hitherto operating behind locked gates, as hostile as Kane's Xanadu - the film really takes off. Whole landscapes of candy-striped trees, rivers of chocolate negotiable by gondola, sinister caverns manned by orange-faced dwarfs into which the greedier children disappear to suffer torments of their own devising. Great fun, with Wilder for once giving an impeccably controlled performance as the factory's bizarre owner.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Set in what is now Scotland in AD 117, The Descent director Neil Marshalls relentless, predictable chase movie draws upon the myth of the mysterious lost Ninth Legion of the Roman army. Stranded behind enemy lines following an ambush by Pictish warriors armed with giant fireballs, a ragtag, multi-ethnic band of Roman soldiers  reluctant leader Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender), stalwart Bothos (David Morrissey), joker Thax (JJ Feild), old-timer Brick (Liam Cunningham), agile African Macros (Noel Clarke) and cowardly cook Tarak (Riz Ahmed)  attempt to weave their way across country back to the last Roman fort. Lead by the fearsome Gorlacan (Ulrich Thomsen), and guided by skilled tracker Etain (Olga Kurylenko), the hostile locals remorselessly track their prey.<br /><br />Centurion is essentially one long, breathless pursuit sequence, punctuated by violent fight scenes and redundant quieter ones: for example, Quintuss drippy romance with ostracised Pictish witch Arianne (Imogen Poots) adds nothing but some lingering shots of Pootss ethereally beautiful face. And no amount of relentless forward momentum, head-smacking violence or CGI-enhanced blood-letting can disguise the anaemic characterisation and obvious contrivances. Stick-thin Bond girl Kurylenkos role as the mute, vengeful warrior Etain is no more believable or convincing than that of Keira Knightley in King Arthur. Both look as if a faint breeze would blow them over. The fearless, credible Fassbinder deserves better than this, as does The Wire alumnus Dominic West, cruelly wasted in an abbreviated cameo as the aptly named commanding officer General Titus Virilus. Finally, the abrupt, unsatisfying ending suggests a crisis of confidence in the cutting room.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The same themes and the same cool style as in <i>Laura</i> and <i>Angel Face</i> are at work in this portrait of the wealthy and sophisticated cracking apart at the seams, under pressure from psychological hang-ups, repressed passion, and innocent gullibility. When rich kleptomaniac Tierney turns for help not to her psychoanalyst husband (Conte) but to a hard-hearted hypnotherapist (Ferrer), she finds herself bereft of memory and implicated in a murder. Preminger translates the rather daft story (scripted by a pseudonymous Ben Hecht, loosely adapting Guy Endore's novel <i>Methinks the Lady</i>) into a typically unhysterical and lucid examination of people under stress: as the crime is investigated, currents of distrust, fear, and falsehood disturb the smooth waters of an apparently happy marriage. Content to observe rather than moralise, he creates a world of sympathetically flawed characters, the magnificent exception being the swindling quack, a manipulating charmer whose underplaying by Ferrer suggests credible evil. With its <i>noir</i> themes played out in cold, bright interiors, it's a fine example of the way Preminger, on occasion, managed to deflect routine melodrama into something more personal and profound.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Its easy to feel blas about the steady stream of action-oriented movies from the Far East, but this latest head-spinner from the director of the crunching Sympathy for Mr Vengeance is far, far too good to leave to the Asia Extreme crowd.<br /></p><p>When we first meet businessman Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-Sik), hes a drunken boor, though hed doubtless sober up if he knew what was coming. Abducted by persons unknown, hes held prisoner for 15 years, until hes just as unexpectedly released. Still none the wiser, he falls into a relationship with a sushi-bar hostess, whereupon his captor contacts him by mobile and offers a deal: if he can work out why he was kidnapped in the first place, the villain will offer up his life  if not, the girl cops it.<br /></p><p>For Oh Dae-Su, getting mad and getting even amount to virtually the same thing. The sequence where he rearranges some low-lifes dental work will doubtless attract over-excited attention, much like the jaw-dropping one-take hammer-wielding skirmish in a corridor. But the upfront mayhem shouldnt be allowed to distract from the films emotional depth or indeed its brilliant lead performance. For the protagonist, vengeance is a voyage of discovery, yet his newfound propensity towards violence troubles him, and his burning desire to confront his secretive nemesis may be fuelled by lingering self-doubt that he deserved his fate. Whatever happens, hell never be the same man again.<br /></p><p>Choi Min-Sik is in the Pacino or De Niro class, running the gamut from terrifying rage to abject degradation. The implausibilities in the plot melt away because were living the experience with him, thanks also in part to the bravura expressiveness of Parks direction. Hitchcock and Fincher are reference points, but this combines visceral punch, a tortured humanity and even an underlying Korean political resonance given the weight of the past. Quite an achievement then, and well worthy of its Cannes prize.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hollywoods early-70s identity crisis produced a multitude of masterpieces, but few are fit to stand alongside Bob Rafelsons autumnal 1970 tragedy Five Easy Pieces. In his most restrained and arguably finest role, Jack Nicholson plays Robert Eroica DuPea, a cultural refugee from a well-to-do musical dynasty hiding out in a California trailer park and trying unsuccessfully to drink and screw away his deep-seated sense of shame and self disgust.<br />Its a film of stark, superbly judged and beautifully sustained contrasts, the soundtrack hopping confidently from Tammy Wynette to Chopin as Bobby and his waitress girlfriend Rayette (Karen Black) travel from the lusty, sun-baked south to the cerebral, rainswept north to pay final respects to Bobbys dying father. Refusing to submit either to gross sentimentality or pompous pontificating, Rafelson and co-writer Adrien Joyce play their themes like piano keys, touching lightly but effectively on ideas of masculinity and mortality, class and creativity, family and frustration.<br />Its not a particularly subtle film  some of the supporting characters, notably Blacks dogged but witless Rayette, are written and played a little broadly  but it is a magnificently insightful and engaging one, flipping effortlessly from icy realism to heated melodrama while always maintaining a darkly comic, at times quietly satirical undercurrent. All of which is reflected in Nicholsons phenomenal central performance, for Bobby is himself a kind of actor, playing at being ugly, mean and self-sufficient in a doomed effort to disguise his absolute emotional emptiness, feeling himself exposed layer by layer as the film approaches its devastating climax.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The French-Argentinian filmmaker Gaspar No doesnt do subtlety. Hes experimental in some ways; in others, he has the refinement of Michael Bay. His last film, 2002s backwards-told tale Irrversible, is remembered for its scenes of skull-crushing and rape. Which is a shame because its also worth recalling its technical daring  especially its illusion of long, whirling takes  and ability to hold a vice-like grip on you while telling a story of revenge gone wrong during one nasty night in Paris.<br />Enter the Void is Nos third feature and his first since the storm of Irrversible. Its a more ambitious, unwieldy project: an equally kinetic attempt, with added special effects, to capture the spirit of a city, Tokyo, and a dead young American, Oscar (Nathaniel Brown), whose ghost floats about in a vaguely Buddhist manner after being shot dead by cops soon after smoking the drug DMT.<br />Death  and maybe the DMT  cause Oscar (and so us: this is first-person cinema) to revisit the events leading to his death.We see how he started selling drugs to pay for his sister Linda (Paz de la Huerta) to join him in Tokyo; how she became a stripper; how he was screwing a friends mum; how that friend grassed on him. The seedy is the everyday. We travel further too: to Oscars childhood and an accident that orphaned him and his sister.<br />When Enter the Void first showed at Cannes last year, it was more than three hours long. But No has reached for the scissors and cut about 45 minutes, reducing the length of scenes in which the screen breaks out into fractals, echoing the look of submarine life or human capillaries or, if youre unkind, those posters which you stare at until an eagle appears.<br />If you thought the camerawork in Irrversible induced nausea, wait until you get a dose of Enter the Void. We swing in and out of buildings, tear through walls. Not only that, but we leap into the cabin of a plane and take a vaginas eye view of a penis during sex. Theres nowhere Nos camera wont go, and as his version of Tokyo is a pit of sex and drugs, were never far from a flash of flesh or a dose of dope.<br />Much about Enter the Void is rotten. The acting stinks. No drops facts like lead balloons (Hey, have you read The Tibetan Book of the Dead?). Characterisation is weak. The use of Bachs Air on a G String is lazy and emotionally the film is as shallow as a declaration of love on E. <br />But you have to admire Nos ballsy vision and loopy execution, and the way he sucks you into this world with such a bold fusion of sound and image. Its not a massive leap from Avatar to Enter the Void: both care more for style over story, both reflect their makers odd world view. No, though, has no desire to please. Hed rather repel you. See where it takes you.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Filmed in 2006, German director Christian Alvarts first Hollywood feature  a dumb, glossy demon child movie with none of the subtlety of his debut, Antikrper  has languished on the shelf ever since. One can see why. A miscast Rene Zellweger plays social worker Emily Jenkins who, after saving ten-year-old Lilith (Jodelle Ferland) from being roasted alive in her mad parents oven, offers her a home. <br />At first, Emily thinks that Lilith is a classic damaged child, but then people start dying: one of Liliths classmates bludgeons his parents to death; Emilys boyfriend is killed by a swarm of hornets. Sceptical sheriff Mike Barron (a somnambulant Ian McShane) insists that a damaged, deceitful, manipulative child is not a demon, but by now Emilys do-gooder has pitched over into wild-eyed hysteria, raving about how Lilith is a malevolent catalyst who causes her victims to hallucinate their deepest, darkest fears. This is horror hokum of the cheesiest kind. Rent Orphan instead.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Ghostbusters</i> combines two of the most popular Hollywood products in recent years: <i>National Lampoon</i>/<i>Saturday Night Live</i>-style comedy and state-of-the-art special effects. But the story of a trio of incompetent 'experts' in the paranormal (Murray, Aykroyd and Ramis), who set up as ghostbusters after they are canned from their college sinecures, is less cynical a construction than it sounds. Reitman shows greater flair at controlling the anarchic comic rhythms of the <i>Lampoon</i>/<i>SNL</i> crowd than most of the directors who have attempted that hopeless task, and the effects are truly astonishing. <i>Close Encounters</i> meets <i>Animal House</i>, incidentally giving Murray's sleazily self-confident persona his best leading part to date.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This ultra-low-budget thriller did what all great B movies do: it broached a subject that 'respectable' movies wouldn't touch. In this case, the racist murder of a Jew (although it was a homosexual in Richard Brooks' source novel, <i>The Brick Foxhole</i>), and the exposure of the murderer's fanatical anti-Semitism. Dmytryk exploits the poverty-row sets for their claustrophobic quality, and introduces 'expressionist' lighting and distorted angles to dramatise the tensions that simmer and finally explode between the characters, GIs back from the war in Europe but not yet discharged. This was the kind of movie that provoked the McCarthy witch-hunt in Hollywood.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This family comedy sees an eccentric nanny magically appearing to heal the naughty, troubled kids of a handsome widower. Unlike Mary Poppins, however, Nanny McPhee is ugly; grotesque even. But while barely recognisable, writer-star Emma Thompson gradually sheds the exaggerated prosthetics (hairy warts, bulbous nose, etc.) each time the children learn a valuable lesson. Quite why, nobody explains: the film barely acknowledges its supernatural themes.<br />That McPhee appears to use magic to control the kids is secondary to the more involving story of the potential romance between their father Mr Brown (Colin Firth) and the maid (Kelly Macdonald), their union impeded by Great Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury), who insists Brown marry a suitable bride. While contrived, this storyline introduces the films most humorous character: showy money-grabbing widow Mrs Quickly (Celia Imrie). But that Nanny McPhee herself is so unengaging undermines the films impact, making it pleasing but ultimately unsatisfying.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Porter (Gibson) is the sort of guy who'll steal the notes from a blind beggar. Ripped off in a heist and left for dead by his wife and best friend, he's not about to take such treachery lying down. Director/co-writer Helgeland had a hand in <i>LA Confidential</i>, so there's a certain amount of pedigree here (the source novel is Richard Stark's <i>The Hunter</i>, previously filmed by John Boorman as <i>Point Blank</i>). Helgeland also co-scripted Mel Gibson's <i>Conspiracy</i> <i>Theory</i>, a paranoia thriller in the 1970s mode - but with a happy ending. Though there are no explicit date references, <i>Payback</i> is styled as a '70s movie manqu: dial phones and chunky automobiles; desaturated colour palette; funky soul/jazz score. The conceit even extends to the supporting roles, with such veterans as Kristofferson, Devane and Coburn representing 'the Outfit'. Sadly, it doesn't have the courage of its convictions. Where even a fair-to-middling '70s thriller like <i>Hustle</i> took its nihilism straight, this feels like a put-on.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Marvellously mixing semi-documentary aspects with traditional genre motifs, Walsh's archetypal gangster thriller follows the fates of three WWI doughboys who return to an America plagued with unemployment: while Lynn goes straight, Cagney's the good guy reluctantly drawn into bootlegging and killing by a ruthless Bogart, and forever pining for good girl Lane while ignoring the attentions of George's tart-with-a-heart. Most impressive for its frantic pace and its suggestion that in times of Depression almost everyone is corruptible, it's also a perverse elegy to a decade of upheaval: that sense of sadness and waste is perfectly encapsulated by George's final line, laconically pronounced over Cagney's corpse, 'He used to be a big shot'.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>This proudly low-tech animated feature harnesses an unlikely but wholly beguiling combination of the Ramayana, literary analysis, jazz-era music, autobiography and home moviemaking. Comic-strip artist Paley uses the Hindu story of Rama and Sitahes a king whose wife is kidnapped by a rival, but once he rescues her, he doubts her purityas a counterpoint to her own experiences separating from her husband after he takes a job in India.</p><p>The mix doesnt quite add up to a sense of narrative momentum, but the main thing to praise about <i>Sita</i> is its distinctive look. In an age of 3-D monsters and aliens, Paley demonstrates how much mileage you can get out of Flash-animated bobble motion and one-eyed bats. (The collagelike sequences of competing narrators debating the motives of the characters are particularly striking.) But why the blues? Well, why not? Paley finds effective moments in the story for the songs of jazz luminary Annette Hanshaw, making particularly catchy use of Daddy Wont You Please Come Home? This is the kind of personal filmmaking that could only have come together through a chance set of inspirations. Maybe you could call it fate.</p>]]></review>

After an argument with his mother, he runs off into the desert and accidentally crosses over into India. His father soon catches up with him but both are captured by soldiers and taken to jail. <br />Based on real events, the set-up of a young boy growing up as a prisoner of war recalls Life is Beautiful, although without that films sentimentality or chilling inevitability. In fact, the warm, airy cinematography makes the prison seem a little too attractive compared to the poverty and grief experienced by Ramchands mother, left behind wondering whether her family are alive or dead. But this doesnt detract from a moving story, realised with impressive maturity by first-time director Mehreen Jabbar. (Sarah Cohen)<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The first half of Kubrick's movie steers clear of South East Asia altogether, focusing on the dehumanising training programme undergone by a group of novice US Marines. Then, after a suitably melodramatic bloodbath, the action switches to 'Nam, where star recruit Pvt Joker (Modine) soon tires of his behind-the-lines job as military journalist and provokes his CO into sending him forth into the shit. Black but obvious irony abounds, madness and racist bigotry are rampant, and a muddled moral message arises from the mire of a sprawling second half when the cynical, nominally heroic Joker finally learns to kill. None of which is to suggest that the film is bad; despite a certain stereotyping and predictability there are moments of gripping interest. Finally, however, Kubrick's direction is as steely cold and manipulative as the rgime it depicts, and we never really get to know, let alone care about, the hapless recruits on view.]]></review>

During a fishing trip, the dog of Avery Ludlow (Cox) is shot by a psychotic teen (Fisher). Avery just wants an apology, but when the law wont help him, he takes up his own brand of vigilantism. Cox tries his best, but gets to shine only when delivering a monologue on his grisly family history. It begs to be elaborated upon, and is infinitely more worthy of screen time than this canine lovefest. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival<br /></i><br />The latest film from Woody Allen sees him back in London (well, Notting Hill, Bayswater, Maida Vale and other select locations) with the usual <i>dramatis personae</i> of arty types (novelists, gallery owners, painters, musicians, bookshop proprietors) and a predictably philistine hooker. Screened in Cannes immediately after Mike Leigh's film, it felt particularly unreal as a representation of London life  when did you last spend 50K on a pair of earrings?  but at least it's not as embarrassing as many of Allen's recent efforts.<br />Again there's a bit of voiceover stuck in to help us negotiate the narrative's structural shortcomings, but at least most of the cast  Naomi Watts, Josh Brolin, Gemma Jones, Anthony Hopkins, Antonio Banderas et al  do their best to inject some sort of emotional authenticity into the endless contrivances and coincidences. Centred on two problematic marriages, it's the usual roundelay of romantic longing, frustration and folly with the characters falling inconveniently in love, falling out with each other and falling flat on their faces through a mixture of desire and delusion. The title alludes to the overall theme that it may be wiser to place our faith in illusions rather than ina reality that inevitably proves disappointing, a theme that provides the film's funniest scenes in which Brolin's medic-turned-struggling writer argues with once-suicidal mother-in-law Jones, now conveniently convinced of reincarnation by clairvoyant Lucy Punch. <br />Still,despite a handful of good scenes (there are another couple between Watts and Banderas), much ofthe film feels tired, and some of it rather crass:that Hopkins becomes enamoured of a gold-diggingbimbo hooker makes for the most fruitlessly stereotype-laden of the narrative's various threads. But then maybe reality wasnt what Woody himself was looking for; after all, the world he portrays here is the stuff of illusion, so perhaps hes just hammering home his point.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Two beautiful strangers (Ranbir Kapoor/Priyanka Chopra) meet on a bridge; they both want to jump off it. They make a pact: a ‘wish-list’ of all the things they would like to do before they kill themselves at the end of the year. He wants to fall in love and lose his virginity; she wants to forget her cheating boyfriend (Zayed Khan). Will they commit suicide on New Year’s Eve or fall in love with each other? This genial yarn is unusual in that it focuses entirely on the two talented leads. They rise to the challenge and breathe credibility into a predictable journey. Different but not groundbreaking (an Indian woman loves only once!) this NRI (Non Resident Indian) bolly-romcom, set entirely in America, is undemanding and unpretentious.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The only vaguely remarkable thing about <i>Lucky Lady</i> is that it presents an overtly troilist relationship to its family audience with so little fuss: Hackman, Reynolds and Minnelli share a bed in '30s America, and make their living by running booze across the Mexican border. Unfortunately, the film's originality stops there, which is surprising since it was scripted by the talented Huyck/Katz partnership (<i>American Graffiti</i>, <i>The Second Coming</i>). Donen's determined 'lightness' is typified by the ghastly, insistent score which punctuates almost every action with a corny tune. The story is virtually non-existent, the period detail coyly derivative, and much of the comedy would be shamed even by the most meagre Anna Neagle vehicle of the '40s.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Even though Aldrich himself proclaimed a certain amount of dissatisfaction with the way this Western turned out, it's still one of his very finest films. A bleak and complex account of a platoon's hunt for a small group of Apaches who have escaped from their wretched reservation and committed acts of rape, murder, and mutilation, it never strays into the pitfall of portraying the Indians either as noble savages or as evil barbarians. Rather, Alan Sharp's marvellous script elucidates the issues and psychological causes of racial warfare, with Lancaster's weary army scout as the mouthpiece for unusually honest perceptions about both the Indians and the whites who have simply failed to comprehend them. It's brutally but never gratuitously violent, laden with images of death and destruction (beautifully caught by Joseph Biroc's camerawork), and far more than just an extraordinarily intelligent horse opera: the parallels with America's involvement in Vietnam should be easy to see.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Eight years after its Australian debut, <i>Stone</i> was wheeled onto the British circuits by distributors clearly chasing the audience that made the <i>Mad Max</i> cycle so successful. But any comparison with those films - or its true American ancestor <i>Wild Angels</i> - reveals that this is strictly a moped of a movie. To be fair, L plates are on display: it's a first feature for director Harbutt, who also produced, co-stars, and co-scripted. Stone himself (Shorter) is an undercover cop who infiltrates a gang of bikers known as The Undertakers (they bury their dead standing up 'so they won't have to take anything lying down'). His cover eloquently blown - 'This cat's a pig, man' - Stone ingratiates himself by riding a mean machine. Much footage of bikers abusing less than picturesque locals - cadging ciggies, stealing sauce-bottles, and so on - follows until suddenly it's all over. Like its hero's 'Levi originals', <i>Stone</i> badly needs the piss taken out of it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Sam Taylor-Woods first feature film is an astute rock n roll soap opera about the late teenage years of John Lennon. Its also a bit of a tease. In the opening scene we hear the first chord of Hard Days Night, the sound of screaming girls, a nod to Richard Lesters film of the same name and then nothing. In class, the distracted schoolboy John doodles walruses. On the way home, he passes Strawberry Fields. Much later, just as the film is about to end with John walking up a leafy street, about to leave Liverpool for Hamburg and history, his aunt mentions the change of his bands name from The Quarrymen to and, no, the name doesnt pass her lips. The film tiptoes around the future. The Beatles are the elephant in the scene.<br />In recent years, its become the rule that good films about musicians are formally loopy, while the less interesting ones play it straight. So its thumbs up for 24 Hour Party People and Im Not There and a pleasant shrug for Walk the Line and Ray. But Nowhere Boy shows no interest in redefining the form: Lennon was a pasty white bloke and so, unlike in Todd Hayness Bob Dylan film, its a pasty white bloke who plays him (the young, brooding Aaron Johnson, an actor who grows on you but is never quite right); the story is chronological; the narrator is reliable. Taylor-Woods background might be in video art but her approach to cinema is fundamentally different. She offers a conservative package with the odd radical flourish. Some of her choices, such as following Lennon and a pal as they ride on the top of a bus, are populist, even jarring, and suggest that she may not have fully found her own language on this first attempt.<br />Taylor-Wood and screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh mostly play it safe, offering an accessible period piece, free of nostalgia and full of key and credible emotional flashpoints. They focus sensitively on relationships, and especially those Lennon had with his aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott Thomas), with whom he lived, and his absent mother, Julia (Anne-Marie Duff), who came back into his life for the short period in the late 1950s covered by the film. The music and the meeting of the boys who became The Beatles take a back seat to this domestic drama. Even the early bonding of John with a more fresh-faced Paul (Thomas Sangster) is explained by the loss, in one way or another, of their respective mothers. When the only Lennon song in the film  Mother  plays over the closing credits, its a confirmation of the films chief theme: mums and the shadow they cast.<br />The two key performances come from Scott Thomas and Duff as the two women in Lennons life. Scott-Thomas plays Mimi as a prude whose attitude is born of protectiveness rather than instinct. Duff, meanwhile, pulls off the trick of being more likeable but less trustworthy. The most interesting element of the film is Taylor-Woods suggestion of a latent sexual chemistry between John and his mother, an idea that rather than feeling wild or gratuitous comes across as a sensible observation about a vulnerable but adventurous adolescent. <br />]]></review>

In effect, this is the biopic of a poem: the events leading to its creation, the intensive writing process and the cultural fallout when it was published – scathing reviews, an obscenity trial, instant notoriety. The poem is illustrated in vibrant, hallucinatory, occasionally overcooked animated sequences, the courtroom sequences provide much-needed levity and Franco's committed, selfless central performance is a revelation.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The French were so dismayed by Stanley Kubricks sober portrait of sinister, high-level manoeuvres behind the lines of the World War I trenches that they banned his third feature from their screens for many years. Certainly the direct accusation here  lifted from Humphrey Cobbs source novel  is that the pompous, twisted and fictional French commander General Paul Mireau (George Macready) possesses not an ounce of sympathy for his embattled troops (There is no such thing as shell-shock!). He wilfully orders a suicidal mission that he knows will fail and, when it does, perversely decides that three soldiers  picked arbitrarily  must face a military court and, if found guilty, execution. <br />Whats so startling  and impressive  about Kubricks storytelling is the cold, matter-of-fact manner with which the film unfolds. Mireau is suitably grotesque but never a c aricature; the three accused men react naturally (one is a simpering coward) and elicit only natural  not heroic  sympathy; and Kubrick employs his camera with rational, military precision, especially during a superbly shot court sequence in which he applies equal coverage to each man on trial. The result is that our dismay and anger become directed at war itself, not individuals. Ultimately, despite the limp rendition of the Marseillaise at the films opening, its not the French but all military that come off badly here.<br />The films  and Kubricks  conscience is Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax, an idealist and troublemaker caught between his men and his superiors. Douglas performance is enthralling, but perhaps the films only bum note is Daxs  later emergence as a hero in the face of everyone else, both guilty and innocent. Still, the final scene, in which Kubrick presents close-ups of soldiers watching a captured German girl being forced to sing for their pleasure is nothing short of masterful.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>In his superb documentary <i>Los Angeles Plays Itself</i>, Thom Andersen holds up <i>The Exiles</i> as one of a handful of films that strip away all artifice and simply depict the real Los Angelesnot as a city of glamour or crime, but as an urban space, filled with poverty and desperation. (Its matched in Andersens estimation by Charles Burnetts <i>Killer of Sheep</i>, which similarly received a belated release from Milestone Films last year.)</p><p>But in another sense, its difficult to see <i>The Exiles</i> apart from its movieness: It plays like a West Coast companion piece to Lionel Rogosins <i>On the Bowery</i> and John Cassavetess <i>Shadows</i> (is there a Chicago analogue?), straddling the line between documentary and fiction, imbued with a Beat-noir feel and a jukebox soundtrack. It opens with a series of photographs of stoically posed American Indians and then spins a loose narrative in counterpoint, setting its characters (all played by nonprofessional Native American actors) loose on L.A.s long-demolished Bunker Hill neighborhood over the course of a night. The voiceover is deliberately crude, often mumbled. Yvonne, the most distinct of the movies multiple narrators, spends part of the evening exiled in a movie theater; indeed, MacKenzies images often evoke the loneliness of Hopper paintings.</p><p>Obviously a landmark, <i>The Exiles</i> lacks the lyrical impact of Killer of Sheep. Its best appreciated as a kind of majestic documenta tour of marquees and gas stations and the culture that changed along with them.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The only survivor when a car plunges into a river, Mary Henry (Hilligoss) emerges on to a sandbank like a sodden sleepwalker. Shortly afterwards, en route to Utah to take up a job as a church organist, Mary is frightened by a ghostly apparition, a white-faced man whose repeated appearances seem mysteriously connected with an abandoned carnival pavilion. Other strange episodes, during which Mary seems to become invisible and inaudible to those around her, exacerbate her feeling that she has no place in this world. With its striking black-and-white compositions, disorienting dream sequences and eerie atmosphere, this has the feel of a silent German expressionist movie. Unfortunately, so does some of the acting, which suffers from exaggerated facial expressions and bizarre gesturing. But the mesmerising power of the carnival and dance-hall sequences far outweighs the corniness of the awkward intimate scenes; and as Mary, caught in limbo between this world and the next, dances to the discordant carnival music of time, the subsequent work of George Romero and David Lynch comes constantly to mind.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Howard Hawkss late-period comic essay on the economic advantages of an ample bosom is not one of his best, though it just about works as a naughty Technicolor bellwether to these Sex and the City-fixated times. Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell play a pair of chesty chisellers aboard a cruise ship bound for Paris, forced to work their faux-ditsy charms amid a chorus of male admirers. While theres enough laboured screwball and gauche innuendo to raise the odd titter, its the kitsch background details that generate much of the fun: just try not to smirk at the flesh-toned underwear of the backing singers for Russells rendition of Aint There Anyone Here for Love?. Still, if camp comedy capering (dont call it a social satire!) isnt your thing, its worth the ticket to see Monroes iconic and flawlessly choreographed performance of Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend: a perfect four minutes of film.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Co-scripted by Philip Yordan - who wrote <i>Johnny Guitar</i> as well as Mann's two great epics, <i>El Cid</i> and <i>The Fall of the Roman Empire</i> - this is a French Revolutionary drama made on the lines of Mann's <i>films noirs</i> like <i>T-Men</i>, with atmospheric camerawork by John Alton and ambitious art direction (the producer was William Cameron Menzies, who made <i>Things To Come</i> and designed <i>Gone With the Wind</i>). History is thrown to the wolves as Robert Cummings impersonates a public prosecutor and tries to overthrow the dictatorship of Robespierre (Basehart), whose incriminating 'Black Book' (furnishing the British release title) has been stolen. Historians will scoff and the casting is hardly French, but on its own terms the movie works very well.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The last gasp of the neo-realist spirit in Visconti's work, <i>Rocco</i> chronicles at length the misfortunes that befall an Italian peasant family when they move to The Big City. There's a grey conviction about much of the scene-setting and the location shooting, but the film gathers interest as it escalates into melodrama; the tragic climax is pure opera. Delon is unconvincing as the saintly Rocco, but Renato Salvatori makes the thuggish elder brother who falls in with a gay boxing promoter his best part ever.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Walsh's epic Western has gone down in cinema history as the film that made bit-part actor Marion Morrison into leading man John Wayne (though it needed Ford's <i>Stagecoach </i>to revive his career a decade later). Originally made simultaneously in normal 35mm and a short-lived 70mm process called 'Grandeur', it has recently been restored to its spectacular wide-screen glory. The saga of a wagon trail, the film is more striking now for its wide shots - vast landscapes, wagons being hauled up impossibly steep cliffs - than for the knockabout humour of the character scenes.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The quintessential '50s rock film, containing legendary appearances from Fats Domino, the Platters, Little Richard and Gene Vincent among its seventeen numbers, though the greatest musical moment is perhaps Eddie Cochran belting out '20 Flight Rock'. The story is a fairly biting satire on the PR worlds of rock and advertising, with Ewell as a press agent and Mansfield as a dumb blonde who rockets to stardom after imitating a prison siren on a rock record. This is the film in which Tashlin made Mansfield hold two milk bottles next to her boobs for a momentary visual gag; and he was capable of even crueller humour, as the sequel <i>Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?</i> proved.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A momentous gangster movie which took the genre out of its urban surroundings into the bleak sierras, and in so doing marked its transition into <i>film noir</i>. It isn't just that Bogart's Mad Dog Earle is a man 'rushing towards death', infallibly doomed and knowing it, from the moment he is paroled and through the half-hearted hold-up to his last stand on the mountainside. He also in a sense wills his own destruction, his dark despair fuelled by the betrayal of an innocent, clubfooted country girl whose operation he pays for, and who casually abandons him as soon as she can 'have fun'. Terrific performances, terrific camerawork (Tony Gaudio), terrific dialogue (John Huston and WR Burnett from the latter's novel), with Walsh - who in fact reworked the material as <i>Colorado Territory</i> eight years later - giving it something of the memorable melancholy of a Peckinpah Western.]]></review>

With a strong supporting cast, it's surprisingly entertaining. The plot, derived from a story by Leslie Charteris previously filmed in Britain as <i>A Window in London</i>, doesn't delve into the dark chaos beloved of <i>noir</i> thrillers in the '40s so much as play it slightly tongue-in-cheek. Light, cheery and shading into darker areas for the climax, it's fun.]]></review>
