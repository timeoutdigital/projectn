      <review><![CDATA[<p>To make the titular substance of Nadine Labakis Beirut-set first feature, sugar must be heated just so or the result will be a tarry disaster. Although certainly sweet, <i>Caramel</i>s liability is that it rests at too tepid a temperature.</p><p>For those whove seen <i>Venus Beauty Institute</i>or <i>Beauty Shop</i>the template will be a familiar one: the sororal setting and consciousness-raising-lite vibe of the salon. Various concerns bedevil the protagonists: Depilator Layale (Labaki) has a married lover; stylist Nisrine (Al Masri) hasnt told her fianc shes not a virgin; shampooer Rima (Moukarzel) likes ladies; customer Jamale (Aouad) fears aging. </p><p>The cast, primarily first-time performers, is charming, and every country (and culture) should have its own ya-ya sisterhood movies. But Labaki, who cowrote the script with two men, is too cautious. Rather than being Lebanons answer to <i>The L Words </i>Shane, Rima is allowed only a few furtive ogles on a bus and the ministering of a lather and rinse to a longhaired beauty. Then again, the soft butch sees more onscreen action than her pals. As Layale prepares to remove a customers errant hairs with caramel, she yells, Heat the sugar, please. One wishes Labaki had done the same for her filmperhaps by heating the sugar walls. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Faulting Tyler Perry for his nonsensical, melodramatic plots is a little like accusing Douglas Sirk of using too much color. In this soaper about four couples in various states of marital discord, Perry leaves the Madea padding behind; the fat enhancement is worn by Jill Scott, who finds the love of a good man in the Rockies. To the writer-directors great credit, he actually seems to <i>like</i> his characters, especially the womenwhich cant be said of most men who don fat-female drag. But note: Five cast members in Perrys film have appeared on the CWs <i>Girlfriends</i>, which, now in its eighth season, tackles the same themes with far more finesse and intelligence]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Its quite likely that Staff Sergeant William James (Renner)the bomb-defusing expert at the center of the terrific Iraq War action film <i>The Hurt Locker</i>was named by screenwriter Mark Boal after a certain pragmatic 19th-century philosopher. On the cleverness-to-profundity scale, that falls somewhere between calling a desert-island survivalist Locke and christening a living stuffed tiger Hobbes. But James is more than his moniker, not so much larger-than-life as eternally engaged, gruntlike, with the one thing he does better than anyone else. </p><p>Renner, whose half-muscled pudginess calls to mind Fassbinder circa <i>Fox and His Friends,</i> gets inside Jamess skin in ways that a more seasoned celebrity could not. Its a role that might have easily devolved into one-note paeans to badassery, especially in concert with an episodic story structure that constantly toggles between machismo-laden home-base drama and perilously prolonged fieldwork. Yet in this actors hands, the character comes off with a credible working-class clarityhes less concerned with performing kiss-off heroics than with doing a good job and pissing the night away. </p><p>The James-free prologue, which features the first of two kill-em-off star cameos, seemingly sets the stakes high. But director Kathryn Bigelow, doing her run-n-gun best, doesnt mine traditional suspense so much as impart a queasy feeling of monotony. <i>The Hurt Locker </i>is all about existing in an often repetitious moment. Superimposed titles count down the days left in James and his squads rotation, though theres little sense of movement toward an ultimate endpoint. As the opening Chris Hedges quote (War is a drug) suggests, there are no accomplishments in this line of work, only an unending round of highs, lows and in-betweens. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Germanys mountain film, or <i>bergfilme,</i> gets a semisuccessful modern update with <i>North Face,</i> which focuses on a failed, purportedly factual 1936 ascent of Switzerlands treacherous Eiger peak by alpinists Toni Kurz (Frmann) and Andi Hinterstoisser (Lukas). The movie features an abundance of melodramatic, emotion-stoking cues, most of them courtesy of Tonis old flame Luise (Wokalek), whos not about to let the mountain take her man. But its also colored, detrimentally so, by 20/20 historical hindsight. </p><p>Cleverly playing on the genres propagandistic ties to the Third Reich, the film reflects the tragic arc of National Socialism in each ominous crevasse and in every grandiloquent gesture. Yet all the retroactively enlightened symbolism gets monotonous, and reaches an absurd apex with the introduction of a party-line newspaperman played by that scowling emblem of Teutonic depravity, Ulrich Tukur (see also <i>The White Ribbon</i>). </p><p>Yet the visual splendora seamless mix of practical locations and refrigerated studio setscannot be denied. <i>Avatar</i>s swoop-n-slide digital fakery has nothing on the vertigo-inducing set pieces cooked up by director Philipp Stlzl and cinematographer Kolja Brandt. These range from the tried-and-true (those faulty carabiners are Pavlovian suspense generators) to the poetically inspired (a go-for-broke rescue mission is filmed to evoke Tonis literal tethering to the heavens). And never doubt the ability of creakily frostbitten fingers to elicit an empathetic spine shiveror a Damn, son! face crinkle. Indeed, its easy to ignore <i>North Face</i>s ill-conceived sociopolitical allegory whenever the mountain, a truly merciless antagonist, takes center stage.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Movies as sexy and colorful as <i>Broken Embraces</i> really shouldnt feel this boring. But thats the troubling thing thats happened with the work of Pedro Almodvar, whose catty, chatty melodramas now play like dutiful festival mainstays rather than truly vibrant alternatives. The Spanish director is too assured not to serve up a spicy mealand his longtime leading lady, Penlope Cruz, is riding a fascinating crest of post<i>Vicky Cristina Barcelona</i> complexity. But watching the new film is like getting upsettingly full on insubstantial tapas: You would never say no to just one more, but theres better.</p><p>After a standout opening seduction in which a blind man manages to charm an assistant half his age out of her jeans, the movie settles into a strangely stilted four-way. Theres the aforementioned lothario with the pen name Harry Caine (Homar), once a popular film director but now a screenwriter in the dark; his former producer, a shady businessman whom we see only in flashback; the young secretary they both shared as a lover (Cruz); and a mysterious, intense videographer (Ochandiano) out for unspecified vengeance.</p><p>Shifts in tone between comic frustrations and romantic jealousy are elegantand too polite from the maker of the sparky <i>Talk to Her</i>. Were supposed to care about the fate of a botched farce, stolen from the directors hands and disastrously recut, but such editing-table discussions are stalled in an echo chamber of Hitchcock allusions (mainly for snobs only). Eventually, the movie meanders to a lost-father story and one revelation too many. Almodvar needs to push himself again.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>You boys seem a little on edge, offers Leonardo DiCaprio to the cops guarding an island of the damneda mental institution. Now, the amateur sleuth in you might take this as a clue. Hmm. That, or the Transylvanian fog, ridiculous even for Boston. Or the tug captain who actually says, Storms coming! Comfort surely doesnt arrive in the form of spooky Ben Kingsley, as the residing headshrinker; Max von Sydow, never a jocund presence, isnt far behind. Its all what the experts call dramatic foreshadowingif by that, they mean a centurys worth of chimney soot.</p><p>Martin Scorseses <i>Shutter Island </i>isnt subtle. Its a 50s-set thriller that wears its craft like a cloak with the collar up. Fans of the directors wicked rethink of<i> Cape Fea</i>r (1991) will insist hes done this before and expertly. But whereas that movie played to Scorseses class-conscious strengths, this one plunges us deep into loony-bin territory. (Its Scor-crazy.) A violent patient is on the loose and our marshal heroes, Teddy (DiCaprio) and Chuck (Ruffalo), offer pursuit, stubbornly racing around the island as the wind whips. But already, the histrionic style gives away too much.</p><p>If the material, adapted by Laeta Kalogridis from Dennis Lehanes slippery novel, disappoints, you can still count on Scorsese for punch. So many of his famous sequences are charged with a dream logicindeed, the whole of After Hoursthat when he finally allows himself to make proper nightmares, they blow you away. Teddys dead wife haunts him in vivid color and scenes of falling ash. (She perished in a fire.) There are swirling papers and flashbacks to Dachau, of all places. Still, coming from <i>Scorsese,</i> Shutter Island is slumming: minor but enjoyably nuts.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Still, someone was definitely using their brain when they omitted that piece of information. Even without the added portent,<i> The White Ribbon</i> comes dangerouslywonderfully?close to playing like an evil-kid flick. Were never told the year, but the setting is agrarian: a farming hamlet in northern Germany before the start of the First World War. Class divisions are stark. The landowning baron (Tukur) rigidly presides over his many employees, who comprise much of the town. Farmers seethe when one of their number accidentally dies. A ferocious pastor (Klaussner) offers little in the way of compassion or wisdom.</p><p>Watching all of this are the bright, thoughtful eyes of young people; <i>The White Ribbon</i> never lacks for incident, but it truly takes off when it hews to impressionable minds quietly considering the fate of a fallen horse, a wounded bird, a blinded mentally ill peer. Who is responsible for these crimes of vengeance? Shot in a crisp monochrome by Christian Berger, the movie not so subtly approaches its theme of moral inflexibility. The writer-director is Michael Haneke, whose severe perfection has, in the past, been put to thornier purposes (2005s majestic <i>Cach</i>), but never ones this important. Finally, the Austrian master is digging up the very roots of fascism; these are the abused children who, decades later, would stare at horror with the same curious eyes, both as witnesses and perpetrators.</p>]]></review>

While the others trade in stop-motion precision and CGI physics, this one goes fully for abstraction. Its a brooding story set firmly in the Dark Ages and Celtic legend. When smoke billows over the walled, titular enclavea home to gentle monks and familiesthe plumes come in looping, circular scribbles and your mind has to make the leap. (It does.)</p><p>In Kells lives young Brendan (McGuire), who, shepherded by his severe abbot father (the tart-tongued Gleeson), intends one day to illuminate a book with his goose-quilled pen. The boy yearns to see the outside world, though, and this is where he goesthe mostly hand-drawn animation morphs into strange new shapes as the trees narrow, crows caw menacingly and a female fairy slinks around in the form of a snowy panther. Its all fairly enchanting, and theres the added euphoria of being free of the incessant pop-culture riffing of either Disney or Altman-loving hipster directors. The movie isnt quite suitable for the extremely young, but its apocalyptic tint may be catnip for smart preteens. Theyll breathe in the chilly air of a mysterious forestthe way forests should be. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Dont let the surface sensationalism of Andr Tchins latest chilled melodrama fool you: Per its opening disclaimer, the movie is only inspired by the true story of a 23-year-old Frenchwoman who was the victim of an anti-Semitic attackonly to later admit shed lied about the whole thing. In fact, despite <i>The Girl on the Train</i>s dissection into two distinct chaptersCircumstances and Consequencestheres little to suggest Jeanne (Dequenne) is any different from your typically restless youth. She Rollerblades around Paris, lives at home with Mom (Denueve) and enjoys the attention of an aggressively flirty amateur wrestler (Duvauchelle). Then tragedy strikes her boyfriend, and out of nowhere, the goyish Jeanne draws a swastika on her belly, cuts herself and claims shes been assaulted by Arab immigrants. <br /></p><p>Tchin offers a character study in lieu of context for the similar 2007 hoax that threw the French press into a tizzy, and like many of his best films, this what-if examination works best as an actors showcase. For those of us whove been fans of Dequenne since her role as a blanc-trash Belgian waif in Rosetta (1999), her subtle portrayal of the pathological perpetrator proves that shes monumentally talented. But if the directors trademark elliptical approach doesnt turn the tabloid fodder into a film-eclipsing circus, it fails to shed much light on the incident either, reducing the lethargic Consequences section to the equivalent of a shrug, and Jeannes rationale for fibbing to wanting to feel loved. Thankfully, we arent given hand-wringing or easy blame-game answers. Nor, however, are we given anything resembling sociological resonance, or much reason to care.</p>]]></review>

But last years two triumphant jail dramas, <i>Bronson</i> and <i>Hunger,</i> have just arrived on DVD, and now comes what must be the ultimate cell-block saga. <i>A Prophet </i>is nearly three hours of shanking, squealing and surviving: a riveting narrative about the nature and accrual of power. Its easily the best film to come out of last years tepid Cannesor maybe several Cannes. Advisably or not, director Jacques Audiard had delivered a kind of a how-to <i>Scarface </i>without the tiger in the backyard; even though this Gallic crime-specialist (<i>The Beat That My Heart Skipped</i>) has distanced himself from such comparisons, theyre there for the taking. And yet, <i>A Prophet</i> is redeemed by its intellect.</p><p>Arriving at a noisy French prison is 19-year-old Malik (the deeply sympathetic Rahim), who resembles less a hard-timer than a yummy cupcake. He quickly toughens up under the brutal tutelage of Corsican kingpin Csar (Arestrup) and the movies grueling tale multiplies in complexity. Razors are stashed in mouths, the yard divides racially, and Malik learns to score drugs and favors. The undercurrent of <i>A Prophet</i> is Audiards bracing naturalism: The camerawork is often handheld and jittery but suffused with an ominous sense of poetic fate. (A deer crossing is milked extensively.) There are dealings on the outsidesuppliers, a cancer-addled compadre, some scary shoot-outsbut the movie zings along with perfectly-paced verve, punctuated by Tarantino-esque title cards. Why do we care? Because never before have the steps to thugdom, as depressing as that destination may be, been so rigorously detailed, neither romanticized nor negated. Dont miss.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Among the things you can learn at the movies this week: Benito Mussolini was red-hot in <i>il sacco.</i> As a sexy union organizer, the budding fascist (Timi) looms large in bed over the pale body of our heroine, Ida (Mezzogiorno), one hand throttling her neck, his eyes bulging with dominance. She digs it. Its not long, plotwise, before Ida is splayed nude across the bed, having sold all her possessions to fund a newsletter. Even as her man is swept away on a tide of populism, Ida carries the flameshe sees the plebs rising up to salute his image at the cinema and knows she was there first.</p><p><i>Vincere,</i> an extraordinarily operatic affair, then becomes the ultimate he-never-called-me-back film. (It should have been marketed as an artier <i>Hes Just Not That Into You</i>.) The real-life marriage claim of Ida Dalser remains contested, but its clear that Mussolini returned from the WWI front a changed man, prone to eliminating records and erasing the inconvenient. The movie plays up these reversals of fortune with epic, Italianate sweep, born aloft by Carlo Crivellis juicy wall-to-wall score, a spikier take on Ennio Morricones lushness. Ida cries at the bars of her mental institution while passersby call her Mussolina; Benito Jr., the grown-up love child (also Timi), also goes crazy and starts spouting a spot-on impression of Papa. </p><p>Almost as an afterthought to the ringingly true performancesand Marco Bellocchios unusually approachable directioncomes a deft analysis of fascism, likened to lovesickness, insanity and a gust of orchestral strings. Its all of that and more, not to mention a lousy matchmaker.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Given the months-long hype, whats most bewildering about Sundance sensation Precious is its overall shrug-worthiness. Youd think the litany of horrors that befall Harlem teenager Clareece Precious Jones (Sidibe)illiteracy, rape, domestic abuse, Mariah Careywould register with some piercing and perceptive effect. Instead, they pass by with the glazed-over, lookie-lookie luridness of a <i>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</i> episode. </p><p>And yet, at the films center is a fully lived-in performance by newcomer Gabourey Gabby Sidibe, who will hopefully go on to better things and not be cast aside, <i>Slumdog</i>-style, in the post-awards season. The actor holds her own with such scene-stealers as MoNiquedangling her cigarettes with Oscar-baiting malevolence as Preciouss mom, Maryand navigates the neorealism-lite trappings with brazen, always arresting confidence.</p><p>The films best scenes take place in a literacy class headed by a tough-love educator (Patton). Its here that Precious finds the means to express herself in ways reminiscent of Celie, the uneducated heroine of Alice Walkers novel <i>The Color Purple</i>. Indeed, director Lee Daniels seems to be aping Steven Spielbergs adaptation of <i>Purple</i> (specifically the sequence where Celie discovers a long-hidden pile of letters from her sister) in the moment when the camera circles Precious while video images of Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, et al. are projected around her. The meaning is the samehistory floods the consciousness of both Celie and Precious and powerfully widens their worldviewbut Danielss methods are decidedly cruder. Its hardly surprising that, in another instance, he emphasizes the revulsion of incest by cutting to a pan of sizzling eggs. Even the worst behaviors, he appears to be saying, have to go over easy.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Zoe Kazan doesnt exactly explode hereits more the churning upset of lovesick implosion. (You dont have to be a doctor to realize that her character, Ivy, also coping with epilepsy, has a serious case of boyfriend-attention disorder.) She lolls around Manhattan and Brooklyn during a brief break from college, quietly yielding to the vibrations of her cell and flirting in that infuriatingly blank way perfected by hipsters.</p><p>Yet it would be a mistake to confuse Bradley Rust Grays slender drama for another bit of disposable mumblecore. <i>The Exploding Girl</i> plunges us deep into the wide eyes of its up-and-coming star, who almost certainly wont find a better vehicle for her quiet, cherubic charms. The incidents of the movie are minimal: walks, naps, rooftop hangs. Still, you calibrate to Kazans loping paceas well as that of a potential suitor, Al (Rendall), not quite the lure that we hope for. The movie is inward and vaguely gothy; not for nothing does its title reference a Cure B-side. (If you know the song, consider that a personal invite.) You begin to pick up a feeling for the warm weather and well-judged locations.</p><p>Gray and his filmmaker-producer wife, So Yong Kim (<i>In Between Days</i>), are something of a rising force in indie cinema. There have been arguments about whether their underdramatized moviesincluding last years <i>Treeless Mountain</i>are beneficial or represent settling for less. Heres a corollary opinion: When you have an actor as suggestive as Kazan, swallowing up the lens with allure and complexity, your writer-director becomes superfluous. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Wes Andersons stop-motion-animated Roald Dahl adaptation is one for the auteurist in us all: Newspaper-columnist-cum-chicken-stealer Mr. Fox (Clooney) dresses like his director, drives his family bonkers like Royal Tenenbaum and even has a Steve Zissouesque epiphany courtesy of a Black Power! fist-raising wolf. The overall sensation is of an artist repeating himself, scaling down his obsessions to empty-vessel miniatureat last, Anderson has made a film that is <i>nothing</i> but a succession of autumn-gold shoebox dioramas. </p><p>Its unfortunate that the result is so unaffecting, especially in light of all the things the director does right. Theres plenty here to thrill animation buffs, and Andersons most inspired choice was to record the majority of the actors in scene-appropriate locations (barns, fields, basements), which minimizes the studio-miked disconnect between voices and characters that hampers a good many animated films. Coupled with the often caressingly extreme close-ups of these singular puppet creationsits wonderful how the animals fur quivers slightly in each frametheres never any doubt that were in the presence of a precisely conceived world. And thats the problem. Theres usually a hand-of-God meticulousness to Andersons work, but something inexplicably soulful almost always manages to intrude. Its this aspect that elevates the best of his films, like the section in his underrated India picture, <i>The Darjeeling Limited,</i> in which the brothers stumble upon a drowning village boy and are forced to deal with something horribly outside their comfort zone. Theres no such quality in <i>Fantastic Mr. Fox,</i> which is all hermetically hollow gestures and poses. Thats what I do, says Mr. F. when asked about his trademark whistle-and-tooth-clicking salute. All Anderson does is slavishly further the brand. <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Actor Carey Mulligan is filmed like a goddess in <i>An Education.</i> In looks and demeanor, she seems caught between prim elegance and outlaw modishness, appropriately suggestingin light of the storys period settinga 60s-era Audrey Hepburn. This starlets performance is the best reason to see an otherwise jumbled adaptation of Lynn Barbers memoir, in which Mulligans disaffected British teen, Jenny, has a transformative adolescent experience. </p><p>Jennys life is a predictable succession of prep-school testing, youth orchestra and parental protestations, until the fateful day when a handsome stranger offers her a lift during a downpour. Hes David (Sarsgaard), a man nearly twice her age, who pours on the charm with all the irresistible come-hitherness of a Tex Avery wolf. </p><p>But hes still a wolf: Fancy dinners and impromptu trips to Paris are the norm, yet theres something off about David, a creepiness underlying his seeming perfection. Sarsgaard is expert at implied malevolence, though hes less convincing as a refined man of the world (hes one of the few performers now working who can be both perfectly cast and miscast). </p><p>The bigger problem is the way in which this cautionary coming-of-age tale is told. Lone Scherfig directs it all as if it were a breezy lark, so a third-act tonal shift makes for an incongruous, excessively moralistic fit with everything thats preceded. Most insulting, though, is the way in which the climactic passages miraculously tidy up every frayed edge of Jennys life. Who knew that an Oxford education had the healing power of Lourdes?</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In bringing Perraults three-page folk tale of a murderous old hermit and his steely young bride to the screen as a stripped-back gothic miniature, Breillat has produced what could be one of her most instantly pleasurable films to date. Cheerily narrated by two young sisters as they read the story to one another in a dusty attic, the drama of how newly destitute Marie-Catherine (Creton) accepts the repugnant Bluebeards (Thomas) hand in marriage plays out in a series of sparse, elegantly constructed tableaux which ride on a pair of wonderfully sad-eyed performances from the leads. Some fans of the director may be disheartened to hear that there is no sex or nudity to speak of, though the film still offers a clear-sighted admonishment of patriarchal entitlement along with a stark contemporary relevance.<br />]]></review>

The opening credits have barely rolled and shes already gotten her close-up; sad to say, the film that follows feels comparatively like an afterthought. </p><p>Kim plays the unnamed mother of the title, who runs an apothecary and dotes on her mentally challenged son, Do-joon (Bin). They have a queasy relationship, something Bong emphasizes during an early scene in which Mom is so obsessed with keeping her boy in view that she nearly slices her finger off. Blood runs deep in this family and, if youre familiar with the directors work (<i>Memories of Murder; The Host</i>), you know theres a great likelihood that its somehow going to be spilled. </p><p><i>Mothe</i>r does indeed bear this out, though not before spending a laborious amount of time on a murder plotinvolving Do-joon and a promiscuous schoolgirlwith narrative twists that thud like a two-by-four to the skull. Bong is so concerned with whodunit that his creaky genre mechanics diminish Kims determined performance: Shes often shunted to the side of the action, especially when Do-joons friend (Jin) comes forth to do some teeth-cracking kick-assery that panders to the fanboys.</p><p>And though the film beautifully visualizes Mas last-act plunge into blissful ignorance, Bong fails to give her fate any substantive sense of tragedy. By the time he rounds his way back to the opening scene, the character has lost all emotional pull, and her hysteria rings hollow.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Christopher Isherwoods seminal queer novel deserves a film adaptation that captures both its sense of place and its activist spirit. Cowriter-director Tom Ford settles for the glossy ephemera of a <i>Vanity Fair </i>cover spread. Both Isherwood and Ford follow Brit-expat college professor George (Firth, dully competent despite the film festival plaudits and Oscar buzz) through a single, sun-baked California day at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis. But only in the film is there a hoary motivating factora suicidal death wish stemming from Georges mournful pining for his dead lover Jim (Goode)meant to round off edges that should remain jagged. (The most frayed thing onscreen is, tellingly, an angora sweater.)</p><p>Fords biggest mistake is making George a martyrdom-ready symbol; too many movies subscribe to the regressive notion that queers are unassailable victims of fate and circumstance. One of the most revealing amendments here involves a flashback in which George is informed of Jims death and is refused an invite to the funeral. Theres no such melodramatic manipulation in Isherwoods tome, where George is invited to the funeral and refuses out of a fascinatingly contradictory mix of pride, prejudice and anguish. It deepens his humanity rather than making him allegorically alien. </p><p>Isherwood set out to normalize his gay protagonists experience, showing the many different poses he assumed within a seemingly routine day (in that context, masturbation was as mundane yet significant an occurrence as driving on the freeway). Ford privileges sexual preference over all else. Its the defining trait of his Georgea <i>Camille</i>-esque affliction signaled by a portentous cough and overcome in a sacrificial ending that turns Isherwoods beautifully enigmatic final passages into a poisonous, irony-laced tear-jerk.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Tellingly, one of the codirectors of this deeply humane Arab-Israeli dramaPalestinian filmmaker Scandar Coptialso plays its most empathetic character: Binj, a likeable, long-bearded stoner. True to his name (or at least its sound), he seems to be suffused with the modern possibilities in Israel: dance clubs, cute Jewish girlfriends, recreational drugs. Binj works happily in a kitchen in Jaffa, a subdivision of Tel Aviv and a tense melting pot. Alas, even someone as laid-back as Binj is drawn into the regions endless cycle of violence, which the expertly woven Ajami presents as inexorable.</p><p><i>Ajami</i> is Israels submission to the Oscars, and like the gritty <i>City of God</i> before it, it takes harrowing, tricky circumstances and illuminates them with Scorsesian snap. You might get a little lost in the folds, but the anchors are solid: Along with Binj, we meet a sweet Arab teen, Omar (Kabaha), who unexpectedly becomes a gang target; a younger kid, Malek (Frege), who finds himself on the verge of drug dealing to pay for his mothers bone-marrow transplant; and Dando (Naim), a heavyset Jewish cop and daddy searching for his disappeared brother. Culpability is not ignored in these strands: Everyones a little guilty and the total picture is a vivid one. The combustible movie has had a strangely unifying effect on audiences worldwide; it deserves to find traction where it counts.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Heath Ledgers final onscreen performance, in Terry Gilliams notoriously troubled production, is clearly truncated, despite the semisolution hit upon by the cowriter-director after the actors death. Whenever he ventures into the films amorphous fantasy world, Ledgers charismatic con artist, Tony, is played by Johnny Depp, Jude Law or Colin Farrell. The mechanics of the transformations are sound, but these three last-minute replacements arent able to make the characters journey resonate emotionallythey never fully shake the sense of being <br />stand-ins.</p><p>Fortunately, Tony is more of a supporting player in Gilliams fantasia. The real drama in Parnassus comes from the troupe of sideshow performers, led by a terrifically morbid Christopher Plummer, who bang about modern-day London in a rickety horse-drawn transport that unfolds into an oversize proscenium. Its a film teeming with visual invention (often to the point of exhaustion), yet the big-budget pageantry is always counterbalanced by Gilliams deeply felt and thematically potent sympathy for the downtrodden artistes of the world. And Plummer and Tom Waits (as a bowler-hat-clad Old Scratch) help keep everything on track with their immortals-doing-battle routine, which comes to a deeply affecting head after one of them is reduced to a Lear-like vagrant. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Theres a line from Jurassic Park that echoed hauntingly through this critics head as Avatar unfolded: Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they <i>could</i>, they didnt stop to think if they <i>should</i>. James Cameron is one of those scientists: so in love with the technology, with the possibilities, that he never pauses to reflect upon the practicalities of cinema, of storytelling, of connecting with an audience.<br />That quote is doubly relevant when one considers the cultural similarities between these two blockbusters, both of which justified massive expense by promising a quantum leap forward in visual effects. But where Spielberg utilised technology in the service of a tight, witty script, Cameron is simply out to astound. There are moments when you almost expect Sam Worthingtons moody, ever-present voiceover to be replaced by the self-styled king of the world yelling at his audience: Are you awestruck now? How about now? Now?<br />When his scientist brother is killed a week before shipping out to the distant planet Pandora, wheelchair-bound US Marine Jake Sully (Worthington) is offered the chance to go in his place. On Pandora, Jake meets his avatar, a remote-controlled host body generated from his brothers DNA and designed to blend in among the native Navi, a race of nine-foot blue hunter-gatherers living in peaceful harmony with their homeworld, Native American style.<br />Or rather, Native Californian: Navi civilisation is a mishmash of half-formed Hollywood ideas about the supposed superiority of primitive cultures, tossing around buzzwords like spirit and energy without ever approaching a cohesive set of beliefs. But all this tree-hugging shit, as Jake describes it, is only the most obvious defect in Camerons dire, clich-ridden script. From the bluntly expositional nature of the early scenes to the gung-ho, sub-Aliens banter of Jakes fellow soldiers, this is screenwriting on autopilot, cobbling together unripe ideas without a scrap of originality or emotional resonance. <br />Its hard to fault Avatar as an immersive visual experience. Pandora and its luridly coloured inhabitants are beautifully designed, though none of this ever feels remotely real. But this was  supposed to be the movie that changed the face of filmmaking forever. Ultimately, Camerons signature achievement may have been to prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the oldest of all Hollywood maxims: all the money in the world is no subsitute for fresh ideas and a solid script.]]></review>

Grandchildren assemble around terrible documents; Christiane Kubrick (widow of the famous director and Harlans niece) relates a tale of her Jewish husband feeling like Woody Allen in the propagandists presence. Still a mystery: Harlans own sense of guilt. But theres plenty to go around.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Football fans know that the blind side is the quarterbacks vulnerable spot when hes scouring the field for a pass. Moviegoers attuned to the metaphorical nature of film titles can guess, however, that the phrase applies to more than just grid-irony in John Lee Hancocks based-on-a-true-story parable. Societys blind side, you see, is where impoverished, hulking African-American athlete Big Mike Oher (Aaron) lived until plucky Southern mother Leigh Anne Touhy (Bullock) took him in. (Tough-talking mamas from Tennessee: What <i>cant</i> they fix?) As for the saving glories of the game, youve first got to suffer through an hour of Big Mikes bleached-blond guardian angel dropping saintly Hallmark platitudes. Youve changed his life, one character tells Leigh Anne. No, she says, complete with elongated dramatic pause. Hes changed mine. Garrggh! Just bring on the sports-movie clichs already.</p><p>Its tempting to think that this vanilla take on a stock inspirational tale exists solely to make an expressionistic emotional steamroller like <i>Precious</i> seem even more graceful than it is. Whats worse than its triteness, however, is the way the movie regards this at-risk youth as nothing other than a vehicle for making suburban moms feel better about themselves during the postscreening drive to Costco. Is this some sort of white-guilt thing? a ready-made villain asks rhetorically. Actually, no; its just blinkered middle-class pandering at its most shameless.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Prone to slipping into corny comedy and, worse, confusion over its viewpoint, Michael Hoffmans biopic of Leo Tolstoys final year filters its historical drama through a turgid coming-of-age experience. The authors acolyte Valentin (McAvoy) is commissioned by a literary <br />fanatic (Giamatti) to assist the Russian writer (Plummer) and spy on the households goings-on. At Tolstoys country estate, things become tense thanks to an impending decision to bequeath his work to the public domain and, in doing so, leave his disapproving wifethe Countess Sofya (Mirren)out in the financial cold.</p><p><i>The Last Station </i>never decides if this famous figure is a saint, a loon or merely an infirm old coot being exploited by his followers. Its an indecisiveness that the director extends to his misshapen characterizations of the frequently freaking-out countess and the virginal Valentin, whose education in love is embellished by a drearily cute penchant for sneezing when nervous. Working with uneven material, the illustrious cast is too often stranded in a realm of tony, high-art campnotably a hammy Plummer and Mirren suffering through a foreplay scene that requires the celebrated veteran actors to crazily coo cock-a-doodle-doos to each other. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Its bad enough that Nancy Meyers latest conventional romcom is blessed with a title so bluntly unimaginative as to seem facetious; the rub is that its not even a truthful assessment. Divorced baker Jane (Streep) embarks on an unexpected and ill-advised affair with her former husband, Jake (Baldwin). As this swaggering ex is now married to a hot young psycho (Bell) and Jane <br />is also falling for her dorky architect (Martin), this amorous development supposedly turns circumstances knotty. Yet in Meyerss milquetoast hands, the way the scenario plays out isnt so much tricky as treacly, with sporadic bursts of sitcom goofiness.</p><p>The writer-directors rickety portrait of middle-aged loneliness, regret and self-consciousness is propped up by Streep and Baldwins natural love-hate chemistry and joint refusal to succumb to slapsticky ridiculousness. Nonetheless, a greater focus on off-the-wall humor would have benefited Martin, whos shamefully saddled with being the plots perfunctory third wheel. More mirth and less tear-streaked schmaltz might have alleviated the tales dramedy dawdling, as Meyers goes to such unnecessary lengths to craft allegedly complex protagonists that the comedy soon goes down like lead. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>For those of us who find somber superhero movies faintly ridiculous, <i>Kick-Ass</i> is a one-film justice league. It might be the best recruiting tool the geek squad ever had, puncturing fanboyish obsessions and reinvesting them with passion. Slyly, the movie starts off with a sick joke—an awful skyscraper leap by a pretender in a winged costume. (Too bad the title Jackass was already taken.) Only a little later, our self-admittedly bland high-school hero, Dave (the likeable Johnson), buys a turquoise scuba suit and quickly finds himself gut-stabbed by amused thugs. Peter Parker had it easy.</p><p><i>Kick-Ass,</i> briskly adapted by British screenwriter Jane Goldman and director Matthew Vaughn from Mark Millar’s savage comic, has a lot more on its mind than approximating a live-action Wile E. Coyote sketch. Dave dangerously accrues fame through a cruddy viral video, resulting in plenty of innocent carnage. Meanwhile, real-life criminals get pissed off and the laughs start to hang in your throat. Vaughn (<i>Stardust</i>) knows he’s on to more of a giddy-nauseating satire of vigilantism than anything square-jawed; he lunges at ideas of unearned celebrity via a pot-smoking spoiled supervillain called the Red Mist (Mintz-Plasse, seriously upping the ante from <i>Superbad</i>’s McLovin). </p><p>By the time we get around to a stunning 11-year-old (Moretz) chopping the legs off goons with amoral glee, it’s hard to miss the subversive point—that ass-kicking fantasies make more sense as the ambitions of sugar-addled kids. (Expect gasps.) The emotions, however, are adult-sized: A paternal turn from Nicolas Cage is a hint of what his aborted Superman might have been—an overwrought hoot. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Bridges, for all his glorious achievements, still hasnt been celebrated enough. A technical actor (remember <i>Starman</i>?) who manages to make every gesture a perfect one, hes been paired with difficult material over a meandering career and always succeeded. So if this better-than-average country-singer tale does the trick come Oscar time, heres someone who wont complain. Bad Blake, much like Bridgess immortal Dude, is belly-acting: gutsy and, well, big-gutted. The number of times Blake is seen emerging from a pickup truck with his belt unfastened is almost a running joke. Rambling through a series of Texas bars and vomiting behind them, Blake is haunted by a musical protg whos become a huge star (Farrell). His own glory days are long behind him.</p><p><i>Crazy Heart</i> pairs this fascinating private strummer with a curious journalist (Gyllenhaal), who soon shares with him a bed and the affections of her daddyless young son. For the movies first hour, you perk up at the vibrations of sympathetic emotions, pitched at a quiet frequency not heard since <i>Tender Mercies.</i> (The appearance of Robert Duvall is a bonus.) Upsettingly, though, someones decided that such intimate moments are not enough for a night of entertainment, so a manufactured kid-in-jeopardy climax and Blakes rehab stint blow the mood. Until then, this is great American acting.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>pologies to all of you whove been looking forward to Lewis Carroll getting the Tim Burton treatment. For this loose amalga-daptation of both<i> Alices Adventures in Wonderland </i>and <i>Through the Looking-Glass,</i> Burton is in dispassionate, for-hire mode, which means hes more concerned with computer-generated eyesores than with the character, Alice Kingsley (Wasikowska), whose subconscious theyre meant to represent.</p><p>Alice is no longer a girl, but a woman in her late teens facing an arranged marriage to a snooty stick-in-the-mud. While mulling her situation, our heroine is drawn back to Wonderland by the White Rabbit. Its there that a prophecy is unveiled (damn prophecies!) saying Alice will slay the monstrous Jabberwock, whos been terrorizing the land at the behest of the literally big-headed Red Queen (Carter).</p><p>Save the terrific<i> Sweeney Todd</i>, Burton hasnt convincingly visualized a dreamworld since his mid-90s heyday. The grounding psychology of his fantastical characterslike his two Eds, Wood and Scissorhandshas eluded him since hes gone green screen. Its especially damaging in this case, since the Alice novels are all about a girls inner life made animate. </p><p>Wasikowska certainly looks the part, but we never get the sense that this placeor playth, as Johnny Depps lisping, unmemorable Mad Hatter might sayand its populace spring from her psyche. Shes basically lost on a Burtons Greatest Hits ride at Disney World, where even an ostensibly inventive character like the films toothy, dematerializing Cheshire Cat feels like a weightless derivative of the directors more tangible past creations. And unlike Carrolls perversely idealized protagonist, Burtons Alice is just another anachronistic feminist tearing down Victorian patriarchal norms. Even her[<i>shudder</i>]Avril Lavigneblared theme song is a skin-deep grrrl-power accessory.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Foxs foray into Bollywood examines the fallout of 9/11 on NRIs (Non Resident Indians) in Bushs America. Khan (Shah Rukh Khan), a Muslim man with Aspergers syndrome, travels across the USA in order to meet the President. My Name is Khan; I am not a terrorist is his mantra. Karan Johar, Bollywoods biggest director, admirably addresses a sensitive topical issue within the widest commercial context. He incorporates marital strife, communal conflict, racism, bullying, a mamma subplot, and a catchy soundtrack (frustratingly not subtitled) to convey his progressive agenda. The result is a film of tonal inconsistency which reflects its simplistic good people/bad people view of human nature. Technically accomplished, its always engaging due to the credible performances from its beautiful leads, the charismatic Khan and Kajol. Worthy, but flawed.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Lie to us, we ask on this pinkest of holidays. Tenderize us until were raw and chompable. This is why a director like <i>Pretty Woman</i>s Garry Marshall even has a career to begin with, so woe be to those who enter his manically upbeat ensemble comedy, <i>Valentines Day,</i> with dark clouds overhead. Even the movies designated sad sacks (notably an inexplicably lonely Jessica Biel, who turns in a small miracle of nervousness) have long-telegraphed happy endings in store by the close of the day. A florist (Kutcher) grapples with his engagement rejection while his cute best friend (Garner) bites her lower lip in sympathy. A secret phone-sex worker (Hathaway) is career-outed in front of her uptight boyfriend; will he melt in understanding? (Hint: Hes played by Topher Grace.) As L.A. stories go, were a long way from Robert Altmans <i>Short Cuts.</i></p><p>And still: The surprising thing here is how smoothly this over-iced cake goes down. You know youre getting schmaltz, but as with Britains obvious forebear <i>Love Actually</i> (2003), there are enough tart lines and gestures to elicit a certain admiration. The feisty Shirley MacLaine plays one scene in front of her sylphlike, younger selfprojected behind her on an outdoor movie screenand its todays incarnation that grabs you. Blond awards-magnet Taylor Swift reveals an unexpected gift for self-deprecating sunniness, chattering vacantly in an elevator to a stranger. And even Marshalls megawatt beamer, Julia Roberts, turns in a smart cameo as a returning soldier. But of all of them, Ill take the waiter in a bruised mood, who sullenly declares, Ill come backwhen youre serious. Hell be waiting a while.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Every so often, you get the gift of watching an under-the-radar actor bloom into a critical-mass phenomenon before your bloodshot eyes: Franka Potente in <i>Run Lola Run</i>, or Christoph Waltz in <i>Inglourious Basterds</i>. Add Noomi Rapace to the list; what she does with the title character of this Swedish thriller-cum-pop-lit-adaptation will spawn cults of swooning Rapacephiles stat. Of course, the heroine of Stieg Larssons Scandi-noir best-sellerthe first volume of his megapopular Millennium trilogywas hardwired for instant iconic status, but lets not damn with faint praise. After watching this wispy young woman dig her talons into the goth-garbed, bisexual biker-chick hacker Lisbeth Salander, youll have witnessed a star being brn. <br /></p><p>Lisbeth is just a piece of director Niels Arden Oplevs deep, degenerate puzzle, even if she eclipses everything around her. A disgraced journalist (Nyqvist) is hired to investigate a decades-old mystery; photographs contain clues, biblical passages are codes, and the scribe and his pierced, pixie-ish sidekick race around trying to find out whodunit. Oplev himself speeds through the storys plot twists like hes on deadline, but importantly, the filmmaker nails the books indictment of the sexual-predatory vibes seemingly embedded in Swedens landscape. Vengeance, however, will be Lisbeths; just give this abused hellion a tattoo gun, a camcorder and an actor who can bring her to screaming, sucker-punching life. Mission accomplished. <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Were so used to amped-up white-knucklers that the controlled approach of a filmmaker like Roman Polanski is immediately seductive. The director responsible for such mainstays as <i>Chinatown</i> and <i>Rosemarys Baby</i> (and of course his own real-life news cycle) turns Robert Harriss political potboiler involving a ghostwriter (McGregor), a former British prime minister (Brosnan) and an isolated island home into a slow-burn near-masterpiece. Shot in claustrophobic widescreen, the film showcases Polanskis mastery of even expository scenes: A revealing conversation between McGregors so-called ghost and a shady figure played by Tom Wilkinson is so fraught with tension that you expect those malevolent Cocteau-esque hands from<i> Repulsion</i> to burst out of the wall and drag someone into oblivion. <br />The film stays more grounded than that, though it certainly doesnt lack for perverse Polanski flourishes. Theres a great bit of carnal business with the prime ministers wife (Williams) thats filmed in a deadpan long shot. Eli Wallach pops upfrail-looking though spiritedas an old-timer who stokes the writers paranoia about his employers plans for him. And more than one character has a wry aside on the protagonists heritage (Oh, you Brits!), as if it was both a badge of honor and a reason for condescending suspicion. <br />There are all number of similarly colorful touches (the sick-joke ending alone is worth the price of admission) that help to deepen what one colleague suggested is the greatest airport novel ever filmed. Its true that <i>The Ghost Writer</i> doesnt possess the lingering profundity of the directors best workthe War on Terror window dressing is just that. Yet Polanski has made a genre piece with a verve and vitality thats in sadly short supply. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Not since a Nam-scarred Sly Stallone asked, Do we get to win this time? in <i>Rambo: First Blood Part II </i>has an American action star been deployed to rewrite history so thoroughly. Matt Damon, while only an Army warrant officer in the ridiculous <i>Green Zone,</i> gets pretty mouthy in his futile search for Iraqi WMDs: This intelligence is bullshit! he informs superiors and slower viewers. Going rogue, the character shocks a Judith Miller reporter type (Ryan) into conscience, shouts down a Rumsfeldian Washington worm (Kinnear) and tries to spring a prisoner from an Abu Ghraiblike compound. A CIA fat cat (Gleeson) ogles babes by the pool in the protected zone while the real deal goes down in night vision. Ultimately, a heroic e-mail will be sent to the worlds journalists, certain to publish the truth. Aw, yeah: the power of the presswith backbone!</p><p>Lets not blame Rajiv Chandrasekaran, author of the credited 2006 source account, Imperial Life in the Emerald City (much goosed by inspired screenwriter Brian Helgeland), for the misfire. The real disappointer is director Paul Greengrass, who, with United 93 and his earlier Bloody Sunday, pulled off small miracles of tact. Greengrass is better known for the last two Bourne moviesagain, superior fantasies inspired by modern terror. <i>Green Zone,</i> though, has him fumbling mightily, grabbing for big moments with shockingly dumb dialogue (Dont be naive!) and turning the Iraq War into a Bond film. The director still cuts footage with the deftness of a jazz player, and some might consider this to be his most daring, idealistic movie; its like a big, revisionist do-over. Alas, hes pushed himself into a weightless place where his skills are moot.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Desperation oozes from every frame of <i>Cop Out,</i> which front-loads its best jokean aerial pan from Manhattan to Kings County scored with the Beastie Boys No Sleep Till Brooklynthen spends the rest of its running time endlessly spinning its wheels. Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan are partners in law out to recover a stolen baseball card from some badass Hispanic gangsters. How we arrive at that golden nugget of a plot complication is something for the Robert McKees of the world to illuminate; for the rest of us, this is some soul-sapping dada with which director Kevin Smith is staining his already-dubious rsum.</p><p>The actors constantly indulge in unfocused improv: Morgan is given what feels like a full reel to unleash an unfunny succession of re-created film scenes, each followed by a reaction shot of Willis telling us what said scene is supposed to be (<i>Heat!; The Color Purple!</i>). The camera later fleetingly catches game supporting actor Kevin Pollak doing a spot-on De Niro impersonation, and its like seeing the difference between mastery and cacophony. Nearly all the jokes are spewed as if they were a barrage of bullets. Thats fitting, since this purported comedy is also senselessly violent: Guns are fired with reckless abandon. Blood is carelessly spilled. And amid all the carnage, were supposed to give a damn about whether Morgans wife is cheating on him and if Willis can give his daughter a dream wedding on a cops salary. Then theres the Seann William Scott stoner scenes, but, really, why prolong the torment? <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Taking a page from the <i>Dawn of the Dead </i>04 playbook, this entertainingly shallow remake of George A. Romeros 1973 horror film opens with a clever use of Johnny Cash (crooning the Dr. <i>Strangelove</i>closing ditty, Well Meet Again), then jumps right into the societal breakdown. A man goes nuts at a baseball game. Our hero sheriff (Olyphant) shoots him through the noggin. Seems theres a destructive force, later determined to be a government-engineered virus, working its way through this small Midwest American town.</p><p>Director Breck Eisner (<i>Sahara</i>) has a talent for in-the-moment tension (theres some pretty memorable business with a pitchfork and an autopsy saw), and it often feels like the characters are plunging headlong through a grisly Rube Goldberg gauntlet. All of which is a lot of fun, until the realization sets in that very little is going on beyond the fright-feature anxieties.Unlike Romeros film, whats missing is a trenchant sense of connection to our historical moment. The original <i>Crazies</i> perceptively shuttled back and forth between bureaucratically hampered Army men and a paranoid populace; it had Vietnam firmly on its mind. Here, the goal is clearthe sheriff and his pregnant wife (Mitchell) need to get the fuck out of Dodgebut the world around them is a half-baked hash of antimilitarist sentiment and goosey jump-scares: Operation Iraqi Hodgepodge.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>A far cry from the gritty 70s policiers it conjures with cock-of-the-walk swagger (<i>Serpico, Prince of the City</i>), Antoine Fuquas second-rate retread of his own <i>Training Day</i> is a bloated, multithread drama concerning three burnt-out cops at the end of their seemingly unconnected ropes. Just a week away from receiving his pension, spiritually ruined man-in-blue Eddie (Gere) would rather let crime run rampant than do paperwork; he wakes up each morning to a glass of whiskey and a cocked gun in his mouth. Then theres Officer Tango (Cheadle), whose undercover duty has been so overextended that his loyalties and moral compass have shifted to protect his gangland pal Caz (Snipes). Yes, weve seen that type of hot mess before. And gee, will underpaid narcotics cop Sal (Hawke) ditch his few remaining scruples to make the down payment on a new house for his baby mama, pregnant with twins?</p><p>Across the board, the capable cast of <i>Brooklyns Finest</i> works hard to sell a soulful intensity, which isnt easy considering that each of the leads could proclaim theyre getting too old for this shit at any given moment. Unsubtly scripted by former NYC transit worker Michael C. Martin, the film plays like the inverse of <i>Crash</i>a faux-intricate exercise in crosscutting fatalism that points fingers at its characters rather than the audience. Rock bottom is never as close as it appears and what goes around comes around (and all that noise), but for a character-driven piece digging up old tropes about the strains of humanity buried within corrupted people, the constant threat of violence seems to be its only dramatic momentum.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hollywoods campaign to convince audiences that beefy Scots bulldog Gerard Butler can play the romantic lead gathers pace with this misjudged marital crime caper. Butler plays Milo Boyd, an ex-cop turned bail bondsman assigned to haul in his ex-wife Nicole (Jennifer Aniston), a hotshot reporter in deep with the law. The pursuit takes this pair of bickering exes from New York to Atlantic City and back, via a series of perfunctory car chases, poorly choreographed punch-ups and excruciating romantic entanglements.<br />The trouble is not so much that Butler isnt funny  he isnt, even slightly  but that he sucks the merest hint of humour from the entire enterprise. Even proven performers like Aniston and Christine Baranski as a sexually voracious mother-in-law are reduced to desperate mugging and hysterical arm-waving in an attempt to fill the comic vacuum which their muscular co-star leaves in his wake. To be fair, the script gives them little to work with: there are maybe three decent laughs, interspersed with long stretches of interminable, would-be witty banter and one near-unwatchable comedy torture scene. <br />The score, too, is atrocious: infuriatingly cheeky in the comedy scenes, switching to screeching Bon Jovi-esque AOR whenever things kick off. The Bounty Hunter isnt bad enough to be offensive: its simply lazy, trite, smug, irritating and a colossal waste of time, talent and money. Therell be worse films released in 2010  but not many.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Jay Baruchel is the gentlest of the Apatow geeklings, more a mascot to sweathogs like Seth Rogen than an equal. (His spindly boxer in <i>Million Dollar Baby</i> looked beatable by even Hilary Swank.) So it makes sense that Baruchels first star vehicle, a twitchy, frequently funny affair, emphasizes the scrawn factor: <i>Shes Out of My League</i> casts him as a polite Pittsburgh airport-security worker, Kirk, dwarfed by the epaulets on his uniform and the pushy advice of his man-gang. When a bombshell traveler, Molly (Eve), makes her way through the gate, shes seen as a human being only by Kirk, who returns her iPhone and boggles at the possibility of her being attracted to him.</p><p>You might feasibly expectindeed, hope forthis to play out like a zanier <i>Say Anything </i>(judging from Baruchels rawness, he does, too). But were hardly in that romantic ballpark; the promising material, penned by the writers of the underrated <i>Sex Drive,</i> skews closer to Farrelly brothers slapstick than sweetness. One gag involving a loving act of manscaping by a heterosexual friend will make you want to vomit; you sense that<i> The Hangover</i> loomed large over this production. Still, Eve has a true flair for zingers, and the movies heart survives intact. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Fathers know foolishness best in this culture-clash family comedy, which presides over a cursed union of slushy sentimentality and dim-witted humor. Two lovebirds (Gross, Ferrera) wreak havoc among their clans by announcing their intentions to marry. Such news is upsetting to their respective not-so-proud popsa playboy radio personality (Whitaker) and a clingy car restorer (Mencia)who immediately begin volleying racial and class-based insults at each other.<br /></p><p>Paternal bickering and egomaniacal prejudices soon give way to slapstick fighting, which in turn leads to clichd crises (the couple starts to reconsider their relationship, other relatives find love amid the matrimonial chaos) and Kumbaya reconciliations that are as predictable as the scripts intolerant slurs are tame. A variety of peripheral players fulfill the stereotype quota, with African-Americans represented as party-hearty lotharios and Mexicans cast as traditionalist kooks. Aside from an uncomfortable-looking Carlos Mencia, who seems to actively cower before the camera, the cast is robotically efficientthough thats not the same thing as coming out of this lifeless mess unscathed. Itll take years of yeomans work for Forest Whitaker to repair his onscreen reputation after allowing himself to be humped by a runaway goat hopped up on Viagra.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Theres tons of brooding for your buck in the hilariously earnest <i>Remember Me,</i> which will hopefully be revived several years from now as a beloved midnight movie. <i>Twilight</i> inamorato Robert Pattinson (star and executive producer) confidently sulks his way through this jaw-dropping mix of come-hither stares, love me, Daddy! histrionics and historical tragedy. <br />Hes Tyler Hawkins, a gloomily soulful NYU student at odds with his businessman father (Brosnan), and who cracks Boyz II Men jokes as if he were Allen Ginsberg reading Howl.

One alpha-male bet with his roommate later, Tylers on a retributive datebut then love begins to bloom. </p><p>Sex is had, past secrets are revealed, but all is not well in Camelot, as director Allen Coulter and writer Will Fetters shamelessly hint via snatches of summer 2001 news broadcasts (its a period piece, see) and a telegraphing glimpse at a certain pair of buildings. I cant say any more beyond telling you that I came out of the screening with an ear-to-ear grin I dont usually get from even great movies.

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Once upon a time, a nebbishy New Yorker could fall for a willowy shiksa goddess and you could call it <i>Annie Hall.</i> No longer. Now, the whole movies got to be set in Los Angeles (not just one Christmas sequence), our love object barely gets a single la-di-da, and forget about naming the film after her. Weve got inner male pain to address.<br /></p><p>That shift, though, is precisely what makes<i> Greenberg,</i> Noah Baumbachs latest comedy-drama, so car-crash-arresting and emblematic of Gen X self-absorption. Baumbach, an expert at skewering urbane pretensions (<i>The Squid and the Whale</i>), has conceived a remarkably sour character in Ben Stillers furious letter writer and fortyish layabout, Roger Greenberg. Once a college-rock musician, he scotched his bands momentum in a fit of principle and now suffers the consequences: occasional work at carpentry and pride-swallowing in the home of his much wealthier brother. A ratty Steve Winwood T-shirt speaks volumes, as does a shelf of meds and a constant stream of bile directed at partygoing kids who scare him with their potential. Rogers just not fun to be around.</p><p>Baumbachs idea here is to find an expiration date on boyishnessits tempting to compare Greenberg to the more-trenchant <i>The Anniversary Party</i> (2001), also a shrewd examination of the limits of youthful decadence (and partly created by the filmmakers wife, Jennifer Jason Leigh, as is this). This movie corrects its wobbly, negative spiral with the romantic development of Florence (Gerwig, spacey as ever), a personal assistant to Rogers sib and perhaps a salvation. Scratch that perhaps: <i>Greenberg</i> only slightly misses the top flight by settling for too weak a foil. (The better option, Rhys Ifanss bruised bandmate, is right there.) But when Stiller indulges in moments of unfulfilled rage, this has real desperation. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For the past year, 3D has been a guarantee of box-office gold, as proven by the runaway success of Avatar. But now, for the first time, a film arrives for which the 3D element may prove to be a commercial hindrance. Its not only that Clash of the Titans will compete with Alice in Wonderland, How to Train Your Dragon and Avatar for the nations 3D screens. More critically than that, the film's conversion to 3D (a decision taken late in the filmmaking process) has rendered this campy, unashamedly old-school but still highly enjoyable blockbuster rather painful to watch.<br />In story terms, Clash of the Titans doesn't stray too far from the beloved 1981 Ray Harryhausen classic which spawned it. The setting is mythical Ancient Greece  an age of Gods, monsters and muscular men in little chainmail skirts. Sam Worthington is Perseus, an orphaned demi-God drawn into the battle between man and the immortals when Hades (Ralph Fiennes), lord of the underworld, threatens to unleash his great sea-beast, the Kraken, on the city of Argos. Accompanied by a ragtag band of warriors, Perseus sets off to learn the secrets of the Kraken and end the reign of the Gods once and for all.<br />Theres no ignoring the fact that Clash of the Titans is a mess: the plot is episodic and rushed, the dialogue blunt and occasionally laughable, and there are far too many characters, few of whom leave much of an impression. Both Worthington and love interest Gemma Arterton look like theyre on a strenuous Aegean package holiday, but luckily theyre surrounded by the likes of Fiennes, Pete Postlethwaite and Liam Neeson as Zeus, whose commanding, armour-clad presence seems, at times, to be the only thing holding this crumbling edifice together.<br />Other notable names dont fare so well: Danny Huston gets a mighty fake beard but just one line as sea-God Poseidon, Mads Mikkelsen does little more than bare his teeth as burly swordsman Draco and, most egregiously, Jason Flemyng gets a terrific backstory and some superb melting-face makeup as ruined ruler Calibos  and that's it. It's is a recurring problem throughout the film: with dialogue and character motivation cut back to the bare minimum, theres no way for anyone to express themselves except through action.<br />But, luckily, this is where Clash of the Titans succeeds. Whatever the flaws in the script, theres no faulting director Louis Leterriers visual ambition: this is a film of mighty vistas, beautifully designed beasts and intense, well-structured combat sequences, all rendered in eye-popping, though still rather fake-looking, CGI. Taking the lessons of The Lord of the Rings to heart, Leterrier goes all-out for excess: his computer-generated camera soars above sprawling cities, endless deserts and blasted underworld hellscapes, lending the film a dizzying, epic scale.<br />A shame, then, that the addition of 3D has rendered much of this grandeur all but unwatchable, blurring the image to a headache-inducing degree and adding absolutely nothing to a film which was obviously shot in two dimensions and should have stayed that way. As an experiment in high-Hollywood style over substance, Clash of the Titans is a very entertaining ride. But take our advice: sidestep the 3D and see it the old fashioned way. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Wasnt it only yesterday that Dakota Fanning shrieked her way into your splitting headache in <i>War of the Worlds</i>? She was just 11 back then, and in this fast-and-loose dramatization of the flameout of the 1970s proto-grrrl group, shes all of 15. Fannings costar, vamp bait Kristen Stewart, isnt that much more experienced (she can vote). The two make for an uncomfortably tarted-up frontline as, respectively, blond yowler Cherie Currie and future-bad-reputation-disregarder Joan Jett. Its exactly as it should be; the bands story is a cautionary one. So if you feel yourself getting protective, the movie is doing its job.</p><p>The two underage characters meet, naturally, in a bar over drinks, shoved together by creepy L.A. entrepreneur Kim Fowley (<i>Revolutionary Road</i>s Shannon, the only truly anarchic presence in the whole film). Soon enough, theyre crammed into a motor home with the rest of the band, working on chord ch-ch-changes and sliding inexorably toward drugs, soft-core lesbian sex and Japanese fame. As styled by video director Floria Sigismondi, the film mainly glances on these surfacesits more giggly goofy than coke-in-the-bathroom naughty. (Only vinyl collectors will insist that a serious legacy has been sullied; the plot is as contrived as the group itself.)So you dont blink an eye when the prefab wheels run off the railstheres very little pathos here for something presumably informed by Curries 1989 memoir. Still, you do get a sense of the moment when glam was being fought out in American high schools, and teen sex was barely contained in tight pants. Theres lots of volume in these tunesthe soundtrack is killerand at least everyone gets their rocks off. <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Who would think that a sleepy seaside snippet of the Bronx could foster a Faulkner novels worth of family skeletons? Vince Rizzo (Garcia) is a prison warden guarding two big secrets from his family: a moonlighting stint as an aspiring actor, and Tony (Strait), a grown son from a past fling who shows up as an inmate. Our guilt-ridden everyman takes probationary custody of his close-relations convict, setting off a chain of mishaps: Tony proceeds to make eyes at both Vinces wife (Margulies) and his teen daughterwhos secretly stripping to pay for collegewhile urging Vinces teen son to indulge his online fetish for obese women.</p><p>Somehow, writer-director Raymond De Felitta pulls off these proceedings way better than anyone has a right to, thanks to his light touch with potentially lurid plot developments and his generosity in letting actors flesh out their sitcom setups. Strait, a heartthrob in the making, almost steals the film from Garcia, who channels outer-borough local affably, if a bit thickly. Theres an inevitable clusterfuck climax of accumulated secrets that explode into histrionics, but what precedes the heavily accented sturm und drang is handled with delightful deft.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Well concede the point: This collection of testimonials from North Korean escapees is no Sunday-afternoon stroll, but it is a horrifying-fascinating peek into a hermit kingdom thats a bigger mystery than life on other planets. Kim Jong Ils dictatorship and its prison camps are sketched in a portrait of communist tailspin that evokes the most medieval moments of the 20th century. Obviously, this is not a tough case for a filmmaker to make, especially with geopolitics off the table and other aspects of the totalitarian country having already been explored in other docs (e.g.,<i> The Red Chapel</i>). But the first-person accounts here are vividthe terrors of starvation, slavery and midnight flight. One mans escape was inspired by a smuggled copy of <i>The Count of Monte Cristo;</i> a typical story begins, The first time I ate a mouse"</p><p>Director N.C. Heikin sympathetically wraps things in piano music and dance sequences that suggest bodily freedom; its not an entirely successful gambit, and gives the movie an unpolished insistence. But the filmmaker strikes gold in her varied selection of defectors, especially the military man fed up with the myopic chain of command. Nutty propaganda reels are here too, naturally, but even that glorious-leader kitsch screams prison camp more than camp.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The 3D bandwagon keeps rolling with this smart, muscular, animated adventure. On a remote North Atlantic island, the Viking population is suffering harassment from swarms of marauding dragons, until geeky son-of-a-chief Hiccup finds an injured dragon in the woods and suspects this constant state of warfare may be unnecessary.<br />Rejecting the comic whimsy of Cressida Cowells source novel, How to Train Your Dragon is a surprisingly robust affair, backing its juggernaut narrative with a well-judged and timely political subtext which urges young viewers to question received wisdom and make up their own minds, especially when it comes to matters of life and death. The voices can be jarring  the burly adult Vikings are all Scots, while their offspring are whiny Yanks  and the characterisation remains disappointingly old fashioned and unoriginal. But the visuals are striking, the script sharp and well paced and it all wraps up with a breathtaking aerial battle sequence.]]></review>

The film pitches friend against friend as Law ends up with a new ticker and darts about town with fellow post-op target Alice Braga in tow. Ideas, excitement and logic are ditched in favour of blood and gore  and theres no fun to be had watching operations and knife fights. Law and Whitaker are disastrous in the lead roles.

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The epitome of Frances early-80s <i>cinma du look,</i> Jean-Jacques Beineixs thriller was a flipped bird to those who thought the country produced only artsy-fartsy ruminations on angst. Why, no! cried the young director. We can also make Euroslick eye candy, and heres exhibit A.</p><p></p><p>Though the storyinvolving an obsessive opera fan (Andri), a prima donna (Fernandez), corrupt cops, music pirates and the ol incriminating-tape-slipped-in-a-bag chestnutis somehow both convoluted and wafer-thin, <i>Diva</i> has other things working in its favor. Only a blind man would argue that cinematographer Philippe Rousselots visuals dont wow on a primitive level, especially once the sleek-chic shadows start dominating the screen and the geometric neon fashions nudge the movie toward Nagel territory. Youd also have to be a serious killjoy to shrug off the films extraordinary chase scene through the Metro or deny that Dominique Pinons performance as a diminutive punk henchman is damned near iconic.</p><p></p><p>But lets say youd like something out of <i>Diva</i> other than bright lights and big aesthetics borrowed from Hollywoods playbook. We wish you luck. Admirers can counter that the films style is its substance <i>[Yawn],</i> yet that still doesnt make this anything more than an elaborate, subtitled exercise in blowing hot air. Time hasnt changed that one bit.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Set in a pregentrified Park Slope, Hal Ashbys provocative Me Decade dramedy isnt as clueless as its protagonist is about cultural clashes. It may, however, be just as conflicted about color and class. Audiences are immediately invited to ridicule Elgar Enders (a baby-faced Bridges), who purchases a tenement in Brooklyn on a larkespecially once the Caucasian casually announces that the current African-American occupants must vacate.</p><p>Before we can properly affix our sneers of superiority, however, we meet Elgars superficial family (the scene becomes even more squirm-inducing when Bridges decries their racismby dumping soup on a <i>black</i> manservant) and watch the community were supposed to sympathize with demonstrate a painfully righteous hostility. His relationship with a woman (Bey) of mixed race, laced with genuine tenderness, and another sexual liaison that echoes earlier plantation owner accusations only muddy the waters further. Then Lee Grant and Pearl Bailey bond over ham hocks and hooch. Dont get me started on Robert Klein with burnt cork smeared all over his mug.</p><p>An elder spokesman of New Hollywoods vanguard, former editor Hal Ashbys debut film keeps veering away from expectations and easy answers: Sharp satire might suddenly segue into Norman Lear sitcom territory, while social problems remain unsolved when the credits roll. The movies too flawed to be a true neglected masterpiece or a satisfying time capsule for a hood whose boutiques-and-brownstones makeover speaks volumes. Yet <i>The Landlord</i>s view on the racial divide remains anything but black and white, and its knotty, nuanced take on where the twain cant meet deserves a reassessment.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>If theres anything less funny than suicide, its the notion that the afterlife is a simulacrum of ones pre-offed existence in which everything is a little bit worse (for instance, there are no stars and no one smiles). But Goran Dukics shaggy yet assured <i>Wristcutters </i>manages to draw humor and warmth from just such a premise, while finding pathos in what couldve been a vapid, high-concept lark.</p><p>Based on a 1998 short story by Israeli writer Etgar Keret, the film concerns Zia (Fugit), a stroppy twentysomething whos bumming around the suspiciously L.A.-like purgatory when he discovers that his beloved ex-girlfriend has also done herself in. He embarks on a quest to find her, along with devoted Russian sleazeball Eugene (Whigham) and a beguiling hitchhiker (Sossamon) who may be in limbo by accident. The trio ultimately arrives at a camp run by a crusty sage (Waits), at which point the sly jokes begin to give way to twee magical realism. <i>Wristcutters</i> is redeemed throughout, however, by Croatian-born Dukics darkly absurdist sensibility and bittersweet understanding that despair is tragically, hilariously portable. Fittingly, it ends with a pair of hard-earned, heart-melting smiles</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It begins in the aftermath of battle. Lone survivor General Pang (Jet Li) staggers from the wreckage a changed man, vowing to conquer China and end centuries of bloodshed and infighting. For Western audiences, the popular rebirth of Eastern cinema has been eye-opening. This represents another peak in that development, taking a familiar lust-for-glory narrative and investing it with boundless energy and drive.<br /><br />Side-stepping the cold-steel visual perfection of Hero and the fairytale detachment of Crouching Tiger, the film hews closer to Spartacus, revelling in gloriously directed slash-and-burn battle sequences as Pang and his bandit brothers cut a gory swathe across the continent. But the film becomes more pensive and emotionally rewarding in the final act, shedding the mythic trappings and becoming a tragedy, as our broken heroes learn the corrupting influence of power.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Initially, the stop-motion animated feature $9.99 resembles one of those foulmouthed <i>Davey and Goliath</i> parodies from <i>Mad TV.</i> Yet as the first sequence makes abundantly clear, director Tatia Rosenthal and screenwriter Etgar Keret arent poking funtheyre deadly serious. A semiabsurdist dialogue between white-collar worker Jim Peck (LaPaglia) and a bearded homeless man (Rush) builds to a blood-splattering punch line that decisively sets the films melancholic tone. Animation is so often used for frivolous flights of fancy that its something of a shock to see it employed in the service of a tale that emphasizes human foible and mortality. </p><p>Thats not to say <i>$9.99</i> lacks for bizarre sights: The homeless man sprouts angel wings; a pot-addled slacker converses with three Lilliputian drunkards; a muscled repo man reinvents himself as a hairless blob to please his model girlfriend. These world-weary characters, all of whom live in or around the same apartment building, may be grounded in earthly problems and pursuits, but the fantastic always intrudes. The films title is the price of a self-help book, purchased by Jims neer-do-well son, Dave (Johnson), which promises to reveal the meaning of life. Happiness, or at least a happy ending, would seem to be the ultimate goal for everyone involved. Yet Rosenthal and Keret consistently play on audience expectations, especially in the recurring image of a piggy bank with an endearing yet horrifyingly fixed facial expression. Its cute beyond belief, but we keep waiting for the damn thing to spring to life and bare a sharp set of teeth. Theres a fine line, it would seem, between uplift and insanity.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>There are those of us who can watch the brainy Tiny Fey bobble around <i>30 Rock</i>
for hours, and drink up her every self-deprecating zinger like freshly
brewed espresso. (As for the others who dont get herwe understand
Sarah Palin has a new show.) Still, theres no reason Fey, so dynamic
on the small screen, has to get Anistoned out of a proper Hollywood
crossover. <i>Baby Mama</i> (2008) was cringingly mediocre; indeed, one has to cast back to 2004s tangy, Fey-scripted <i>Mean Girls</i> to get a reasonable glimmer of her talent. Even then, we were still watching Lindsay Lohan.</p><p><i>Date Night</i>
isnt going to alter this conundrumit makes you laugh in fits and
starts, but more often it feels toothless and exhausted, the kind of
project that exists to give Ray Liotta work. (The generic script is by <i>Shrek</i>-sequel
scribe Josh Klausner.) Fey is almost perfectly paired with Steve Carell as
bored, married New Jerseyites Claire and Phil: The way they trade quips
and cast snide aspersions at strangers, the actors seem totally
believable as intellectual mates and, more crucially, deeply in danger
of losing intimacy. After stealing a reservation at a clichd-snobby
NYC eatery, the couple are mistaken for blackmailers and pursued by
goons, <i>North by Northwest</i>style, throughout the city.</p><p>You
know where this is going; shouty misadventures in a slow-moving
motorboat, a clamorous car chase and an exclusive sex club will surely
move them out of the most excellent roommates category. When Mark Wahlberg
shows up as a shirtless tech-heavy spyone who can also flirt in
Hebrewhe almost constitutes a joke in himself. But cant there at
least be faster fish for Fey and Carell to shoot in the barrel?</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Less an evenings entertainment than a glittering bear trap, Stephen Sondheims subversive 1979 Broadway triumph bristled with the composers spikiest dissonances. By the end of the first half, a vengeful serial killer was happily twirling with the woman who baked his victims into meat pies. By curtain, all of London seemed charred by apocalyptic fire: sick with amorality and, its safe to say, indigestion.</p><p>Much of that musical is heresmartly condensed, if slightly less sooty, under the pop-gothic glare of Tim Burton. For that unlikely outcome alone, <i>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</i> merits a nod, and not just from the <i>Saw</i> crowd. (Brace yourself for multiple neck slashings.) As is his want, Burton has cast Johnny Depp, and per the actors usual resourcefulness, Depp has turned Todd into a seething, spitting Hammer horror, more punk than prog. Whereas in <i>Ed Wood,</i> it felt like both collaborators were finally revealing something under the makeup, Todd, with his Sontag shock-stripe, is the peak of their stylized menace. Hes a scream.</p><p>Given the towering stature of the musical, one cant help but wince at errant nicks. Helena Bonham Carter is porcelain and lovely as always, but hardly the brassy presence needed to persuasively draw this monster out of his cage; you dont have to know the classic stage turn by Angela Lansbury to feel somethings slightly out of whack. Sacha Baron Cohen owns his brief comic role as Todds faux-Italian competitor, but where is baddie Alan Rickmans customary fire? Still, Burton does more than just deliver, and even if you wish hed sharpened his instruments a little longer, the shave is bracing.</p><p></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Click here to read our interview with the director of 'Mid-August Lunch'</p><p>Its no secret that many Italian men stay at home with mamma until they get married, or at least until mamma finally kicks them out into the big, bad world. But this low-key Italian charmer, which is more of a touching, humorous short story than a fully fleshed novel, takes that idea to extreme lengths. Writer-director Gianni Di Gregorio (one of the writers on last years Gomorrah, but dont expect any guns here) plays Gianni, a placid Roman in his fifties who lives with his elderly mum Valeria (Valeria De Franciscis), a refined 80 year old who always looks like shes dressed for dinner at the Ritz back in 1963.<br /><br />This loving pair live in a comfortable city-centre apartment, surrounded by good furniture and knickknacks accumulated over many years, but we know they have little cash as the manager of their building comes knocking, wondering when theyre going to pay their service charges. In place of a cheque, Gianni agrees to look after the managers mother for the weekend. However, when the mother, Grazia, turns up, she has another relative, Maria, in tow. Within hours, Gianni has also agreed to take care of Marina, his doctors mother, which means hell be spending the mid-August holiday (ferragosto) in the company of four women with a combined age of around 350.<br /><br />Its a bit of a stretch to call this a comedy, even though it puts a warm grin on your face from beginning to end. The real beauty of the film lies in how Di Gregorio quietly realises the relationships between Gianni and the four women. These ladies might need a bit of looking after, but they still like to talk about boys, eat good food and even, in one case, wander off in the middle of the night for a furtive drink.<br /><br />Underlying this amiable, thoughtful film is an assumption that age should bring with it respect  and however exasperated he gets, Gianni abides by this code completely. Oddly, the film reminded me a little of Curb Your Enthusiasm, partly because Gianni, with his silly domestic horse-trading, comes across as a much kinder incarnation of Larry David and partly because it shares a freewheeling concern for the absurdity of the everyday, such as when Gianni has to buy food from a local fisherman to feed his unexpected guests. But this is very much a real and warm enterprise, not least because Di Gregorio extracts such lovely performances from his elderly cast. A treat.</p><p>Click here to read our interview with the director of 'Mid-August Lunch' <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Grafting crude, borderline-cruel 21st-century humor onto a comedy of manners that pointedly evokes the first decade of the last century is a novel way of getting laughs, so the drug-deranged gay dwarf and profanity-spewing senior citizen in this Frank Oz Britcom have a certain peculiar integrity. The sniveling prat who gets sprayed with the old guys shit, maybe not so much.</p><p>Trashy trappings aside, <i>Death at a Funeral</i> is a pleasant if staid account of a bourgie clan burying one of its own. The funeral party gathers at the home of the deceased, where his feuding adult sons (MacFadyen and Graves), devoted niece (Donovan) and her inadvertently doped fianc (the scene-stealing, frequently naked Alan Tudyk), along with various hangers-onincluding the aforementioned acid casualty (Peter Dinklage) and be-fecesed friend of the family (Andy Nyman)pop the cork on their long-simmering resentments. This makes for pretty thin broth, and most of the films fun is reserved for its final third. But Oz does a decent job of building up to <i>Death</i>s big laughsand even when things go all gooey for the sentimental finale, theres a final gross-out gag pitched to the cheap seats.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Americans take it for granted that, assuming we know four chords (and the truth), we could plausibly become rock stars. The struggling Springsteens and Strokes fanatics in Bahman Ghobadi’s look at Tehran’s termitelike music scene don’t have it as easy; the authorities treat anyone with a Stratocaster like a criminal suspect. If you’re as lucky as the young singer-songwriter duo Negar (Shaghaghi) and Ashkan (Koshanejad) and get a gig in London, you’ll have to jump through a series of bureaucratic hoops to play abroad. (That Ashkan is female only adds to the red-tape pileup.) A fast-talking hustler (Behdad) takes them under his wing, introducing them to fellow “revolutionaries” and helping them buy black-market passports. Meanwhile, the creative suppression continues: “We sing underground,” laments one Jay-Z wanna-be, “[and] the sound won’t go past the floor.” </p><p>Having previously favored the poetic pastoralism of most modern Iranian cinema (see<i> A Time for Drunken Horses</i>), Ghobadi opts for a funky-urban feel here, allowing viewers a glimpse of the city’s regional interpretations of blues, rap, metal and Pitchfork-approved indie rock. The sheer ecstasy of expression in these performances gives the movie a pulse, though the director’s abuse of MTV aesthetics—quick cuts, skewed angles, generic shots of city life—turns what should be lyrical interludes into karaoke background videos. These artists are risking everything by playing Western-influenced music; that Ghobadi cheapens and cheeses up their subversion with Hollywood tricks makes for a seriously bitter irony</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[An RTE-BBC co-production, this peculiar, often beautiful documentary presents the racing year through the big, brown eyes of three horses  Ardalan, Joncol and Cuan Na Grai  at one of Irelands top stables. Filmmaker Liz Mermins approach is a sort of inversion of March of the Penguins-style anthropomorphism: rather than frame animals behaviour as if they were people, she seeks to portray the horses personalities and experiences on their own terms, with secondary attention to the team of humans who attend them. Its an interesting idea that works to a limited extent but is hobbled by the fact that horses are just not that interesting as subjects  and where they are, its impossible to get more than a superficial appreciation of their thought-world. Cuan Na Grai, for instance, seems to have some kind of mood disorder but while jarring, arrhythmic music might complement his enervated movements, it gets nowhere near unpacking them. Call me anthropocentric, but its the people in this film who make the strongest impression, and their words: one contender, were told, ran like a hairy goat.]]></review>

Bahman Ghobadis previous work has been similarly eclectic with mixed results, although his eye for imagery is undeniably arresting.

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Liam Neeson goes from releasing krakens in <i>Clash of the Titans</i>
to wearing medical Crocs in this semisuccessful horror flick, which
casts the towering performer as Eliot Deacon, a soft-spoken mortician
with the ability to talk to the recently deceased. Its never entirely
confirmed if his very particular set of skills is genuine or the
elaborate cover of a serial killer; suffice it to say that when
schoolteacher Anna Taylor (a necrolicious Christina Ricci) crosses his slab,
theres a lot of impassioned hemming and hawing about whether shes
dead or alive.</p><p>Deacon cleverly talks around the facts of her case
with the kind of mock-philosophical misdirection (Only I can see you
as you really are.) befitting the Saw films Jigsaw. Yet this bogeyman
is different: Neeson clearly relishes the role, but he never plays to
the cheap seats by going whole-hog psychotic. The characters
motivations remain tantalizingly opaque from first frame to last.</p><p>Would
that writer-director Wojtowicz-Vosloo brought the same sense of
tightrope-traversing rigor (minus mortis) to the rest of the film.
Ricci is certainly game, baring body and soul in her scenes with
Neeson. But two subplotsone involving Annas bereaved boyfriend, Paul
(Justin Long), the other one of her death-obsessed studentsact as damaging
narrative deadweight. This is one case where theres more life in the
morgue than out.</p>]]></review>

But apparently not—at least according to this tunnel-vision editorial. News footage, Internet clippings and interviews with like-minded pundits are all melded together in order to map out corruption in New Jersey’s public education system, before the whole shebang arrives at a startlingly simple solution: charter schools. Right! Veteran TV anchor Bob Bowdon’s feature debut has all the intricate nuance of an evening newscast; its analysis is heavy on diagnosis but simplistic when it comes to the cure, as well as woefully ignorant of racial and fiscal complications.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Call it <i>Brokeback Talmud</i>not just for its taboo-busting depiction of a gay affair between Orthodox Israelis, but because it adopts Ang Lees slow-burn seriousness almost to a fault. To his credit, first-time director Tabakman displays more explicit sensuality than Lees cowboys, with perhaps the sexiest scenes ever filmed with Hasidic Jews. But thats strictly between repressed butcher Aaron (Shtrauss, resembling a yarmulked Jake Gyllenhaal) and his wanton apprentice, Ezri (Danker); when Aaron gets home to Rivka (Tinkerbell), the mother of his three kids, their bedroom action has all the excitement of navel lint-picking.</p><p>The film strains under a similar perfunctoriness, leaning on a cheerless, Euro-fest mode of long takes and a moody electronic score. But the low-key observational approach does yield payoffs, like when Aaron gets to know Ezris nature through his vaguely erotic sketches of men from yeshiva school. Theres a terrific sequence in which Aarons peers enlist him to rough up a non-Orthodox man dating an Orthodox girl, as an indirect warning that theyre on to his secret. <i>Eyes Wide Open</i> finally delivers a knockout visual: the lovers meeting seemingly alone, only for a passing cars window to reveal a dozen men monitoring them. The dramas moments of inspiration vindicate its desultory proceedings. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>As consumers become hyperaware of—and more immune to—advertising’s effects, the stealth-marketing industry has developed some truly sinister ways to control how we spend our hard-earned wages. That’s the thesis of cowriter-director Derrick Borte’s depressing satire, which tracks the titular clan that demands to be kept up with after moving into a McMansion community. The setup is brilliant, even if it doesn’t play out so cleverly: The Joneses aren’t an actual family, but a sleeper cell of ambitious marketeers hired by a mysterious corporation—the golf nut “dad” (Duchovny) being the most recent recruit. All of the family members are silver-tongued Type A’s: the fake high-schooler daughter (Heard) imploring her peers to buy the latest cosmetics and diet pills; the son (Ben Hollingsworth) hawking tech gadgets and video games; and Mom (Moore) working her housewife ripple-effect integration at the salon.</p><p>The spot-on cast almost holds the movie together, but whatever potential this timely premise has is wasted on reworking the same gag about overconsumption. Once romance gets in the way of business and one of the conniving Joneses suddenly finds their humanity, it’s only a matter of time before everything implodes. More discomforting is that real Audis and Dell computers show up among the fake luxuries, which means the joke’s really on us: Product placement strikes again! </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ordinary-looking, middle-aged Krister (Olle Sarri) wakes on the bathroom floor, spattered with blood. He washes, dresses and goes to work. Hes irritable, out of sorts, yelling at his clients. The world around him is vague but intrusive  the lights too bright, the noise too loud. He goes to the gym, then drives home. The living room looks like a slaughterhouse.<br /><br />Jesper Ganslandts third feature is a work of psychological observation in the most literal sense: all we can do is watch. Theres no commentary, no judgment and precious little insight, so what were left with is a simple, near-real-time portrait of a taciturn, unreadable man trying to deal with the extremity of his existence. Sarri is phenomenal as Krister, an icy, utterly unpredictable blank canvas. Ganslandt directs with tremendous precision, creating a mood of brooding, implacable threat. But his refusal to dig any deeper into his character results in a compelling but finally (and perhaps intentionally) rather shallow portrait of human behaviour.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Give James Ivory a long-lauded novel (<i>A Room with a View, The Bostonians</i>)—or a decent book by a great author (<i>Howards End</i>)—and he can deliver an adaptation attuned to period-piece nuances and intricate social codes. Hand this filmmaker a piece of fiction set in the here and now, however, and Ivory seems lost; it’s as if he needs decades of distance and a canonized voice to bring out his best work. So it’s no surprise that, even with longtime screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala watching his back, the director never finds his groove with Peter Cameron’s tale about an academic (Metwally) who encounters problems while writing a biography of a late literary celebrity. The loved ones won’t consent; after this would-be Boswell treks down to the family compound in Uruguay, he gets caught up in the lives of the author’s wife (Linney), mistress (Gainsbourg) and brother (Hopkins).</p><p>The impeccably photographed landscapes and highbrow talk of the filmmaker’s tony dramas are here. (“You probably just read criticism,” barks Hopkins, the Ivory equivalent of an “Oh, snap!”) But the emotional pull of his classic screen translations is completely MIA, and not even Linney and Hopkins engaging in a thespian-off livens things up. Finality, schminality; it’s like being stuck in a remote way station, awaiting better things.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Aiming to both approximate and steadily subvert ’70s backslapping guys’ films like John Cassavetes’s <i>Husbands,</i> director Bette Gordon’s coming-out tale casts rugged-mug character actor Jamey Sheridan as Harry, a poker-faced electrician who’s forced to reckon with his past. After an old Navy buddy (Buscemi) begs for atonement from his death bed, Harry reaches out to other bygone pals, hoping to make sense of an act of homophobic violence perpetrated more than 30 years ago. Who cast the first stone at their gay comrade? And who, pray tell, <i>actually</i> dropped the soap? </p><p>Gordon (<i>Variety</i>) and screenwriter Nicholas Proferes couch their gender studies in forced aggression and slangy guy talk: being male means constantly calling each other “pussies,” self-medicating with saloon shots and punctuating conversations with punches to the face. “We became men together,” one character says. “It must count for something.” Unfortunately, Gordon asks that notion to count for everything without adding much to the conversation. Harry’s haunted by his own identity crisis, but that breakdown translates into nothing but smeary, slo-mo flashbacks. Forget about insight into the macho mind-set; such shorthand tricks are only there to manufacture a false sense of suspense—and help avoid the real drama of what happens after the truth comes out.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Although based on the real-life tale of nine underage underdogs from Monterrey, Mexico who swept the 1957 Little League World Series, this Cinderella sports story rings false from first pitch to last. Boys can’t just be boys here—they need to be pint-size saints, keeping the faith and crusading against racism. With God fully on <i>our</i> side—the Christian sermonizing leans heavily on vague, theologically dubious suggestions of divine baseball providence—there’s not even a swing-and-a-miss threat to the preordained outcome.</p><p> Recently fired MLB janitor Cesar (Collins) retreats south of the border to booze, scowl and don a wife-beater, until a kid named Angel (!) strong-arms him into coaching the town’s fledgling ball team. Along with the local priest (Marin), Cesar shepherds them to the promised lands—otherwise known as Texas and Kentucky—and then to the championship, where the film belabors its namesake. Director William Dear, apparent king of baseball devotionals (<i>Angels in the Outfield, The Sandlot 3</i>), betrays no understanding or respect for how the game is actually played: He harps on home-run money shots in which balls limply fly as if they were being controlled by string, remote control or the ghost of Ed Wood. <i>The Perfect Game</i> courts its target demos like a leg-humping hound, but sports fans, believers, Latinos and even young wanna-be Willie Mayses can find fellowship elsewhere.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Its a no-brainer why this crowd-pleasing romantic thriller, the latest example of suicide-bomber cinema, was nominated for seven Israeli Academy Awards. It allows audiences to congratulate themselves for acknowledging deep-seated complexities without the burden of actually grappling with them. </p><p>Driven to Tel Aviv and armed with a vest full of dynamite, Tarek (Jabarin), a young Palestinian Arab has explicit orders to martyr himself in the Carmel Market. But when the bustling Saturday morning arrives, his trigger button malfunctions. His antsy handlers can remotely spark him up via cell phone, but Tarek convinces them to hold off while he gets one of his enemiesa kindly old electrician named Katz (Vishinsky)to unwittingly repair his detonator. Running the kiosk across the street is Keren (Yalon), an Orthodox-raised beauty who is ostracized for her dyed hair and tight clothing. Suddenly, theres a love connection, while the clock silently ticks down. Oh, the tragic irony of it all.</p><p>Too on-the-nose to resonate past the end credits, this slickly produced film still deserves praise for being progressive-minded, as Tarek isnt a hateful man but a product of his circumstances who is only trying to help his family. Its frustrating to see such a humane movie suffer from oversimplification.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A clever satire on Londons art scene? What a treat. But no  what we get with this slick, shallow and flesh-adoring adaptation of Danny Moynihans NYC-set novel, transposed to London, is a limp series of caricatures, hysterical scenes and an overloaded plot that suggest its makers cared more about packing the frame with names than getting the characters and comedy just right. And what names: Danny Huston, Gillian Anderson, Heather Graham, Alan Cumming, Christopher Lee, Amanda Seyfried, Stellan Skarsgrd, Jaime Winstone and Simon McBurney all appear. Its a giggle at times. Huston is louche as a Jay Jopling-like art dealer trying to get his hands on a Mondrian; Anderson amuses as a scene-obsessed collector; and Cumming is shrill as a wannabe curator-manager rejected by a self-obsessed video artist (Winstone) once she finds success. But well-connected, first-time feature director Duncan Ward (his wife is a top curator) throws too much mud too fondly for any to stick. Art world aficionados will have a jolly time identifying the characters and tut-tutting. Others will just tut-tut.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Proving that a comedy’s performers are sometimes more important than its jokes, this remake of Frank Oz’s dreary 2007 British farce of the same name livens up the proceedings by subbing in a comic African-American all-star cast. As before, the setting is a deceased family patriarch’s services, which are spearheaded by the dutiful oldest son (Rock) and his hotshot-author younger brother (Lawrence); all manner of romantic, sibling-rivalry and cross-generational wackiness ensues, mostly of the strained <i>Three’s Company</i> variety.</p><p>Nude, hallucinogen-fueled jaunts on rooftops, revelations about same-sex relationships—with a little person, no less—and individuals covered in feces are all executed with verve by the typically misanthropic Neil LaBute. It’s his formidable cast (which also includes Luke Wilson, Peter Dinklage, James Marsden and Danny Glover) that really keep things moving, though their ability to generate postmortem yuks by brute comedic force never quite compensates for the middling slapstick nature of the high jinks and an over-reliance on easy poop and gay-panic gags. Still, this Death laps the original, laugh-wise, and is LaBute’s second-funniest film to date, trailing only his unintentionally amusing, WTF cover-version of <i>The Wicker Man.</i></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>James Mason has a monkey on his back. A teacher who suffers from debilitating pain due to inflamed arteries, Masons Ed Avery is prescribed the latest miracle drugcortisoneto combat the attacks. The longer Avery pops his pills, the more he starts to exhibit uncharacteristic behavior: taking his spouse (Rush) on impulsive spending sprees, playing football in the house with his son. The sudden fits of aggression, however, are what worry Averys wife and his colleague (Matthau)that, and the Objectivist rants he unleashes during a parent-teacher evening. (Childhood is a congenital disease, and the purpose of education is to cure it.)</p><p>But the cortisone is just the key that opens the cage. The real Kong-size simian is the ideal of 50s masculinity, in which the modern family man is the dictator of all he surveys. Once this sitcom father gone mad is inspired by the story of Abraham and his delusions of grandeur reach a fever pitch, filmgoers are treated to the greatest moment of Eisenhower-era male hysteria: the sight of James Mason bellowing <i>God was wrong!</i></p><p>Nicholas Rays adaptation of a <i>New Yorker</i> article about one mans descent into prescription-drug hell nearly derailed his Hollywood career. But if you need proof of Godards assertion that the cinema <i>is </i>Nicholas Ray, its all here, in every claustrophobic close-up and looming low-angle shot. The suits wanted a torn-from-the-headlines melodrama; what they got was the director at his expressionistic best, subverting the suburban fantasy and leaving nothing but tattered gray flannel and scorched earth in his wake. <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>One is tempted to throw away any semblance of persuasion and simply <i>demand</i> that you go see this movie. Without <i>His Girl Friday</i>, there is no sexy, Tarantino-esque banter (maybe no banter, period; speed limits are flagrantly violated). On a more personal note, this is a movie that makes journalism seem like the most exciting profession in the world: a job that involves daily flirtations, card playing, smoking, phoning it in (both figuratively and literally) and the strong possibility of hooking up with either Svengali editor Cary Grant or ace reporter and former doll-faced hick Rosalind Russell.</p><p>Never were two wits so perfectly entwined, and lets tip a fedora to screenwriter Charles Lederers sparkling bons mots, adapted from the 1928 stage play <i>The Front Page.</i> But the real genius here is director Howard Hawks, who, with the casual insouciance he became known for, liked the way cocky Hildy Johnson sounded when the part came out of his female secretarys mouthso he made the role for a woman. We have to be careful not to ascribe any further politics to the man. But out of such decisions, careers have been born. Its a film that makes you want to sharpen your barbs and sling sass with the adults.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p><i>Killing Kasztner</i> is a case when a films basic material may
be too intractable and thorny to make a satisfying feature-length
documentary. The subject is Rezso (a.k.a. Rudolf) Kasztner, a Hungarian
Jewish lawyer who at the beginning of the Nazi occupation of Budapest
managed to arrange negotiations with Adolf Eichmannsaving nearly 1,700
Jews by paying by the head. This was either heroism or an unspeakable
act of collaborationKasztners detractors suggest that he failed to
warn the Jews he left behindand director Gaylen Ross lays out the matters lasting
political implications in Israel, where Kasztner settled after the war
and where his name is still regarded mostly with suspicion. He was
assassinated in 1957 by a right-wing extremist group.</p><p>Delving into everything from Israeli government documents to Kasztners representation in Holocaust museums, <i>Killing Kasztner</i>
is pitched at wildly varied levels of detail, and it somehow plays as
simultaneously thorough and diffuse. Its clear Rosss sympathies lie
with Kasztners daughter and her children, who have been forced into
defending a man the film argues was essentially the Jewish Schindler.
Rosss biggest coup is to arrange a meeting between Kasztners family
and his convicted assassin, who implies from his first scene that he
wont be a completely reliable witness. The alternation of sentiment
and dry testimony results in a frustrating and scattered film, but its
hard to imagine how <i>Killing Kasztner</i> could have been anything else.</p>]]></review>
