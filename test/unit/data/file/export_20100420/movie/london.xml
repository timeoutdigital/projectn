      <review><![CDATA[A subversive and psychologically rigorous take on RL Stevensons tale of severed souls, Dr Jekyll combines gothic horror, aristocratic romance and madcap Freudian psychodrama into a dizzying, exhilirating brew.<br />Fredric Marchs Jekyll exists in a state of unhappy Victorian reppression, unable to lay a finger on his bride-to-be until their wedding night and sorely tempted by Miriam Hopkins buxom harlot Champagne Ivy. Drinking his serum allows him to throw off the shackles of polite society, to get in touch with the unrestrained, wilfully brutish animal within.<br />But Mamoulians 1931 film is no voyeuristic fantasy: through a strikingly modern combination of subjective camerawork (by Karl Struss) and still-astounding visual effects, he makes it clear that Jekyll is no fiction: he is all of us, all the time. When, in the final scene, a police sergeant turns to the audience with an accusatory finger and a cry of thats the man!, itll be a stalwart soul who doesnt flinch back in his cinema seat.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Gillo Pontecorvos stirring anatomy of an urban uprising  the violent nationalist revolt in Algiers in 1956 and 1957  feels strikingly relevant today. It shows the real consequences of defying popular will with institutional aggression and military force, and of course there are those chilling scenes in which Algerian women, dressed as Europeans, plant four simultaneous bombs in busy public spaces The film arose directly out of the liberation movement it depicts: post-independence in 1962, former rebel Saadi Yacef was released from jail and, with the support of the new government, he invited the Italian filmmaker to dramatise his memoirs. The results are so fine  so modern  that I cant think of a better film born of a political struggle, or at least one that moulds political commentary with drama so effectively. The tone is mournful, the approach journalistic and the aesthetic direct as Pontecorvo reconstructs events on a grand scale on location in Algiers while never losing the intimacy of an Algerian woman quietly crying or a French couple walking past a checkpoint with the words Its nothing we need to worry about. Superb and unrivalled.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Some films dont age well, and no doubt David Lean and Noel Cowards story of two good married people, Laura (Celia Johnson) and Alec (Trevor Howard), who accidentally fall into the trap of infidelity but largely manage to handle themselves with straight-backed propriety, had more of an emotional effect in the social climate of post-war Britain. As it appears now, Lean and Coward only scrape the surface of their subject, as if merely to broach the issue of unfaithfulness in the happy suburban home was enough to have most audiences convinced. The films handling of physical attraction as Laura and Alec meet accidentally at a railway station and proceed to spend each Thursday afternoon together is a cop-out  a touch on the shoulder here, a snatched kiss there  and the wrench of forbidden and impossible love suggested so pointedly by the Rachmaninov music and by Leans imagery (such as Johnson deliberating whether to throw herself onto the railway tracks) is not matched by either the performances or the drama which are jarringly cold (bar some pleasing suave charm from Howard). For a non-hysterical approach, hunt down the DVD of Rohmers Love in the Afternoon instead.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Howard Hawkss late-period comic essay on the economic advantages of an ample bosom is not one of his best, though it just about works as a naughty Technicolor bellwether to these Sex and the City-fixated times. Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell play a pair of chesty chisellers aboard a cruise ship bound for Paris, forced to work their faux-ditsy charms amid a chorus of male admirers. While theres enough laboured screwball and gauche innuendo to raise the odd titter, its the kitsch background details that generate much of the fun: just try not to smirk at the flesh-toned underwear of the backing singers for Russells rendition of Aint There Anyone Here for Love?. Still, if camp comedy capering (dont call it a social satire!) isnt your thing, its worth the ticket to see Monroes iconic and flawlessly choreographed performance of Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend: a perfect four minutes of film.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of the monumental achievements in narrative filmmaking, Sergio Leones grandiose 1966 western epic is nothing less than a masterclass in movie storytelling, a dynamic testament to the sheer, invigorating uniqueness of cinema.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are their usual taciturn selves as rival gunslingers pursuing a cache of lost gold. So its left to Eli Wallachs Tuco to steal the show, the archetypal pitiable, self-deluded villain, the rotten heart of Leones colossal canvas.<br />Its hard to name another film with so many iconic, indelible sequences: Tuco following a trail of half-smoked cigars; the unmanned stagecoach thundering through the desert; the operatic Mexican standoff in the graveyard, as Ennio Morricones peerless score mounts over five nailbiting, wordless minutes. But what impresses most is the intimacy of Leones vision, sketching a vast array of ruthless characters with broad but subtle visual strokes, never losing sight of the humanity amidst the carnage.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This unheralded 40s melodrama is the lead title in the Lean centenary season at BFI Southbank, which adds to the argument that the emotional precision and sharp technical dexterity of Leans earlier, more modest offerings represent a more lasting legacy than his later spectaculars. An enterprising criss-cross time structure shapes Ann Todd and Trevor Howards turbulent relationship, as their romance comes back to haunt them after World War II since shes settled for a staid but secure marriage to banker Claude Rains. <br />Its adapted from a 1913 HG Wells novel, but the storytelling looks decidedly modern, and Leans direction works the material for all its expressive worth, even if Todds glacial screen persona and an opaquely written central role hardly bring out the best in each other. Rains steals the show, his clipped exterior masking unexpectedly touching feelings for his errant spouse. An illuminating reissue.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[I dont want any romantic hassles this week, says tycoon Edward (Richard Gere) as he waves his wad at hooker Vivian (Julia Roberts). Big mistake, as Vivian might say. Romance blossoms as the pair spend the week in LA; she shopping and warming the bed for him; he furrowing his brow over a deal. This re-release makes no bones about its old-school set-up, but this damsel in distress is a feisty entrepreneur ready to rescue her knight in shining armour right back. Sharp dialogue and great chemistry help make it a slick comedy that still stands up. Elements are dated: the soundtrack is full of karaoke classics and the wardrobe screams late 80s. Greed is good, too: money solves most of Vivians problems and even the romantic conclusion is a result of business-like negotiation. But this is a thoroughly enjoyable, character-driven romance that puts most current-day chick flicks  including Garry Marshalls Valentines Day  to shame.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Where would we be without Psycho? Fifty years on and Hitchs delicious cod-Freudian nightmare about a platinum-blonde embezzler (Janet Leigh) who neglected to consult a guide before selecting her motel still has much to answer for. It blazed a bloody trail for the much-loved slasher cycle, but it also assured us that a B-movie could be A-grade in quality and innovation. It dared to suggest that your star didnt need to surface from an ordeal smelling of roses (or, indeed, at all). It combined a knife, a scream, a melon, some chocolate sauce, Bernard Herrmanns greatest score and more than 70 edits to push the envelope of screen violence. It lent The Simpsons some of its best gags: (Seymour Skinner: Oh theres Mother now, watching me. Whats that, Mother? That sailor suit doesnt fit any more!). It offers perfect case studies of suspense, paranoia and montage for lazy film-studies tutors. And, of course, it was the first movie to show a toilet flushing, so we might also credit it with spawning the entire gross-out genre. Psycho: we salute you.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Spruced up in preparation for a fortieth- anniversary DVD release, Lionel Jeffriess 1970 adaptation of Edith Nesbits homely childrens novel still basks in a warm, rosy glow of universal nicety. Set in the early 1900s, the story  about three well-bred kids (Jenny Agutter, Gary F Warren and the excellent Sally Thomsett) having to leave their plush London home when Father is jailed for selling state secrets  is a celebration of old-fashioned British fortitude set in an environment of steam engines, buttercups, top hats and smocks. They then spend their days by the railway, waving at passengers, preventing disasters and hanging out with Bernard Cribbinss waggish station master. Putting aside its fusty look and feel, Jeffriess film remains an enjoyable evocation of the time. Of course, whether todays kids get it is open to debate.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The directors own favourite of his 54 movies, Yasujiro Ozus 1953 film Tokyo Story surveys the Japanese family in the American-influenced post-war reconstruction period. The story  never the Japanese masters greatest interest  is a simple one. It concerns the visits paid to their children in Osaka and Tokyo by an elderly couple (Tomi, 68, and Shukishi, 70) from the southern seaside town of Onomichi, a quiet fishing port and traditional centre of Buddhist devotion, which was then a day and a nights train journey from the high-rises, smoking factories and modernity of Japans frenetic capital.<br />Often topping lists of the best films of all time, and a great influence on many great directors of the last half century, not least for its purity of expression, this remains one of the most approachable and moving of all cinemas masterpieces. Furthermore, Ozus style  with its so-called pillow shots (introductory shots of yet-unhabited rooms), low, static camera position, unhurried pacing and elaborately composed frames  has come to look, in an age of refreshed minimalism, more and more modern. Also, his main interest  how ordinary human emotions are expressed in the context of the changing modern family  has become ever more fundamental, relevant and richly rewarding.<br />Ozus is a cinema of cumulative impact. The films early scenes delve into the cluster of families around Tomi and Shukishi  busy doctor Koichi; no-nonsense hair-salon owner Shige; sweet widowed daughter-in-law Noriko  observing their variously neglectful or dutiful relations with little or no introduction. Shukishi goes on a sake binge with old pals and they discuss their estrangement from, and disappointment with, their offspring. You could say that learning to deal with disappointment is the philosophical, even religious, heart of Tokyo Story. And the way Ozu builds up emotional empathy for a sense of disappointment in its various characters is where his mastery lies.<br />Not that the film is without irony, lightheartedness or downright comedy  No Weddings and a Funeral, anybody? Ozu had fun  and an estimated 43 bottles of sake  collaborating with scriptwriter Kogo Noda on Tokyo Story, and his films are as full of spontaneous insights and significant personal detail as those of Ozu-admired Hollywood comedians Ernst Lubitsch or Leo McCarey. But, like Hitchcock, Ozu planned and storyboarded everything with minute precision; no cutaway to a stone lantern or line of washing is accidental and the slow arc of his film must be attentively imbibed for the films overwhelming force to be truly felt.<br />None of this would be true, of course, were it not for the strength of the performances, and Tokyo Story is remarkable for the balance and richness of the ensemble playing by such Ozu regulars as Chishu Ryu (as Shukishi) and, especially, the marvellous, eminently graceful Setsuko Hara whose line, Everyone has to look after their own life first, is all the more shocking coming as it does from one of the most radiantly selfless characters in the history of cinema.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In the opening credits of this 1948 old-Hollywood classic, the legendary German directors name is Americanised as Max Opuls. Somehow its appropriate, because from its painstakingly designed interiors to its sweeping, fluid camerawork, from its overblown score to its devastating central performances, Letter From an Unknown Woman is suffused with opulence. But this is no Sternbergian exercise in glamour: in telling of young Viennese dreamer Lisa (Joan Fontaine) and her desire for an unattainable man (Louis Jourdan) and the high-style world he inhabits, Ophls comes down on the side of the outsider, those of us with our noses pressed up against the glass. So for all its florid melodramatic trappings, this grand, heartbreaking masterpiece resonates with sad, simple truths: just because one can appreciate beauty, that does not make one beautiful, and just because one loves does not mean one is loved.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>There are plenty of reasons why you might dislike Im Not There, Todd Haynes crazy jigsaw of a sort-of biography of Bob Dylan that breaks all the rules without writing any new ones. If youre a Dylan nut, you might object to the loose telling of the facts  What? Youre telling me that Suze Rotolo and Sara Lownds were the same person and that Dylan fathered two daughters with her? That kind of thing. Alternatively, if you know next to zilch about Dylan, you might find yourself all at sea amid Haynes torrent of wink-wink references and playful, fold-in, fold-out approach to events in the artists life. And, finally, if youre one of those who cant stand Dylans songs or hear anything in them beyond an excoriating whine, well, sorry, but you may find yourself reaching to employ your popcorn as earplugs: the film is packed with his music, performed by the man himself and a clever line-up of cover artists, from Sonic Youth to Cat Power to Calexico.</p><p>The recipe is famous. Six actors. Seven Dylans  none of them called Dylan. Colour. Black-and-white. Backwards and forwards. Forwards and backwards. Selective memory. Abstract concepts of character. The deconstruction of images and speeches. Marcus Carl Franklin, a 13-year-old African-American actor, plays the spirit of a teenage Dylan meshed with his hero Woody Guthries vision of the highways and byways of the depressed 1930s nation. Heath Ledger is a late 60s film star who is wrestling with a failing marriage to a celebrated painter (played by Charlotte Gainsbourg). Christian Bale is two Dylans: first Jack, a protest singer in early 60s Greenwich Village, then in the late 70s John, an evangelical preacher in the dreary suburbs. Richard Gere is a reclusive Bob, framed in the territory of Peckinpahs Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid and playing Billy as a disguised, wandering survivor of Garretts blood-lust. Then theres Cate Blanchett, all cheekbones and mercurial, as Pennebakers black-suited Dylan and who exists in a world where verit meets Richard Lester meets Fellini. And, lastly, theres Ben Whishaw who evokes Dylans love of Rimbaud and hatred of questioning with his back to the wall in an interrogation set-up.</p><p>Whatever your prejudices, if youre sick of films that treat the lives of artists  musicians, especially  in the same, predictable fashion, then you should thank the high heavens for Im Not There. Too often, we watch and groan as artistic inspiration is presented as a corny eureka moment (I still havent forgotten the sight of paint dripping to the floor of Jacksons lavatory in Pollock) and domesticity is offered as a barrier to expression and later as a refuge from the fallout of that expression. Too often, too, a film claims to offer the last word on a life. Haynes is pretending to offer no such thing. His approach is honest: its the reflection of a life through the mirror of experimental film. Its an acceptance that contradictions and interpretations and even mistakes are more acceptable than a biography preached as if from a pulpit.This is a typical blurring of form from a director who has already rethought the lives of Karen Carpenter and David Bowie and who looked afresh at the work of Douglas Sirk in Far From Heaven. ts not a perfect experiment. At several points, it loses its strange rhythm, only to be rescued by the music itself, which is always well chosen and placed. At other times, Haynes is too much in debt to his sources, such as Pennebakers films, or he fixates for too long on a single thought, such as that which sees Gere wandering through a carnivalesque landscape in the late nineteenth century. But the films best ideas  such as Franklins Woody strumming in the lounge of his proud, white adopted family or Ledgers Robbie wandering out of a Nicholas Ray-style film-within-a-film to fall in love with Charlotte Gainsbourg and later to reject her  are smart, playful and ensure that as a fractured, highly personal biography, Im Not There is full of intriguing arguments, movements and performances.<br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[One of the more curious aspects of recent Hollywood cinema has been a desire to make the conceptually outlandish psychologically mundane. Yeah, Christopher Nolan invites us to think, when you put it like that, I can see why a guy might dress up as a bat and fight crime. Peter Jackson doesnt just want us to marvel at or pity a 20ft ape, he wants to unpack its abandonment issues. And recently, Wes Anderson granted a talking animal enough pop-psych introspection to acknowledge, I have this thing where I need everyone to think Im this quote-unquote Fantastic Mr Fox.<br />Spike Jonzes adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are, Maurice Sendaks beloved story about Max, a naughty boy in a wolf suit who sails away to an exotic jungle and meets giant beasties who make him their king, takes this tendency even further. In expanding the couple of dozen pages of Sendaks picture-book to feature length, Jonze and his co-writer, Dave Eggers, approach atavistic fantasy with jarring formal and psychological realism. The forest, desert and mountain locations are real, as are the creature costumes (CGI facial expressions aside); beautifully photographed, often in handheld shots and magic-hour light, these landscapes and figures have a solidity, weight and detail that feels uncanny in an age of virtual imagining.<br />Lumbering around their island with satisfying heft, these weird beasts  hybrids of human, animal and mythical parts that faithfully realise Sendaks drawings  have an oddly quotidian social dynamic and comically normal names: insecure Judith and Alexander (voiced by Catherine OHara and Paul Dano), more assured Ira and Douglas (Forest Whitaker and Chris Cooper), gruff but vulnerable Carol (James Gandolfini). Feeling less like a pack of monsters than a group of long-arrested adolescents left to their own devices, they entertain crushes, grudges and neuroses, pile gleefully into group projects, sustain minor injuries and go off in sulks, yearning for structure and security all the while. Think Lord of the Flies on Fraggle Rock. Finding himself in loco parentis, Max must take emotional responsibility, and one of the films pleasures is young Max Recordss deft and unaffected portrayal of this shift. <br />Its hard to guess whether many children will enjoy the movie. Ponderous at times, it could probably be 15 minutes shorter and lacks a real sense of mortal danger. Theres also sometimes an over-determined feel to the correspondences between the island adventure and Maxs real life with his mother (Catherine Keener) and sister, as laid out in the opening scenes. But Where the Wild Things Are stands out for its unusually potent evocation of the timbre of childhood imagining, with its combination of the outr and the banal, grand schemes jumbled up with delicate feelings and the urge to smash things up.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This intriguing and revelatory blend of human drama and art-history detective work argues that Rembrandt peppered the canvas of his masterpiece The Night Watch with a cleverly coded attack on the Amsterdam bigwigs whose egos he was commissioned to flatter. Deftly combining character study and cultural documentary, it marks Peter Greenaways return to the cinema after years of museum installations and multimedia work. Hes been guilty of patience-testing pretension in the past, but this is impressively focused and accessible, shaped around a truly expressive balls-out performance from Martin Freeman as Rembrandt. Whats surprising (in the context of Greenaways often chilly past oeuvre) is the films genuine compassion for the sufferings of wives, maids and vulnerable orphans, adding an emotive underpinning to its sharp observations on the purpose of art and the nature of representation. Its not just Greenaways best film in years, but one of his best films, period.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The centrepiece of BFI Southbanks Mikio Naruse season (see Other Cinema), this brilliant melodrama is a contender for reissue of the year. Its a film which encapsulates the strengths of this masterly Japanese director whose work has barely been seen here. Hes known as a great director of actresses, and his signature performer Hideko Takamine is outstanding as a middle-aged hostess struggling to maintain her self-respect in the sleazy whisky-lubricated environs of Ginzas bar circuit, as she wrestles with the dilemma that the admirers who could offer her financial security demand her reputation in exchange. Battling to support her family and keep her own long-suppressed emotions in check, each night that she climbs the stairs to smile at the clientele is a painful reminder of her limited options. Fascinating as social study, painstakingly assured as storytelling, this compares with Sirks All That Heaven Allows and Fassbinders Fear Eats the Soul as a heartbreaking portrait of a defiant woman outflanked by the repressive mores around her. A new classic.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Disney has pulled off a bit of a doozy with this amusing parody of its own oeuvre. Ostensibly a freewheeling blend of the Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty fairytales, Enchanted begins in conventional, animated Disney territory where pretty Giselle is being courted by Edward, her Prince Charming. His witchy mother, however, has an evil scheme on the boil and banishes Giselle to twenty-first century New York City. <br />At this juncture, the film flits from animation to live action just as Giselle (now Amy Adams), dressed to the nines in a flowing ball gown, emerges from a manhole into a world of bustling humanity. Her first real-world encounter is with divorce lawyer Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey), who, despite sensing correctly that shes well away with the fairies, eventually relents to her request for shelter and  lo and behold!  begins <br />to fall for the scatty lass. When Edward eventually appears (in the guise of James Marsden), Giselle is left facing a typically predictable rom-com dilemma.</p><p>At first glance, Kevin Limas contemporary urban fantasy looks hideously twee. Its only when the story hits the streets of NYC and Adams starts hamming it up (much like Julie Hagerty did in Airplane) that we start seeing the fruits of a grand Mickey-take. Giselle is clearly on another planet; she swans around singing inane songs and delivering amusingly mundane fantasy lingo in a shrill voice. Had Adams (no relation) not hammed-up her performance to such a degree and, more pertinently, had the film taken itself seriously, one might otherwise have felt compelled to torch the screen. Instead, Enchanted is one of the better family films of this year.<br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Based on Antonio Pennacchis bestselling novel, Il Fasciocomunista and written by Italys premier screenwriting duo, Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli, this is as lively, witty, funny and intelligent a meditation on Italys Fascist inheritance as were likely to get. <br />Coursing through the 60s, it follows the mirrored experiences of two politically-divided brothers from working-class Latina (the Mussolini-built town outside Rome used by Paolo Sorrentino as the symbolic locus for The Family Friend): awkward, interrogative Accio and his older Casanova-skilled brother Manrico. As mothers favourite, Manrico gets ever deeper involved with the revolutionary left, while the sharp-tongued contrarian Accio, expelled from his seminary, falls under the influence of dogmatic father-figure, Mario and his band of thuggish Fascist aristocrats, occasioning fraternal punch-ups on the picket lines and stretching the battling brothers mutual loyalty to the breaking point.<br /><br />Lacking the length and depth of Petraglia and Rullis magnum opus The Best of Youth, Luchettis film nevertheless covers much the same ground in entertaining, serio-comic fashion. A great deal of the films lightness and humour comes from the acting, not least the delightful, spiky and engaging performances of Vittorio Emanuele Propizio and Elio Germano as the adolescent and mature Accio. <br />Its a fundamentally satiric, domestic vision of a destructive civil war that serves a gentle critique of the more po-faced heavy examinations of Italys past (including the writers own) which manages to evoke, but never trivialise, the mad, internecine conflicts of recent Italian political history. Sprightly-directed, it is only slightly spoilt by an unnecessarily grand and overly sentimental ending.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Adapted from the best-selling novel by Afghan-born American writer Khaled Hosseini, this accessible, deftly-directed and moving tale of childhood regret and adult atonement courses through three decades of war-torn Afghan history in personal terms. In 1978, preceding the Soviet invasion, privileged seven-year-old Kabul boy Amir (Zekeria Ebrahmi) witnesses the rape of his friend and fellow kite-flyer, lower-class Hazara servant Hassan (the expressive and contained Ahmad Khan Mahmidzada) by the malevolent Assef. Confused and angered by his own powerlessness, guilt, and shame, Amir frames his erstwhile companion for theft and is further admonished by the morally pure, loyal and self-abnegating behaviour of his victim, something that troubles the aspirant-writer Amir through his 20-odd years of exile in the US. In the present, a visit to Pakistan to see his dead fathers dying friend, offers news of Hassans fate, and prompts the older, now-married Amir (Khalid Abdalla) to a dangerous visit to his now Taliban-controlled home.</p><p>Notwithstanding the inevitable tendency of individual stories set against momentous national upheavals to conflate and simplify historical events, Marc Finding Neverland Forsters film achieves minor miracles within the bounds of his broadly conventional narrative. His sober approach allows a surprising level of complexity in his films wider interest in themes of guilt, displacement, honour and conflicting traditions, while his sensitivity to the emotional responses of his characters  both adult and child  is never overwhelmed nor upstaged by his incorporation of challenging dramatic scenes (such as a startlingly brutal stoning of an adulterous couple in a Kabul stadium). Likewise, the films belief in the power of redemption and its subtle assertion of the need for moral courage in personal (or political) conflict, is never allowed to get in the way of its boldly told, intelligent, informed and affecting story.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>This traditionally animated film from the director of Kirikou and the Sorceress breathes new life into a dying art. Trouble is, it remains to be seen how most kids will take to such a languorously paced film. </p><p>The Princes Quest is a wondrous, if overly simplified, spin on the Arabian Nights series of Middle Eastern stories that centres on two competitive boys from different backgrounds: Azur is the blonde, blue-eyed son of a nobleman, while olive-skinned Asmar is of Arabian descent and the son of Azurs nanny, Jenane. She reads them stories about the incarcerated Djinn fairy and they become so besotted with the tale that, years later, they compete in a quest to rescue the legendary pixie. </p><p>But which lad will get there first? Michel Ocelots enchanting parable is admirable in the way it tackles the concepts of prejudice, respect and tolerance, but its the vivid quality of the inspired, enchanced silhouette animation that leaves the most lasting impression. <br />Splendid stuff.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[With a setup familiar from Lost in Translation, a plot similar to White Noise and a monster recognisable from Ringu, J-horror remake Shutteris little more than a mish-mash of random and increasingly blatant references disguised as a movie. Ben (Joshua Jackson) is a photographer returning to his Tokyo studio with new bride Jane (Rachael Taylor) in tow. <br />But a series of mysterious ghostly blurs on Janes holiday snaps lead her to investigate the phenomenon of spirit photography, by which images of the dead can be caught on film. Soon she and her increasingly shifty-looking hubby are inextricably entangled in a web of lies, flies and herky-jerky long haired ghost-women.<br />Despite one or two effective scares and an unnerving strobelit sequence, Shutteris instantly forgettable stuff, never even attempting to transcend its low rent multiplex status. Throwing in daft plot twists every few minutes for its undemanding teen audience, the film ticks along harmlessly enough without ever managing to leave a lasting impression.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Click here to read an interview with director Bigelow<br />Best known for 1991s Point Break, Kathryn Bigelow is back in the frame with one of the better films about the US Army in Iraq  and one of the few not to send American audiences running for the hills. Written and co-produced by war reporter Mark Boal (who worked on Paul Haggiss In the Valley of Elah), Bigelows film combines an expert management of tension with a sensitive and journalistic attention to detail: she has one eye on the truth and the other on the multiplex, and, if you can forgive her the odd sentimental or sensational flourish, this makes for an unusual mix of the thrilling and the sobering.<br />The films focus is a bomb disposal squad in Baghdad in 2004 and the 38-day rotation of Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner, pictured), an expert in defusing devices and a mouthy renegade whom you could view as either hot shit, as one superior calls him, or deserving of a sock in the jaw, as one of his peers prefers. Bigelow builds suspense and empathy by sticking closely to this small band through several episodes  including one superbly executed desert gunfight  and allowing us to experience events as they unfold for the soldiers. <br />The photography from United 93 DoP and regular Ken Loach collaborator Barry Ackroyd lends a frenetic immediacy to proceedings, while the use of Amman as Baghdad lends context and reality to a claustrophobic story. Bigelow is more interested in psychology than politics, but she shows just enough awareness of how the behaviour of soliders can fuel retaliation and even includes one direct suggestion that the US Army can and does choose to disregard the welfare of civilians. Most encouragingly, the film offers a fine distinction between heroism and heroics.<br />Click here to read an interview with director Bigelow<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The incessant yowl of bawling babies is not something youd expect to hear in your average prison movie. But then, Pablo Traperos militantly unsentimental chronicle of life in the maternity wing of an Argentinian womens prison is no Shawshank Redemption. Martina Gusman delivers a magnificently understated turn as Julia, locked up on the back of a bizarre murder rap (we never discover the extent of her guilt) and carrying the child of her dead lover. She is our guide on the inside, initially petrified at the prospect of bringing up her child in such grimy and violent surroundings but soon learning to work the intensely restrictive system to her advantage.<br /><br />Part meticulous character study, part hyperrealist drama, Traperos film is as interested in documenting how such an institution functions on a day-to-day basis as he is in presenting the joys and pains of female cohabitation in such a confined space. His film also asks us to question whether its right that the young innocents should suffer the same punishment as their errant mothers. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Id rather be a good nobody than an evil somebody is the mantra for this undistinguished animated Frankenstein comedy spin-off. Igor is one of many identical-looking hunchbacks who aid the kingdom of Malarias evil scientists with their wicked inventions. Igor (voiced by John Cusack) has a face like Peter Lorre and a demeanour far removed from his master, Dr Glickenstein (John Cleese). Hes also more intelligent than his fellow hunchbacks. <br />So, when Glickenstein accidentally expires, Igor sets out to prove his worth by inventing the most monstrous of all monsters in Eva. However, Eva turns out to be more caring and thoughtful than destructive, and eventually persuades Igor that more comes out of being good than being bad. The animation here is vaguely Tim Burton-esque with a nod to Ralph Steadman in some of the outlandish characters, especially that of Eddie Izzards key villain, Dr Schadenfreude. But theres not much form to the plot which develops in fits and starts. Nevertheless, those kids that werent confused appeared to enjoy it, so there you go.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The tiny changes in human behaviour that occur when faced with loss is a theme that Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda has consistently explored in his films. 1998s After Life speculated on how people come to terms with the loss of their own lives, 2004s Nobody Knows offered a group of children forced to muddle through adolescence without parents and this extraordinarily tender and consoling new ensemble comedy provides a glimpse into the lives of a lower-middle class Yokohama family on the day they come together to observe the anniversary of a loss in the family. <br />Its a summit of coiled emotion, a rare occasion on which parents, children and grandchildren can awkwardly air grievances while happily munching on sushi, eel and tempura. Despite the fact that every shot is loaded with anxieties about death (of family members, of tradition), the tone remains warm and ironic. The way Koreeda films  mostly discreet shots of the familys cramped suburban house  makes most directors look blind to the possibilities of locating ideas in mundane imagery, such as a drawer left slightly open, a butterfly entering the house, or cherry blossom blooming in the garden.<br /><br />His beautiful dialogue, too, favours gentle naturalism over characters breaking down and blurting out feelings, giving it a subtle universality: we see reflections of people we know and love in these characters. Koreedas almost sage-like understanding of what makes modern families tick places him and this wonderful film in the league of Japans grand master, Ozu, and you cant ask for higher praise than that.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The dusty, sun-bleached flats of Kazakhstan are deftly transformed into a simmering hotbed of romantic and familial intrigue in writer-director Sergei Dvortsevoys wise and witty inquiry into the decline of the nomadic lifestyle. Asa (Askat Kuchinchirekov) is the adorably dim ex-sailor whose search for a significant other (specifically, enigmatic local beauty Tulpan) is constantly stymied by his blundering manner, an absence of farming prowess and a gargantuan pair of lugholes. <br />Yet his protracted period of doomed courtship gives us ample time to examine the fabric of this remote society, as questions about its sustainability, practicality and principles are all raised via involving and often absurd sketches that riff on the daily struggle.<br />Despite this being his first fictional film, Dvortsevoy exhibits the storytelling composure and technical proficiency of a veteran, while his keen eye for a pastoral poetic flourish places Tulpan firmly among the years most endearing cinematic experiences. And how many films can boast a single-take shot of a baby goat being born and receiving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The latest film from Donnie Darko director Richard Kelly arrives on these shores bearing the clawmarks of American critics. But dont panic: while its true that the films sci-fi antics are far from watertight in the logic department, theres enough eccentricity and ambition at play to charm and bemuse in equal measure. Building on the short story Button, Button by The Twilight Zone writer Richard Matheson, Kelly whisks us back to late 1970s Virginia. There we meet mid-ranking Nasa scientist Arthur (James Marsden) and his crippled schoolteacher wife, Norma (Cameron Diaz, below), whom Kelly recruits as two blow-dried lab rats for a deliciously overwrought interplanetary experiment. It begins when Frank Langella (missing a left cheek) knocks on their door, drops off a contraption with a red button on it and says that if they push the button, theyll receive a million dollars  but someone they dont know will die. <br />Shooting for the technology-driven guilt-racking of Michael Hanekes Hidden  but achieving something closer to the hysteria of the Saw films  Kelly comes unstuck whenever he strains to say something smart. Points, too, are deducted for mistaking cynicism for satire, as in his 2006 folly, Southland Tales. Yet Kellys crackpot-inventor approach to filmmaking (note the second-half pile-up of nosebleeding bodysnatchers, watery gateways to Hell and sundry Arthur C Clarke quotations) has produced a provocative, Lynch-lite paranoia flick that flaunts some fascinating ideas on the destructive power of technology, the bourgeois desire for conformity and the potential horrors of parenthood. It also features a great soundtrack by Arcade Fire.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Kitsch is most enjoyable when it doesnt know its kitsch. Everyone involved in Shutter Island  most obviously director Martin Scorsese and star Leonardo DiCaprio  seem to be taking this berserk, meandering story absolutely seriously, which only serves to make an already fun psychological thriller all the more ludicrous and entertaining.<br />The film is set in 1954. DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a US marshal dispatched to the titular oceanbound asylum to investigate the disappearance of a criminally insane inmate from her locked cell. He soon begins to suspect that this remote facility isnt all it appears  is Ben Kingsleys avuncular psychiatrist really as kindly and welfare-conscious as he seems? Why are the guards so heavily armed? And whats with the mysterious lighthouse that all the patients seem so terrified of? To make matters worse theres a hurricane coming in, the generators are on the blink and Teddys new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) is starting to look decidedly shifty. Taxi Driver this aint.<br />Actually, the Scorsese movie it most resembles is his previous exercise in Hitchcockian overkill, 1991s Cape Fear. With DiCaprio rather limp and forgettable in the lead, Shutter Island lacks the centrifugal might of De Niros powerhouse central performance in the earlier film. But it compensates with pure visual, aural and narrative excess: this is modern gothic taken to its (il)logical extreme, a work of pure operatic delirium. The closest Shutter Island gets to a commanding, De Niro-like presence might be its perverse, overbearing soundtrack, a selection of the most doom-laden pieces by modern composers ranging from Kryzstof Penderecki to Max Richter. Every twist in the tale is accompanied by a frenzied flurry of violins, every moment of violence underscored by a pounding, atonal piano crescendo.<br />While the narrative, adapted from Dennis Lehanes 2003 novel, is hopelessly convoluted, the film is held together by the sheer bludgeoning force of Scorseses directorial vision. Never one to shy away from visual overindulgence, Scorsese has used Shutter Island as an excuse to really throw open his box of tricks, chucking in gaudy but strikingly beautiful dream sequences, harrowing (if rather tasteless) concentration camp flashbacks and the most thunderous, howling rainstorms this side of Suspiria. <br />In fact, Argentos film, a similarly monumental and manic triumph of style over substance, may be the most appropriate comparison here. And while Scorsese may lack the giallo masters manic invention, the tension between his natural tendency towards old-fashioned Hollywood classicism and his evident desire to cut loose gives the film its strange, irrestistible power. As senseless, perverse and unwieldy as it undoubtedly is, Shutter Island might be Scorseses most enjoyable film in a decade.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Strictly half-term fodder it may be, but this amiable kiddie flick delivers on its promises: you get lots of dogs doing cute stuff. The set-up has a brother and sister (Emma Roberts, Jake T Austin, Identi-Kit moppets) struggling to keep their pet Jack Russell terrier a secret from their pernickety foster parent (Lisa Kudrow, a game meanie). An abandoned downtown hotel provides an ideal bolt-hole and, they begin to plot, could offer kinder accommodation for the citys unwanted canines than the municipal pound. With a couple of pet shop assistants facilitating transport and product-placement doggie treats, the dream becomes reality, thanks muchly to little bros Heath Robinson-esque contraptions keeping massed pooches fed and watered while the authorities try to work out where all the strays are.<br />True, theres only the merest suggestion of an education system for these juveniles, but credibilitys secondary when youve got lots of dogs doing cute stuff. Theres a treadmill for automated walkies, a canine-operated ball thrower, while bodily functions are catered for by production-line poop-scooping. A whole spectrum of breeds, shapes and sizes supply the aww-factor (pugs with aerobics headbands), but theres some welcome emotional underpinning too, since the foster kids need a good home as much as their four-legged friends. Enter Don Cheadle as a kindly social services officer: when they start giving actors awards for films theyd rather leave off their CVs, hell be up there on the podium.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Maintaining the gothic quirks of his debut, The Nightmare Before Christmas, but adding a welcome layer of queasy childhood angst, Henry Selicks adaptation of Neil Gaimans bestseller is an original, entrancing, occasionally worrying fairy tale. When inquisitive pre-teen Coraline discovers a secret door in her family home, she stumbles into a universe of apparent perfection  and underlying danger.<br />The films biggest draw has to be its intricate visuals, particularly in 3D. Selick plays with expectations superbly, presenting a drab, grey-hued world which slowly transforms into a dazzling phantasmagoria of talking cats, flying trapezes and a uniquely terrifying villain. This dark edge will be the biggest test of the film as a commercial prospect: it may be too terrifying for the target audience. But for braver kids  and parents  this is a thrilling, even challenging ride.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Youve got to admire the sheer, infectious force of Quentin Tarantinos personality. Is there any other popular American director, who, like Tarantino, is constantly ranting and raving about cinemas glorious past and giving young filmgoers reason to extend their DVD library back beyond Star Wars? Even the name of his new film is fondly stolen from a little known Italian movie of the 1970s. Its only when you turn to Tarantinos own films that things get more tricky. For the sad truth is that Tarantino, like cheap wine, just isnt improving with age.<br />Which is an awkward reality because Tarantino obviously wants to put away childish things with this new film. Not only does Brad Pitt close the film with the self-regarding line This may well be my masterpiece, but Inglourious Basterds is a little more restrained and a little more quiet than  films like Death Proof and Kill Bill. <br />I say a little because much of the film is not quiet at all: when the music comes, its loud; when the deaths occur, theyre gruesome, even sadistic; and when the plot kicks in, its pure, wild fantasy.<br />The film moves liberally between French, German and English dialogue and takes us through five chapters. First, in 1941, we see a Nazi, Colonel Hans Landa (played by Austrian Christoph Waltz), known as The Jew Hunter, discover and kill a Jewish family in France; only the youngest daughter gets away. <br />Then were introduced to the basterds, a gang of eight Jewish-American soldiers who, while deep undercover, roam Nazi-occupied France, murdering German soldiers and collecting their scalps. Theyre led by a Tennessee goodtime boy, played by Pitt, but oddly theyre not on screen much. Pitt is lively but he disappears for a long time and is upstaged by Waltz, who gives a teasing turn of sly comedy and cruel charm. His scenes are the films best.<br />For the films final chapters, we leap to Paris in 1944, where the two stories collide. The girl who fled the Nazis, Shosanna Dreyfus (Mlanie Laurent) is now running a cinema (of course) which plays films by Riefenstahl and Pabst. A Nazi private, Frederick (Daniel Brhl), takes a shine to her. It turns out that his gun-toting heroics are being immortalised in a film produced by Goebbels, who decides that Shosannas cinema is perfect for the premiere. Shosanna and the basterds decide that the screening is their chance to strike.<br />This might be a period movie, but still we clock Tarantinos signature style  the extended, know-it-all dialogue, the tricky gunplay, the pop-cultural nods. Theres even a Mexican stand-off  la Reservoir Dogs and the obligatory nigger reference, this time in French. But this lacks the stylistic pizzazz of Tarantinos best, and by putting more emphasis than usual on the chatter it makes it more obvious that the talk often lacks wit and verve.<br />Perhaps unsurprisingly, Tarantino takes the history of cinema more seriously than the history of Europe. References to films abound: Michael Fassbenders British spy (who has an amusing, if silly, Dr Strangelove-like scene with a superior played by Mike Myers) used to be a critic and regurgitates what sounds like a Wikipedia entry on German film, while another character wonders whether he prefers Chaplin or the French silent actor Max Linder.<br />Whats not clear is what Tarantino wants to achieve: Inglourious Basterds is an immature work that doesnt know whether its a pastiche, a spoof, a counterfactual drama, a revenge tragedy or a character comedy. How can we, within a space of minutes, feel adult sympathy for a hunted Jewish family and then childish glee when a Nazis skull is crushed with a baseball bat? The one cancels out the other. <br />But perhaps the biggest faux pas is introducing real historical characters. Tarantinos inventions are big enough  not least Waltzs terrific movie Nazi  so why does he have to court implausibility by dragging in a  loony Hitler (Martin Wuttke, nothing special) and introducing Goebbels? You might imagine, too, that this film was written in the 60s: Tarantino seems blithely uninterested in more than 60 years of slow reconciliation between Europe and its past.<br />Subtle is not a word in Tarantino's lexicon. At the films heart is a fatal attempt to conflate fact with fiction and a celebration of vengeance thats misplaced and embarrassing. Loyal fans expecting a familiar patchwork of Tarantino tics and quirks  Pulp History or Kill Hitler  might not be disappointed. Those expecting anything approaching progress, cinematically or ideologically, probably will be.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Dreamworkss animated sci-fi offspring centres on the gigantic misfortunes of Susan Murphy, a feisty young thing with a crush on TV weather-dork Derek. When a meteorite strikes their wedding ceremony, Susan is affected by fallout and grows into a 50-foot chick with attitude. Shes taken to a secret underground facility where she meets her freaky co-stars, BOB (a gelatinous blob), Mr Cockroach, Missing Link (half-fish, half-ape) and a hare-brained maggot called Insectosaurus.<br /><br />Some chucklesome Airplane-style humour is unleashed during this early stage as Susan (renamed Ginormica) tries to come to terms with her size, her surroundings and her wacky new friends. But as any filmmaker knows, theres only so much jollity kids will endure before they yearn for some evil influence to stir things up, and here its in the unoriginal form of an invasion from space. Will Ginormica and friends defeat the evil aliens and, more to the point, will she ever be able to return to a normal life with Derek?<br />Monsters vs Aliens is skilfully animated and spasmodically funny, but you get the impression the films seven (!) writers ran out of ideas two-thirds of the way through, opting for a conventional succession of overwrought combat sequences and feverish hyperbole. The film is screened in both 3D and 2D, but aside from a handful of impressive 3D effects, youd be equally well-served opting for the two-dimensional version.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[Michael Hanekes extraordinary new film is a black-and-white ensemble piece set in a north German village on the eve of World War I. Its a sombre, roving drama that recreates the rituals of a rural Protestant community and imagines the private lives of its householders  the doctor, the baron, the pastor  to show how hierarchical, patriarchal and even feudal such a community may have remained even as the guns were being primed on the Western Front.<br /><br />Its a film thats broader in its focus and less direct in its efforts to shock and tease than 2005s Hidden, the Austrian directors last original film (if you skip his American remake of Funny Games in 2007). Yet it also feels like a continuation of a sort of storytelling that he developed further with Hidden. In that film, the racial guilt of an entire nation was projected through Daniel Auteuils hunted Parisian intellectual, and here again Haneke sets a drama in one period to explore issues relating to another. The White Ribbon, too, is an open-ended mystery about a crime or crimes. However, while in Hidden Haneke used the present to ponder its relationship with the past, here he does the opposite, using the past to reflect on that eras future.<br /><br />Crucially, The White Ribbon is narrated by a man whose elderly voice suggests hes relating events to us from the perspective of the 1960s or 70s. In the film, hes a sympathetic 31-year-old teacher who educates many of the children who creepily roam the village in packs and whom we see subjected to extreme discipline and punishment (and in one case, sexual abuse) at home. The teacher is not from the village, which probably gives him a more objective eye, but hes present as a series of events occurs: a doctors horse is tripped up by a wire; a woman dies in a sawmill; a barn is set ablaze.<br /><br />Our narrator suggests at the start that what we witness may explain what came later. Which, of course, this being a German story in 1913, turns the mind to fascism. One looks at the faces of the films large cast, especially its children, and wonders what would their relationship be to National Socialism? But to linger too long on such literal questions is an error. This is art, not science, and I dont think that even Haneke, that most rational of filmmakers, believes one could trace a direct line from his village to the behaviour of a nation two decades later. <br />What he offers are merely suggestions as to why a people might turn to antisocial behaviour, whether its as local as sabotaging cabbages and assaulting a disabled child or as national as following a leader whom you assist in carrying out crimes in your name. Id hesitate, too, to assume that Haneke is saying something specific about the German national character at this time. Lets not forget the key role of shame in this film: even the white ribbon of the title is a band tied around the arms of naughty children. Lets not forget, too, that it was partly the shame forced on Germany by the rest of Europe that led to the terrible events of the 1930s and 40s. <br />Faithful and striking historical reconstruction is evident throughout. The superb performances also lend a period authenticity to the film. Yet, theres also something essentially modern about Hanekes perspective: he peers into closed-off parlours and invades intimate moments (a father lectures a boy on masturbation, a child questions his sister about death) to suggest links between the psychology of domestic regimes and wider societal behaviour  links that few of these characters could have even conceived of in 1913. Its Hanekes investigative and quietly accusing contemporary eye that links repression in the home with corruption in the community beyond.<br /><br />As a thriller, this is much more muted and subtle than Hidden. The result is that theres more space for Haneke  and us  to consider the behaviour of his characters and the relationships between them. Its his least aggressive and most mature film  a masterpiece from a director who is increasingly making a habit of them.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A fairly clunky relic of Disneys spluttering 70s live-action output, 1975s Escape to Witch Mountain had the smart idea of putting two kids with telekinetic powers at the centre of a pursuit thriller. Effects technology may have progressed, but the idea of teen protagonists who can do cool stuff hardly dates for family audiences, hence this retooled version. Modernisation also brings a starring role for Dwayne The Rock Johnson, as a Las Vegas cabbie who picks up an unusual fare  two peroxide-blonde youngsters (Alexander Ludwig, Anna Sophia Robb) with a penchant for circumlocutory English, a wad of cash and the power to move objects at will. Turns out theyre extraterrestrials, whose mission to save their planet could have ramifications for our own survival, especially if theyre collared by shady government agents tracking them in a fleet of black SUVs.<br />Leading man Johnson manages to exude brawn while keeping within the bounds of the PG rating, but though amiable, his acting limitations are exposed by a plot requiring him to express wonderment at the interplanetary shenanigans. Theres no shortage of zingy (if derivative) material, but the filmmakers seem content with anodyne chase sequences and tired action moves, which register little impact. Its pacy all right, but glib and uninvolving for grown-ups, though perhaps furnished with enough in the way of spaceships, lasers and digital explosions to pacify undemanding little uns of an afternoon.]]></review>

Despite its relative brevity, its a garbled and monotonous film, comprising of the usual episodic trek around various disparate and exotic locations where a band of mostly superfluous hangers-on are assembled, one of which is Chow Yun-Fat as an ass-grabbing sensei and who, frankly, deserves better than this. Making no effort to be original, exciting, witty or even vaguely plausible, it may pass the time as sparkly fodder for 12-year-old boys with plenty of sugar in their bloodstream. Parents, meanwhile, will have to make do with sniggering at lines like The Dragonballs are within my grasp!.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Not since Jacques Doillons enchanting 1996 drama Ponette have the collective, small-scale traumas and vertiginous learning curve that come with a childhood on the lam been captured with such psychological diligence and hardscrabble poetics as in this autumnal, toddlers-eye heartbreaker. Drawing on memories of her own painful upbringing in the deprived outskirts of Seoul, writer-director Kim So-yeong delivers a miraculously poised and precise film examining a key stage in the upbringing of mop-topped sisters Jin (Kim Hee-yeon) and Bin (Kim Song-hee). <br />When loving but emotionally damaged Mom packs them off to live with their callous, self-serving aunt, the two girls find themselves in a dire predicament. Deprived of parental affection and behavioural boundaries, theyre left largely to their own devices (masterminding a miniature barbecued grasshopper business, of course) as their aunt drinks away her meagre income, showing little interest in the emotional needs of her surrogate brood. But matters improve when theyre marched off to their grandparents farm and finally locate a kindred spirit in their sagacious Grandmother, whose inconspicuous fondness for the pair comes across as a defiant act of cross-generational empowerment. <br />Via the disconcertingly unaffected performances of the two pint-sized leads, the film subtly and credibly charts the ways young children cultivate a sense of family, friendship, economy, age and geography through physical interactions with people and surroundings. Conversely, Kims film also offers a stark analysis of the human potential for random cruelty that recalls nothing less than Bressons Mouchette, albeit with a denouement that holds a glimmer of optimism for the future.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[You couldnt call this audacious British debut a success; its too arch, awkward and over-extended for that. But, oddly, its those very same qualities which make it arresting to watch and which mark out its two directors as talents to keep an eye on. Helen (Annie Townsend) is a plain-faced 17 year old in foster care who works part-time as a hotel cleaner and whose college mate Joy has disappeared in the woods of a town that looks and sounds like it might be Newcastle but is never identified. When the police arrive at Joys college looking for a stand-in for a reconstruction, they pick Helen, who takes to wearing Joys yellow coat, flirting with her boyfriend and even seeking help with her homework from Joys father. This is all executed in a peculiar, spooky fashion: long takes, disjointed episodes, a mixture of wide shots and a series of close-ups. The photography is striking  but even more striking is how extraordinarily wooden the performances and the dialogue are.<br /><br />Is this simply bad filmmaking? Or is it an experiment that only half works? Id go for the latter. What the directors are seeking is a metaphysical spin on a realistic set-up: an attempt to get inside and explore Helens head with a big, credible event as backdrop. We must assume, though, that Helens encounters are flights of fancy for a girl who has never enjoyed the same comforts as her peers, so the film is good on ideas of identity and how youngsters can project others lives onto their own to survive. It doesnt fully work, but its daring is enough to recommend it.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p><i>Read an interview with the director here<br /></i><br />After the back-to-back bleakness of Brokeback Mountain and Lust, Caution, Ang Lee takes a well-deserved breather with this breezy, none-too-rigorous investigation into the men behind the iconic music festival. On one hand its a featherlight, surprisingly broad comedy which swallows the hippie-dream propaganda whole; on the other its a winningly un-cynical, warmly nostalgic tale of simple self-discovery.<br />Gay, Jewish and desperately seeking purpose, Elliot Tiber (Demetri Martin) leaves his liberated NYC existence to help his parents with their crumbling rustic motel upstate. Hearing about a major rock festival seeking a home, Elliott offers his small hometown as a venue, the motel as mission control and his own services as local liaison.<br />Anyone with an ounce of scepticism about the hippie myth will be infuriated by Taking Woodstock, a film so starry-eyed and winsome it would make Joni Mitchell blush. But leave those preconceptions at the door and theres a lot to enjoy here: hipster stand-up Martin is agreeably off-kilter in his first feature role, backed by a dizzying array of memorable supporting players, notably Imelda Staunton channeling Mel Brooks as Elliots crotchety, Nazi-obsessed mother and Brit theatre and TV actor Henry Goodman in a remarkable turn as put-upon dad Jake. <br />But the real star is Lees direction. Goosing Godard with an epic track through traffic, loading the screen with whirling naked bodies, withholding the epic scale of the festival until Elliot (and the cinematography) are blitzed to the gills on LSD, this may be a minor movie, but it displays the hallmarks of a major talent.</p><p><i>Read an interview with the director here</i><br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Filmmakers love a good prison. No, scrub that, filmmakers adore a bad prison. You can see why. For writers and directors, the volatile jail is a ready-made theatre, its prisoners and guards with their various conflicts and loyalties all perfect players for a drama that, if it tries hard enough, can reflect life on the outside too. <br />For French director Jacques Audiard (A Self-Made Hero, The Beat That My Heart Skipped), a master of the old-school French thriller  ie thrilling and meaningful  his fifth film offers the chance to pull off both a state-of-nation primal scream and a terrific crime flick. He gives us Malik (Tahar Rahim), a French-Arab convict who enters a concrete-and-steel hell to serve a sentence of six years (so we know he cant have done anything too dreadful). He tries to keep his head down, but this isnt that sort of place. The ruling bully boys are the Corsican inmates, led by ageing but vicious Csar (Niels Arestrup), who forces Malik to kill another inmate in a very successful scene thats one of the most claustrophobic and disturbing episodes Ive seen in a long while. From here, Malik is Csars vassal, committed to working for him on the inside and, later, using a series of day-release excursions to represent his criminal interests on the outside.<br /><br />But Malik is a clever individualist  a survivalist even  and at the same time that he learns to read and write, he exploits a friendship with another French-Arab prisoner, now released, to pursue his own drug deals and quietly invest in a power base within the jail. This is a world where partnerships are formed only for a reason, loyalties are fluid, friends barely exist at all. Politically, its a cynical film. Hope is absent.<br />Whether, though, it says anything meaningful about France, Im not so sure. Malik is an extreme character, so his experience doesnt reflect the French-Arab dilemma as a whole, even if the point is made about the number of immigrants in French jails and how being sent to prison for a minor offence can snowball into something else entirely. Audiard suggests that being an underdog  socially, racially, economically  in an unfriendly society can lead to desocialisation and anti-social behaviour. But Maliks story is so wild that it obscures such ideas.<br /><br />That said, its testament to Audiards skill at plunging us headfirst into a vicious parallel world that we mostly believe the films twisted logic and rituals. Also, his presentation of violence as a profit-and-loss account is effective and mature: while Maliks initial murder may get him far, we witness nightly visions of his victim coming back to his cell to haunt him. But there are several bite-your-tongue moments. The film is realist in style and mood, but for every five spot-on observations, there is one flight of wild fancy. Ive seen the film twice and still find baffling an episode in which Malik predicts that a deer will hit a car, thereby suggesting he is a prophet.<br />But the sheer force of Audiards direction can support such enigmas. It forces you, bullies you, persuades you to love his filmmaking style  even if not always to understand his motives.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[So whats killing the planet this week? Thats right, its food: specifically the kind of mass-produced, factory-farmed, chemically treated and genetically modified junk that we all know is bad for us  but we secretly love. Inspired by co-producer Eric Schlossers bestselling 2002 polemic Fast Food Nation, this solidly constructed documentary aims to do for food production what An Inconvenient Truth did for global warming: namely, to make audiences angry and politicans take note.<br />Its a somewhat bitty, dissolute experience  you get the feeling any one of these skimmed-over stories could have sustained an entire documentary. But director Robert Kenner succeeds in constructing a powerful, convincingly nightmarish vision of America on the slide: a country where marketability trumps sustainability, where public health is sacrificed in favour of profit, where labour unions are crushed and animal rights are an irrelevance. In recent years, films like The End of the Line have proved that movies are capable of provoking direct action: lets hope Food Inc can drum up the same fervour before we all succumb to the obesity epidemic.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Guy Ritchie the director and Guy Ritchie the screenwriter part ways for this latest spin on the Sherlock Holmes story, and if separation turns into divorce it would be no bad thing, at least on the evidence of this big-hearted, atmospheric entertainment. Shed of his tedious infatuation with off-the-peg London gangsters, Ritchie proves a competent teller of the fast-paced, not po-faced yarn. Here, Robert Downey Jr draws on his wild-eyed side to play the detective, while Jude Law assumes the more sober clothes of his sidekick, Dr Watson. Plunging into their careers mid-flow, we watch as they confront a conspiracy of national proportions. <br />They discover an aristocrat, Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), in the middle of a ritualistic murder of a young woman. In this early scene, Ritchies Holmes reveals himself as a physical titan in a witty interlude in which we witness in slow motion the microscopic details of his plan to incapacitate an assailant by brute force. The villain hangs, but, for Holmes and Watson, this is just the start of a series of fights, rescues, escapes and revelations, all cloaked in creaky supernatural mumbo jumbo.<br />Ritchies Sherlock Holmes is effective as a caricatured comedy adventure and shows some fidelity to Arthur Conan Doyle, especially in Downey Jrs portrayal of the eccentric but cold-hearted Holmes. The banter between Holmes and Watson isnt as witty as it should be, but the detectives lone mutterings, especially his deductions, are fun. The films biggest success is its evocation of Victorian London, via much location work and CG rendering: here, Ritchies grittily romantic view of our city comes into its own, culminating in a delicious climax on the girders of a half-built Tower Bridge.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[If there was a gold statuette for wall-to-wall compassion, Precious would wipe the floor with its rivals this awards season. Director Lee Daniels and writer Geoffrey Fletchers adaptation of Sapphires novel Push oozes empathy from the first scene to the last. Its inescapably bleak, but occasionally it has the confidence and spirit to emerge from the shadows of its tragic story  the tale of Precious (Gabourey Sidibe), an obese 16-year-old teenager in 1980s Harlem who is abused by her mother and father  to indulge in sly humour and jolly camaraderie before retreating again into the darkness at its heart.<br />My names Clarissa Precious Jones and I want to be on the cover of a magazine, says Sidibe. What she gets is less glitzy: we learn of the gross difference between the refuge of her mind and the reality of her life. When her vile mother (MoNique, grotesque, chilling but in the end almost sympathetic) screams, I should have aborted your motherfuckin ass, Precious imagines herself walking the red carpet at a film premiere. Perhaps most movingly, when she looks in the mirror, she sees a girl who is more beautiful and more white.<br />So, a better life is possible, but imagination just isnt enough: Precious is a film about real escape, not dreams. The film celebrates a winning combination of individual strength, education and community over the warped logic of the sort of corrupt household where a loveless grandma puts on a wig and feigns love for a Downs syndrome child, a piece of theatre to secure a cheque from a visiting social worker. Its a film that acknowledges poverty and inequality while refusing to believe that people cant escape from their grip. Its a truly American movie. Its realism is social  not socialist  and its happy flights of imagination recall the magical side of Danny Boyle more than the grit of Ken Loach.<br />Slowly, surely, Precious attends a special school with an inspirational teacher (Paula Patton), begins sessions with a social worker (Mariah Carey, unobtrusive) and fights her silent, violent and self-loathing tendencies to make new friends, a colourful bunch of girls in her class, from a mouthy Jamaican immigrant to a tough nut from The Bronx. Its not an easy battle and Daniels has a tendency to land new blows when you think the fight is over. So oppressive and extreme is Preciouss background that you imagine terrible things are about to happen even when theyre not. I didnt find the film as actively upsetting as many have reported  merely very, very sad.<br />The film arrives here after winning prizes at Toronto and Sundance and gaining four Bafta nominations. So, should you believe the hype? Yes and no. Precious is very affecting and has some great performances, especially from Sidibe and MoNique, but the film is arguably more heart than art. Is that such a bad thing? Perhaps not: when a film shines a light on a desperate way of life and gives dignity to characters barely ever portrayed on screen, you can forgive some clumsy, emphatic storytelling and a narrative thats too episodic and reliant on voiceover. Its a film full of life and love, well-meaning and, judging by the reaction in the US, a genuine and important phenomenon that says act  dont dwell  on your dreams. A genuine Obama-era movie, then. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A number of doom-laden docs have already highlighted the effect our lifestyles are having on the planet. Well, heres another one to cheer us up. The film has a simple message: modern technology has caused us to over-fish drastically our oceans and, unless something is done, well be eating jellyfish n chips by 2048. Director Rupert Murray (Unknown White Male) takes us to Newfoundland, where cod have been fished out of existence; to China, a country which allegedly altered its catch-quota results to give a false impression of its dwindling fish stocks; and to the Strait of Gibraltar where sushi favourite, bluefin tuna, is in steep decline. The poignant facts and figures are offered by a host of likeable marine scientists, local fishermen and activists. The film is both a strangely entertaining antidote to TVs excellent Trawlermen series, and a sobering call to arms.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The scramble to keep kids entertained over the summer months continues with this underwhelming spin on ET and Gremlins. Dragged off to a remote mansion for the summer months, precocious teen Tom (Carter Jenkins) and his self-obsessed sister Bethany (Ashley Tisdale) uncover a devious alien plot to launch a worldwide mind-control invasion from their loft. <br />Theres not a great deal to recommend: a few decent one-liners, some inventive anti-gravity slapstick and a brief but enjoyably bonkers remote-controlled kung-fu battle between one of the kids and Toms brain-zapped granny. But such fleeting charms are largely outweighed by an unexceptional script, a brace of shabby performances (from both kids and adults) and some dismal CG effects: the aliens appear almost transparent, like animated transfers barely clinging to the screen. Aliens in the Attic will probably prove an effective distraction for undemanding pre-teens; their parents might find it more of a chore.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Read an interview with Anderson here<br /></i><br />Take a few seconds to think back over Wes Andersons films and imagine how a stop-motion animated version of Roald Dahls Fantastic Mr Fox might look and sound if directed by this Euro-leaning, Texan caricaturist. Would it, like The Life Aquatic and Rushmore, offer a hyper-realistic uniform of sets and costumes? Would it, like The Darjeeling Limited and The Royal Tenenbaums, explore an eccentric family, with a father figure looming large and relatives at loggerheads? Would the soundtrack include the Rolling Stones? Would there be a role for Bill Murray? Jason Schwartzman? Owen Wilson? Would it be hip? Would the comedy have a gentlemanly sophistication and even be wilfully exclusive? Would it trade in emotions but feel distancing at times? <br />Of course, as anyone familiar with Andersons films will know, the answer to all these questions is yes. So it turns out: this is an animation, but its also a Wes Anderson movie. The difference is that its light on its feet compared to the heavy machinery of The Life Aquatic or the ponderous comedy of The Darjeeling Limited. Its also a kids film, which allows Anderson and his gang  is there another director so collegiate?  to have fun. Anderson himself voices a fey estate agent, and the film has the pace of a caper. <br />What remains to be seen is how audiences, especially children, will react to the jolty, bristling look of stop-motion animation in the age of CGI and digital 3D. The loving, handmade, purist look of the film, reminiscent of Gondrys The Science of Sleep, sees towelling as fields, cellophane as water and cotton wool as smoke, and will probably excite adults more than their kids who will be more taken by the constant, active missions of the plot  elements that, in turn, grow a little tedious if youre a grown-up.<br />Dahls book was a short, sharp affair illustrated in pen and ink by Quentin Blake, whose drawings dont have much bearing on Andersons version: his colour palette takes its cue from the autumnal hues of fox fur. The main characters in Dahls book were Mr Fox himself, a dapper chap trying to protect his family from danger, and his foes, three cider-swilling farmers, Boggis, Bunce and Bean. Anderson and co-writer Noah Baumbach (who directed The Squid and the Whale) have fleshed out the story so that there are more characters (Willem Dafoes jive-talking rat is genius) and the Fox family has more personality: Mrs Fox (Meryl Streep) is the voice of reason to her husbands impetuousness, while their son Ash (Schwartzman), a needy, moody teen, is pitched against a kung-fu-kicking cousin, Kristofferson (Eric Anderson), who comes to stay. <br />Mr Fox, voiced so appropriately by George Clooney, flits between human behaviour (buying a house, starting a career) and animal instincts (stealing chickens, attacking his food). The push and pull between the tame life and the wild one is the unifying theme. Its all very transatlantic  the setting and baddies are English; the animals are hip Americans. This is one crafty fox  in every sense.<br /><i>Read an interview with Anderson here</i><br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Although far better than its troubled history lead one to fear, this gory, gothic take on the classic lycanthropic love story has had its romantic heart ripped out. Returning to his estranged fathers crumbling pile in 1891  to investigate his brothers disappearance  actor Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) falls for his dead siblings mourning fiance, Gwen (Emily Blunt). But before this spark of love can ignite, Lawrence is bitten by the lunar-tic creature the locals fear, and must confront the beast buried within himself. With its mist-shrouded sets, gruesome slaughter and copious CGI, this is a surprisingly respectful updating of the 1941 Universal original. Thanks to Rick Bakers make-up effects, Del Toros transformations from handsome lover to hairy, howling beast are frighteningly convincing; Anthony Hopkins is restrained as his emotionally detached father; and a cruelly underused Blunt is all-a-quiver as the beautiful, bereaved Gwen. Ultimately, though, neither Joe Johnstons efficient direction nor Danny Elfmans hard-working score can lift the familiar storyline out of the ordinary. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Best wipe 8 1/2 from your mind, or at least delay seeing Fellinis loopy masterpiece, if youre going to enjoy this angsty romp through the directors 1963 film about a fictional Italian filmmaker, Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis), who loses his mojo and might be about to lose his marbles and his marriage.<br />Surprisingly, though, theres lots in this musical version, itself an adaptation of a 1980s Broadway show, that relates to the sombre heart of Fellinis original. We still get Guidos formative childhood memory of watching a prostitute perform on the beach (although this time it is Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas brilliantly belting out the films foot-tapping anthem Be Italian). We also get the lingering ghost of his mother (Sophia Loren!), the pain of his adultery and the madness of his creative impasse. Also, Fellinis meshing of dream and reality is oddly suited to the unreal tendencies of a musical, although its anybodys guess what the director would have made of Penlope Cruz throwing herself around in stockings and suspenders and upping the sex factor beyond anything Claudia Cardinale offered in the original.<br />The biggest difference, though, is that almost 50 years later, director Rob Marshall (Chicago) is able to play the story of 8 1/2 as a nostalgia piece. He fetishises the look and feel of 1960s Italy and especially Rome so that the films mood of artistic melancholia is expressed on a canvas that comes dangerously close to looking like an ad for Italian coffee. Marshall and his writers, including the late Anthony Minghella, also stress the humour of Guidos philandering, often preferring that his inner turmoil goes no further than chain-smoking. To give Day-Lewis his due, the actor grounds the films sillier tendencies in a charming performance of mercurial despair. Hes well supported by Marion Cotillard, who conveys the sadness of being Guidos wife, although both Nicole Kidman as his leading lady and Kate Hudson as an admiring journalist are little more than window-dressing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Taiji, Japan. A tourist town with a face it doesnt want anyone to see. Off-limits to prying eyes is an inlet where local fishermen carry out the clandestine slaughter of thousands of dolphins each year. Why kill these sea-going mammals, when the mercury-packed meat has to be re-labelled as whale to sell cheaply in supermarkets? Well, the demand from dolphin shows worldwide  which will pay 100, 000 per prime specimen  makes the cull economically viable. None of this is illegal, since the International Whaling Commission has no jurisdiction over dolphins and porpoises, but it is now being brought to global attention thanks to tireless activist Richard OBarry, at whose behest director Louie Psihoyos and his crew used risky subterfuge to capture shocking footage of these previously unseen iniquities.<br />Theres an effective thriller element to this vividly assembled doc, as we see surveillance equipment hidden inside fake rocks and champion divers planting underwater cameras under cover of darkness. Elsewhere, though the Taiji fishing community wont win any kudos for its diplomacy, theres also encouraging resistance from some local councillors battling for change. However, what lifts the film beyond effective consciousness-raising into the realms of human tragedy, is the startling irony that project instigator OBarry is none other than the trainer of 60s TV icon Flipper, whose popularity spawned the whole dolphin show explosion in the first place. The sadness in his eyes, a window on the churning emotions he must confront on a daily basis, proves the most haunting image in a film that will leave you better informed, tearful and really angry.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Sam Taylor-Woods first feature film is an astute rock n roll soap opera about the late teenage years of John Lennon. Its also a bit of a tease. In the opening scene we hear the first chord of Hard Days Night, the sound of screaming girls, a nod to Richard Lesters film of the same name and then nothing. In class, the distracted schoolboy John doodles walruses. On the way home, he passes Strawberry Fields. Much later, just as the film is about to end with John walking up a leafy street, about to leave Liverpool for Hamburg and history, his aunt mentions the change of his bands name from The Quarrymen to and, no, the name doesnt pass her lips. The film tiptoes around the future. The Beatles are the elephant in the scene.<br />In recent years, its become the rule that good films about musicians are formally loopy, while the less interesting ones play it straight. So its thumbs up for 24 Hour Party People and Im Not There and a pleasant shrug for Walk the Line and Ray. But Nowhere Boy shows no interest in redefining the form: Lennon was a pasty white bloke and so, unlike in Todd Hayness Bob Dylan film, its a pasty white bloke who plays him (the young, brooding Aaron Johnson, an actor who grows on you but is never quite right); the story is chronological; the narrator is reliable. Taylor-Woods background might be in video art but her approach to cinema is fundamentally different. She offers a conservative package with the odd radical flourish. Some of her choices, such as following Lennon and a pal as they ride on the top of a bus, are populist, even jarring, and suggest that she may not have fully found her own language on this first attempt.<br />Taylor-Wood and screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh mostly play it safe, offering an accessible period piece, free of nostalgia and full of key and credible emotional flashpoints. They focus sensitively on relationships, and especially those Lennon had with his aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott Thomas), with whom he lived, and his absent mother, Julia (Anne-Marie Duff), who came back into his life for the short period in the late 1950s covered by the film. The music and the meeting of the boys who became The Beatles take a back seat to this domestic drama. Even the early bonding of John with a more fresh-faced Paul (Thomas Sangster) is explained by the loss, in one way or another, of their respective mothers. When the only Lennon song in the film  Mother  plays over the closing credits, its a confirmation of the films chief theme: mums and the shadow they cast.<br />The two key performances come from Scott Thomas and Duff as the two women in Lennons life. Scott-Thomas plays Mimi as a prude whose attitude is born of protectiveness rather than instinct. Duff, meanwhile, pulls off the trick of being more likeable but less trustworthy. The most interesting element of the film is Taylor-Woods suggestion of a latent sexual chemistry between John and his mother, an idea that rather than feeling wild or gratuitous comes across as a sensible observation about a vulnerable but adventurous adolescent. <br />]]></review>

Were drawn under the waves of the sea to a hidden enclave of neon-hued aqualife more vibrant, surreal and enchanting than any of the floating 3D whatsits in Avatar. Miyazaki offers a spin on Hans Christian Andersens The Little Mermaid and subverts his source to explore the main theme of all his films: the unpredictable psychologies of kids separated from their parents. The film charts a key episode in the life of bowl-cutted scamp, Sosuke, and the sweet bond he forms with Ponyo, a squeaky-voiced goldfish-turned-human girl. Among the films pleasures are yet another heartbreaking evocation of the trials of childhood (particularly the complexity of forming friendships), a non-patronising depiction of old age and a trenchant yet subtle reminder of looming ecological catastrophes. Who knows why it didnt receive an Oscar nomination for Best Animation?]]></review>

One can see why. A miscast Rene Zellweger plays social worker Emily Jenkins who, after saving ten-year-old Lilith (Jodelle Ferland) from being roasted alive in her mad parents oven, offers her a home. <br />At first, Emily thinks that Lilith is a classic damaged child, but then people start dying: one of Liliths classmates bludgeons his parents to death; Emilys boyfriend is killed by a swarm of hornets. Sceptical sheriff Mike Barron (a somnambulant Ian McShane) insists that a damaged, deceitful, manipulative child is not a demon, but by now Emilys do-gooder has pitched over into wild-eyed hysteria, raving about how Lilith is a malevolent catalyst who causes her victims to hallucinate their deepest, darkest fears. This is horror hokum of the cheesiest kind. Rent Orphan instead.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Anyone hoping that Peter Jackson may have returned to the more intimate territory of 1994s Heavenly Creatures for his version of Alice Sebolds novel must resign themselves to the fact that Jacksons filmmaking DNA may have become irreversibly modified. The source material might be more down to earth than King Kong, but Jackson does everything in his power to ditch the real in favour of fantasy.<br />The book was narrated from the grave by Susie Salmon (played by Saoirse Ronan in the film), a 14-year-old girl who is raped and murdered near her home. From a vantage point between heaven and earth, Susie follows her parents (Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz), her sister (Rose McIver) and her killer, Mr Harvey (Stanley Tucci), as she  and they  struggle to accept her fate. Not that we see anyone raped or murdered in this $100 million, 12A version: Jackson fatally softens the edges of the tragedy and its fallout.<br />The real let-down is the films reliance on overblown effects to represent Susies limbo. Coming across as if Dali was commissioned to paint Middle Earth for the New Zealand tourist board, the CGI scenes sideline the cast in favour of the magic of the animators hard drive. And it doesnt help that a gin-swigging Susan Sarandon plays Susies grandmother for comic effect just when you feel the film could do with some weight. And whos telling this story? It should be Susie, and at points she narrates. But theres no consistency.<br /><br />Is she a ghost? A narrator? A heroine? A victim? Her chocolate-box world suggests its a 14-year-olds view of life. Yet there are entire sections when we forget Susies all-seeing eye and dont know whether were in a drama, a thriller or a horror.<br />Watch this confused, unhappy film and weep a little for Lynne Ramsay (Ratcatcher), the British director who was first commissioned to write and direct it before it was swept away from her by higher powers.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hankies at the ready, folks. Bearing similarities to 2007s And When Did You Last See Your Father?, The Boys Are Back is a moving examination of father-son relations adapted from a memoir. Joe (Clive Owen) is a British sports journalist  the alter ego of The Independents Simon Carr, the original author  who is living in Australia and must renew his relationship with his six-year-old son Artie (Nicholas McAnulty) when his wife Katy (Laura Fraser) dies suddenly from cancer. <br />Still grieving, Joe takes a questionable and at times worrying laissez-faire approach to parenting (he calls it just say yes) as he tries to juggle work with child-rearing and at the same time maintain relations with a difficult mother-in-law and repair his bond with Harry (George MacKay), a teenage son from a previous marriage who breaks off his public-school education in Britain to come and stay with his father. The moment you think youre sorted is the moment it all starts falling apart, says Owens downbeat but sympathetic voiceover.<br />The material may sound sentimental, but director Scott Hicks (Shine) mostly avoids soppiness, even if hes not afraid to make the odd desperate plea for empathy, and a final-reel chapter in the UK is jarring in its need for easy resolution. Hicks is well served by an endearing Owen, whose performance must rank as one of his best, and some beautiful photography from rising Aussie Greig Fraser (Bright Star), whose landscape shots give us room to breathe away from domestic mayhem. Hickss directing style is straightforward and unfussy  a description you could apply to this big-hearted film as a whole.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Up in the Air seeks comedy from two of Americas  indeed the Western worlds  most current fears: flying and redundancy. A tough ask, you might think, but director Jason Reitman offers an enjoyable balance of laughs and sorrows, pratfalls and body blows, even if this charming road movie (or should that be air movie?), adapted by Reitman and screenwriter Sheldon Turner from a 2001 novel by Walter Kirn, finally doesnt end up anywhere nearly as interesting or original as the enticing signposts suggest en route.<br />This is Reitmans third film after Thank You for Smoking and Juno, both of which were much less assured when it came to marrying social reality and laughs. George Clooney is Ryan Bingham, a bachelor and corporate lone gun who derives more pleasure from the 300-plus days a year he spends travelling around the country making people redundant than the 43 miserable ones he spends at home in a characterless apartment, out of step with the parochial glamour of his middle-rung executive lifestyle.<br />Bingham, played winningly straight by Clooney, is a rare airborne species whose entire existence is threatened when his company hires tight-faced, thrusting young graduate Natalie Keener (a fun Anna Kendrick) to reassess the companys operations. This preppy pipsqueaks big idea is to stop sending reps around the country and instead give clients employees their marching orders via a glorified version of Skype. Its an idea that falls sympathetically on credit-crunched managerial ears, although Binghams worried reaction reflects our conflicted response to the movie as a whole: half of him fears for those about to be sacked by satellite, while the other half fears losing a lifestyle that allows him to indulge in pleasures such as no-strings affairs with fellow travellers like Alex (Vera Farmiga), a good-time lady who implores him to think of me as yourself with a vagina. We might sympathise with those clearing their desks, but the threat of not being able to tag along with Clooney for the ride feels just as critical. Its an honest point: empathy only ever stretches so far.<br />For all its superficial topicality, Up in the Air mostly feels old-fashioned, nostalgic even, in its fond lament for a pre-9/11 world of travel. There are no security scares in this world. Its fetishisation of the rituals of flying is near-pornographic, with check-in girls substituting for bedfellows and frequent-flyer cards for sex toys. Binghams winning of millions of air miles come across as notches on his bed post. Hes the Warren Beatty of interstate business travel.<br />Its a pleasure to watch an adult American comedy that tries to deal with the real world, however much of a fantasy it carves from it. But the films later scenes as Bingham attends the wedding of a distant sister and has to face some ground-level realities about himself and his relationships are not as convincing or edifying as they should be and his sideline in motivational speaking never rings true as a symbol of his changing attitude to life. The films final announcement that even the most frequent flights of imagination have to touch down at some point is conventional and a little disappointing. But the journey is a riot while it lasts.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Read an interview with Scherfig here</i><br />This is Fish Tank for the suburbs: semis, not slums; safe, not sorry. Journalist Lynn Barbers spiky memoir of striking up a relationship with an older man in early 1960s west London has been turned into an accessible comedy romance by screenwriter Nick Hornby that seems designed to play extraordinarily well in the very same privet-lined streets it describes.<br />Its true that Barber, in her book, saw more absurdity than seediness in her youthful engagement to a criminal Jack the Lad at the same time as she was preparing to apply to Oxford from her Twickenham grammar school. But Hornby softens the edges further so that David (Peter Sarsgaard), her flashy suitor, is more charming than predatory, more vulnerable than cunning. The paedophile question is side-stepped entirely, even turned into a gag, and good-looking, redeemable Sarsgaard doesnt appear to be in his late thirties, as Barber assumes in her memoir, even if he claimed to be 27 to her 16. Hornbys script also makes too much of the peril of  God forbid  not getting into Oxford so that the film ends on an odd note that seeks false drama and resolution in Jenny being accepted or not at the university.<br />Luckily, Danish director Scherfig and star Mulligan give the film considerable weight by surrounding this lightly played, strange romance with both an acute understanding of Barbers endearing screen alter ego, Jenny (Mulligan), and incisive material about the differences between this know-it-all young lady and her less worldly mum (Cara Seymour) and dad (Alfred Molina), for whom wine is a Christmas treat and the French are the enemy across the water. Its through them that we see the first chink of light in the generation gap that would widen as the decade went on.<br />Theres a persistent comic tone which makes the light treatment of Jenny and Davids affair more palatable than it should be. This is provided partly by Molina and Seymour as the likeable, misguided parents, but partly by Rosamund Pikes brilliant empty-headed posh fluff, Helen, one of the early 1960s urban beau monde that includes Dominic Cooper as Helens louche boyfriend, who glides with David from nightclub to art auction to dog track with Jenny in tow.<br />As Jenny, Mulligan offers a great impression of Audrey Hepburn once she ties up her hair, throws off her school uniform and puts on an expensive, modish dress and jewellery. She is simply excellent in the role, the perfect mix of naivety and maturity beyond her characters years. She has a strong but down-to-earth beauty which alone does much to compensate for some of the films less convincing, broader moments.<br /><i>Read an interview with Scherfig here</i><br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Atom Egoyan only directs  not writes  this more slick, less subtle but still enjoyably barmy remake of Nathalie, the 2003 film which saw a middle-aged Parisian (Fanny Ardant) employ a hooker (Emmanuelle Bart) to seduce her philandering husband (Grard Depardieu) and report on the details. <br />There was something so French about the original (the implicit acceptance of adultery, for one) that its not surprising that the emphasis has changed so that the affairs of the husband (Liam Neeson) are less certain and more of a possibility that prompts the hiring of Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) by his wife (Julianne Moore). <br />But theres a literalism that disappoints: just when youre enjoying the suggestion that the entire set-up is reflective of the wifes turmoil or, at least, her mid-life crisis, the story takes a silly turn into stalker-thriller territory. Egoyans style is strictly arthouse-accessible: soft colours and dark shadows; modern architecture; a hint of erotica and the odd nipple shot.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Gathering his marbles (and any other weather-damaged, spring-loaded knick-knacks that may be in the vicinity) after the sepia-hued slushfest of A Very Long Engagement (2004), Frances master craftsman, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, returns with a comic potshot at the arms industry that makes for a hearty, if modest, return to form. <br />Firmly cleaving to his instantly distinguishable ersatz style in which cogs, pulleys and levers are tossed at the screen whenever possible, his story follows a band of oddballs as they administer a convoluted course of revenge on the tyrannical directors (Nicolas Mari and Andr Dussollier) of two rival weapons manufacturers. The catalyst for all this is the plight of body-popping video-store assistant Bazil (Dany Boon), whose father, we learn, is killed by a French-made landmine. To add injury to insult, Bazil is caught in the crossfire of a gun battle and gets a locally produced bullet lodged in his brain.<br />While its admirable that Jeunet has attempted to channel the mirth into a serious, unequivocally political statement, he does little to allow us to take his gestures seriously: its as if, say, Jacques Tati had chosen to make a film about the Rwandan genocide and insisted on keeping the silly hat. The point at which were supposed to see the funny side of extraordinary rendition is the glib gibe that pushes it over the edge. Yet, the film has its pleasures, namely the nimble, assured camera work and a script (written with regular Jeunet collaborator Guillaume Laurant) that constantly evokes the droll spirit of his hero, Jacques Prvert. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Towards the end of the Coen brothers The Big Lebowski, a black-clad German complains that a situation isnt fair. Fair? splutters Walter Sobchak (John Goodman). Whos the fucking nihilist around here?! Life isnt fair for the lead of the Coens latest, A Serious Man, either: Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a mild-mannered mathematics professor in 1967 suburban Jewish Minnesota, is struggling with a crumbling marriage, alienated kids, a burdensome brother, malicious professional rumours, a siren neighbour and incessant calls from a mail-order record company. Unlike the nihilists, however, Larry has faith: he is a conscientious Jew and tries to be a serious man. So, to quote a Jefferson Airplane song from the films soundtrack, when the truth is found to be lies and all the hope within you dies Then what?<br />Glanced at in many of the Coens earlier films, Jewishness is front and centre here, from the shtetl-set, Yiddish-speaking prologue to the hermetically Jewish community in which Larry lives. Drawing on the actual milieu of their own adolescence, the filmmakers  past masters of outr production design and sardonic genre subversion  play things relatively straight to tell a story that, for all its plentiful absurdities, is sincerely engaged with the challenge of unjust suffering. Bewildered, desperate, nose twitching in perplexity, Stuhlbargs Larry has been compared to Job; understandably, given his host of burdens and the settings Old Testament overtones. Yet Larry is perhaps closer to Kafkas Josef K, another put-upon character who suffers an unwarranted ordeal without quite being heroic.<br />The Coens nod at some familiar stylistic tropes  florid swearing, sexual euphemism, crusty, aged characters  but the films potency is rooted in quiet precision and detailed realisation. Roger Deakinss typically polished photography gives an oppressively hard edge to Midwestern suburbia while the sound design is a wondrous melange of soup-slurping, hacking coughs, gastric juices and ominous clanging. Stuhlbarg, a Tony-winning stage actor, leads a largely unknown but impeccable cast that also includes Sari Lennick as Larrys no-nonsense wife, Fred Melamed as her smug, unctuous lover and Richard Kind as Larrys sad-sack brother, forever draining a cyst on his neck.<br />Established religion offers Larry little consolation but the idea of faith, or at least good living, that emerges from his struggle matches the sensibility the Coens have unobtrusively espoused throughout their work: reject worldly status, bear trials with humility, find joy in fellow-feeling. Bad things happen to good people. To acknowledge  even, as storytellers, to embrace  this fact is not to indulge in nihilism, but to make more urgent the social task that might mitigate its effects. You better find somebody to love.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It was the death of Humbert Balsan, the original producer of young French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Lves first film, Tout Est Pardone, that inspired the character of Grgoire Canvel (Louis-Do de Lencquesaing), a handsome and cultured Parisian film producer with a beautiful wife (Chiara Caselli), three young children, an apartment in the city and a house in the country. <br />The superficial order and enviable comfort of Grgoires home life contrasts with the chaos of his film company, Moon Films, a struggling and passionate outfit where theres not enough money in the bank or time in the day to satisfy the interests of both the arthouse filmmakers they produce and a growing list of creditors.<br />Theres a sadness at the core of Hansen-Lves impressive and moving second film, but it feels wrong to call it a tragedy, so gentle is her humanism and so light is her touch as a storyteller, both of which recall Eric Rohmers non-period films. The story involves a number of surprising, emotional twists (some too important to reveal), but the 29-year-old directors brisk and breezy style is to avoid the melodramatic and move on, while planting feelings in our minds to consider at our leisure. <br />Its a method familiar from her first film, in which she moved freely between characters in one family and was interested in their secrets and the bonds between a teenage girl and her parents. Here, her insistence on giving as much attention to the filmmaking process as emotions feels awkward at points, but the essence of the film is a welcome compassion and curiosity about inner lives.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Playing like one of Steven Berkoffs theatrical pastiches of East End gangsterdom  with cod-Pinteresque cadences replacing Shakespeares  this profane, pretentious and seriously unfunny ordeal thriller reunites the writing team (Louis Mellis, David Scinto) and some of the stars (Ray Winstone, Ian McShane) of the far superior Sexy Beast. <br />A deliberately ambiguous opening  a slow pan around the devastated flat of supine villain Colin Diamond (Winstone) to the strains of Harry Nilssons Without You  is followed by the initially unexplained abduction of a young French waiter (Melvil Poupaud) from a Chelsea restaurant. The victim is then locked up in a wardrobe in an abandoned East End warehouse by a motley crew of caricatured hardmen  Diamonds geezers!  consisting of mothers boy Archie (Tom Wilkinson), confident, black-shirted gay Meredith (McShane), semi-psychopathic Mal (Stephen Dillane) and the viciously unreconstructed Old Man Peanut (John Hurt). <br />The stage is set  and what a claustrophobic, theatrical, two-room stage it is  for a day of taunting, vicious banter as the traumatised, volatile and hallucinatingly drunk Diamond arrives and his pals encourage him to exact fatal revenge on lover boy for, as flashbacks and dialogue reveal, his wifes (Joanne Whalley) infidelity. <br />Aiming for black comedy and a redemptive satire on self-deluding male machismo, ham fisted debut director Malcolm Venville instead gives his cast enough rope to hang themselves rather than the characters they play, with the exceptions of poor Poupaud, an almost wordless skeleton in a cupboard, and the unfortunate Winstone, who graces what is otherwise a deeply unedifying movie with one of the most raw, deeply felt but wasted performances of his career.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The journey from boyhood to manhood has inspired more great British films than just about any other topic, from David Leans Great Expectations through to Shane Meadowss Room for Romeo Brass, This Is England and Somers Town. The star of those last two, pug-faced Grimsby troublemaker Thomas Turgoose, returns in this bold debut by noted shorts director Tom Harper (Cubs): a film which manages to shed new light on this well-documented chapter in the human story.<br />Turgoose plays David, a taciturn teen whose life in a drab Norfolk caravan park is brightened by his friendship with mouthy, independent scrapper Emily (Holly Grainger). When her parents threaten to split them up, Holly takes drastic action and fakes her disappearance, hiding out in a nearby cave and choosing David as her only link with the outside world. But as their companionship develops  in Davids mind, at least  into something more serious, his emotional state becomes increasingly unstable.<br />Harper and screenwriter Jack Thornes triumph in The Scouting Book for Boys is to nail adolescent romantic obsession: that feeling of swooning desperation that comes with unrequited love. This is a film dripping with nostalgia  not the cheap, wistful kind, more a heartfelt but unsentimental longing for the moral clarity and emotional intensity of childhood, however painful it might have been at the time.<br />Fish Tank cinematographer Robbie Ryan repeats the remarkable trick he pulled off in that film by being simultaneously realistic and poetic, drenching the jagged contours and concrete structures of the English coastline in warm, honeyed light. The soundtrack is less succesful: Harpers largely acoustic song choices err towards the winsome  and occasionally the downright awful  which punctures the meticulously sustained, sun-kissed mood.<br />But a film about teenagers stands or falls on its performances, and here The Scouting Book for Boys succeeds admirably. Turgoose executes his customary balancing act between naturalism and outright performance, and its becoming increasingly hard to see the joins: his turn here is far more downbeat and restrained than were used to. Grainger is magnificent as Emily, switching from cold disdain to grasping helplessness in an eyeblink. Their relationship is beautifully developed and wholly believable.<br />Thorne and Harper take a series of perilous narrative risks in the final act, the perceived success or failure of which will depend on an audiences willingness to follow them into some surprisingly dark and challenging emotional territory. But even if some of his choices fail to convince completely, Harper has done enough with this striking, ambitious debut to herald the arrival of a major new filmmaking talent.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[David Bowerss fond retooling of Astro Boy, the seminal boy-bot creation of late Manga godhead Osamu Tezuka, is about as innocuous as family toons get. Set in the floating future world of Metro City, its the story of a young boy (Freddie Highmore) accidentally vaporised in an industrial accident, only to be rebuilt as a miniature robot gunship by his scientist father (Nicolas Cage). Donald Sutherland lends his voice to ultra-right-wing demagogue President Stone, who lusts for state-of-the-art firepower while spouting militarist buzzwords and allowing the audience to ally with the now-shunned Astro Boy and his new cadre of plucky outcasts. While far from an unmitigated disaster, Bowerss play-it-straight attitude towards the material combined with the crisp, if unspectacular, animation doesnt allow Astro Boy a moment to bob its head above the ever-swelling digimation pack. Though it may pass muster with the very wee ones.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The bands in Iranian director Bahman Ghobadis deceptively ramshackle snapshot of Tehrans underground music scene joke about the blood-drinking and devil worship of which theyre often accused. Which is funny, because these Converse kids look like they were raised on a steady diet of Dave Eggers and Devendra Banhart, not Satan and haemoglobin. Persian Cats is not a documentary but Ghobadi has said the script is 90 per cent real life and his actor/musicians seem pretty much to be playing themselves. Among them are Ashkan (Ashkan Koshanejad) and Negar (Negar Shaghaghi), a couple just out of prison and putting together an indie band to take to London.<br />All non-religious music is illegal in Iran, so its a crepuscular world of basement cellars into which the jittery camera follows them. Negar and Ashkan hook up with Nader, a wheeler-dealer (played hilariously Hamed Behdad), who promises to procure black market passports. He also takes them  and us  on a tour of Tehrans musicians, from Farsi rappers to traditional vocalists, to find band mates. There are some brilliantly funny scenes: a farmer moans that the metal band practising in a cowshed is putting his heifers off milking. There are some lovely murmurs too of the graceful expressiveness for which Ghobadi (Turtles Can Fly) is known: a gentle guitar teacher plays to a classroom of rapt five year olds. A few have criticised the music for being patchy, which it is. But thats mealy-mouthed considering the bravery and resistance of the musicians. The personal cost is realised in a sudden spasm of violence at the end, making this a full-throated plea for civil liberties. Incidentally, Ghobadi and his two leads have since had to leave Iran.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[This debut from young Aboriginal Australian director Warwick Thornton, a cinematographer and veteran of short films and documentaries, is a near-silent, sun-bleached love story that plays out delicately between two teens living in a rundown community in the Australian desert. Barely a word is spoken between disaffected, petrol-sniffing Samson (Rowan McNamara) and wary, more sensible Delilah (Marissa Gibson) from start to finish; they communicate almost solely in looks and gestures. At first, its Samson who does all the chasing, but when Delilahs grandma (Mitjili Gibson) dies and the community blames her, she seeks companionship with Samson, who himself has fallen out violently with his brother. Together they steal a car and head to town, where they end up indulging in a worsening solvent habit that threatens to ruin their lives entirely.<br />Thornton is brilliant at capturing the isolation that marks these kids lives and inviting us into their bubble, a place where we come to see tenderness behind rough exteriors and understand the prejudices they face. The director plays a clever game with sympathy: he brings us closer and closer to Samson and Delilah but doesnt demand that we feel sorry for them. Its a smart approach that means we never feel manipulated, just guided by a sensitive and fearless commentator unafraid of revealing ugliness on all sides of the social divide  but who also believes that love can endure most hardships.]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[A Single Man]]></name>
      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[We tend to make a fuss of debutants. We celebrate their precocity. We excuse their naivety. But sometimes the word is misleading. Take Tom Ford. A Single Man is the 48 year olds first film, but can we really call a man who spent ten years as the creative director of Gucci a beginner? Couture is not cinema, but there are similarities. Both have a tendency to crush art with commerce. Both demand that an army of creatives  art directors, production designers, photographers and the rest  unite behind a vision that is sold ruthlessly to the public. So its worth remembering that Fords toolbag was already full to brimming when he embarked on his first film  though whether or not he knew how to use those tools is another thing entirely.<br />Christopher Isherwoods short 1964 novel A Single Man is a superb choice for a concise, intimate film. Its events are few, its emotional power is cumulative. The book visits one day in the life of George, a gay British expat and middle-aged literature teacher in 1962 Los Angeles. We learn gradually that George lost his younger partner, Jim, in a car crash and discover much later that this is a significant day for George, a slow reveal that gives the text a random, quotidian quality.<br />Ford turns the book on its head so that we know both these things from the start. But other than that, the books interior nature and sense of wandering remain in Fords delicate, moving film. We follow George (Colin Firth) closely, often alone, from morning to night. We watch as he gives a lesson on Aldous Huxley and join him on a drunken evening at the home of his soulmate and compatriot, Charlotte (Julianne Moore). Later, were with him during a late-night flirtation with a pupil, Kenny (Nicholas Hoult). And, in flashback, we see snapshots of his earlier, happier life with Jim (Matthew Goode).<br />As a director, Ford manages to exude both extreme confidence and first-time nerves. Only a beginner would decide that the best way to add structure to a near-perfect story is to insert a gun from almost the very first scene. But the control and precision with which Ford tells his story helps us to ignore this choice and still trust his vision, which falls off the screen with an intoxicating fluidity, helped by evocative editing of sound and image and an increasingly affecting score by Abel Korzeniowski. The film looks gorgeous. Young Spanish DoP Eduard Gran, a graduate of the National Film and Television School, shoots on an old 35mm stock that gives the images a soft precision. Almost all the film is colour, but the colours tell a story themselves: Ford manipulates the films brightness so that it glows and darkens depending on Georges mood. Rather than coming across as a gimmick, this serves the emotional ebb and flow of the book well and helps to turn the literary into the cinematic.<br />Maybe the film is too pristine. In this world, dust doesnt land, paint doesnt peel and grass doesnt grow. Georges black-and-white suit-and-tie combo is too perfect and his house is a modernist dream. His partner was an architect, were told. His director is a fashion designer, were thinking.<br />But nothing distracts from the empathy and understanding we have for George, and on that the film must live or die. Firths portrayal of a man repressing his grief while being unable to repress his instinct for love and for life is excellent and moving, while Fords balancing of depth and surface is precarious but ultimately winning. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>In our contemporary society, youth are pretty much lost, a musician says in<i> Until the Light Takes Us, </i>an exploration of Norways storied black-metal scene of the 1990s. People are telling them what to do, but the youth have an instinct telling them, This is wrong. Fair enough: Rebellion and boredom have long inspired potent rock. But the speakerVarg Vikernes, mastermind of seminal black-metal act Burzummakes his point from jail, where hes serving time for murdering a bandmate.</p><p>Largely forgoing the sensationalism of Michael Moynihans seminal black-metal tome, <i>Lords of Chaos</i> (look for a screen adaptation in 2010), Aaron Aites and Audrey Ewells plainspoken music doc relies on firsthand testimony from band members and key observers. Meanwhile, images of blazing churches and lurid tabloid headlines show how isolation and affected melancholy led to heinous crimes perpetrated by black-metal musicians, and on to a media-fueled frenzy.In addition to the unsettlingly charismatic Vikernes, Aites and Ewell focus on Darkthrone drummer Fenriz (Gylve Nagell), a diligent craftsman whose ghoulish pallor amounts to a blue collar. A big part of me wishes that this whole thing didnt turn into a trendthats what fucking sucked, and sucks still, Nagell says. Then again, wellpeople like to dress up.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>An Internet sensation since 2002, blogger and self-professed asshole Tucker Max has built a cottage industry documenting his drunken sexual conquests with women he has slightly less contempt for than those who dont succumb to his charms. With a dose of faux self-loathing and technicolorful epithets for the opposite sex, Max masks his misogyny by claiming hes a feminist, arguing that women have as much a right to screw whomever they choose. Hating him is part of the shtick, naturally, and his clever critic-proofing isnt lost on the producers of this painfully unfunny adaptation of Maxs online missives.</p><p>Beginning with the stalest of premisesthree buds and a bachelor partydirector Bob Gosse attempts to cash in on the vulgar bromance craze. But whereas the calculated narcissism of Tuckers onscreen alter ego (Czuchry) is an effective tool on his inebriated targets, such bad behavior will tax your tolerance level after five minutes. When the movie adds two sidekicks (Bradford, Stults) as comic-relief foils to Tuckers shenanigans, the toxicity simply triples. Worse, an attempt at redeeming itself with an all-it-takes-is-an-apology scene (noticeably absent from Maxs prose) leaves behind an even fouler stench than the films big fecal comic set piece.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Whip It is essentially Rollerball for the American Apparel set, where instead of James Caan battling fascist corporate powers youve got Ellen Page taking arms against crass feminine stereotypes. With her seductive and lightly anarchic directorial debut, Drew Barrymore strongarms her way into Austins underground roller-derby scene to tell the familiar tale of an underdogs rise to sporting eminence. The sport itself makes little sense to the casual onlooker (its female-only, full-contact and involves charging around an oval-shaped roller rink on skates and looking mean), but the film is saved by the sincerity of its tone and the richness and variety of its ensemble cast  from Juliette Lewiss hotshot banshee Iron Maven to Kristen Wiigs nurturing Maggie Mayhem and Barrymores borderline psychotic Smashley Simpson. And deftly moderating her patented eye-rolling poseur shtick, Page delivers her most charismatic and least divisive performance to date as Bliss Cavendar, aka Babe Ruthless.<br />Taken as a florid celebration of female solidarity, the film is commendable, if hardly radical. But in the final reel, following a sappy my-first-boyfriend subplot and much indie- rock name-dropping, the focus shifts to examine Blisss increasingly fractured relationship with her fusty parents and a more discerning and emotionally substantial film emerges. Marcia Gay Harden, as Blisss ex-beauty-queen mother, shimmers in the background, desperate for her daughter to realise her potential, but also quietly devastated at the prospect of losing her to the big bad world. Its a much needed oasis of quiet heartbreak amid the exhilarating cavalcade of sweaty roller girls.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ordinary-looking, middle-aged Krister (Olle Sarri) wakes on the bathroom floor, spattered with blood. He washes, dresses and goes to work. Hes irritable, out of sorts, yelling at his clients. The world around him is vague but intrusive  the lights too bright, the noise too loud. He goes to the gym, then drives home. The living room looks like a slaughterhouse.<br /><br />Jesper Ganslandts third feature is a work of psychological observation in the most literal sense: all we can do is watch. Theres no commentary, no judgment and precious little insight, so what were left with is a simple, near-real-time portrait of a taciturn, unreadable man trying to deal with the extremity of his existence. Sarri is phenomenal as Krister, an icy, utterly unpredictable blank canvas. Ganslandt directs with tremendous precision, creating a mood of brooding, implacable threat. But his refusal to dig any deeper into his character results in a compelling but finally (and perhaps intentionally) rather shallow portrait of human behaviour.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Austrian director Jessica Hausner, once a pupil of Michael Haneke (and credited on imdb.com, not very flatteringly, as script girl on Funny Games), takes her cameras to the French Pyrenean pilgrimage site of Lourdes for her third film, a mysterious, French-language ensemble piece about the role of miracles in the modern world. Hausners focus is on a youngish French woman, Christine (Sylvie Testud), one of a large group of pilgrims being shepherded around by Lourdess Order of Malta volunteers, a gang of young helpers dressed like fascists moonlighting as members of the St John Ambulance. But Hausner is wary of focusing too much on Christine, preferring to give equal billing to Lourdes itself and her wider group of pilgrims.<br /><br />The characters are scripted, but the places are real, and part of the films thrill, especially when coupled with Hausners often inscrutable attitude towards the place, is to watch her drama unfolding in such a location, both creepy and magical, dour and uplifting. Hausner has been given a privilege and she uses it wisely.<br /><br />Gradually, though, the drama tightens around Christine, whom we observe at closer quarters than the others. She is frail, pretty and blonde; shes also living with multiple sclerosis and is unable to move her body below the neck. Christines religious beliefs are unclear (I prefer the cultural trips, she says) but the pilgrimage is having a strange effect on her and soon shes the focus of everyones attention. Are we witnessing a miracle? Is Christine manipulating the situation? Is she really ill? And are we cruel even to entertain that last thought?<br />The beauty of Hausners film is that just when you think shes going to take a sneering swipe at Lourdes, its tacky trinkets and deluded visitors, the film takes a much less easy  and more inquiring  turn. Like Haneke, Hausner is more comfortable opening a debate than closing it. Some things are clear, though. Her photography is exquisite, evoking religious icons, and her mastery of directing such a group of actors at this exceptional location allows the film to maintain a strong ensemble feel while never losing sight of the mysterious story at its core. Theres also a delicious streak of black humour that runs through the film and stops it from becoming too pious or maudlin. The result is a provocative and surprising pleasure that may persuade even the most hardened rationalists to reconsider what religion means as a sanctity to those who have few other choices in life.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Big things were expected of German director Hans-Christian Schmid after he wowed critics in 2006 with astonishing demonic possession drama Requiem. Sadly, hes chosen to abandon much of what was great about that movie  the bracing, close-quarters photography, a virtuoso central performance  for this robust if inessential follow-up, a Euro-hopping legal thriller far more concerned with the legal than the thriller. Kerry Fox slinks into the role of a hard-nosed senior prosecutor out to bring a criminal Serbian general to justice. After a key witness commits suicide, his sister (played by Anamaria Marincas from 4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days) agrees to share her experience of the atrocities to a tribunal at the Hague. Storm is best when examining the emotional toil of the legal process, with Schmid and writing partner Bernd Lange offering a satisfyingly humane spin to the old story of moral obligation versus personal safety. The functional direction complements the austere material, but you cant help feeling the story needed something a little extra.]]></review>

It uses the 1960s films and TV shows of Alfred Hitchcock as a starting point to explore the relationship between the Cold War and the big and small screens, between reality and fear, especially relating to American identity in the 1960s but with some nods to the present. The theme of doubles runs throughout: we meet a current Hitch lookalike and watch as Khrushchev squares up to Nixon. Theres also humour, not least in the chauvinist coffee ads which Grimonperez quotes, which helps to soften the rapid blow of ideas, some of which are clearer on a first viewing than others.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Mira Nairs biopic of legendary aviatrix Amelia Earhart (Hilary Swank, below) arrives on these shores the victim of a rather comprehensive kicking from the American critics, and its easy to see why. The film is hokey, wide-eyed and at times laughably unconvincing  and as such is an entirely fitting heir to the 30s Hollywood movies its clearly attempting to imitate. Not for Nair the fashionable, cynical revisionism of recent times: this is unashamed hagiography, a knowingly old-fashioned celebration of a heroic life.<br />Battling beneath the weight of a haystack haircut and the most terrifying gnashers this side of Jaws: The Revenge, Swank makes a decent fist of the title role, all brittle consonants and steely self-determination. In a surprising but highly appropriate upset, its Richard Gere and Ewan McGregor who take the thankless arm-candy roles, as book-tycoon hubby George Putnam and gadabout bit-on-the-side Gene Vidal, respectively. <br />The script, framed in a series of flashbacks as Amelia embarks on her doomed round-the-world flight, takes our heroine from plucky but inexperienced amateur pilot to icon of the Great Depression. Its a fascinating story, told simply but effectively: no ones working outside their comfort zone, but the film is never less than watchable and is often highly entertaining. Nair constructs the aerial sequences with real grace, and the entire enterprise has a lightness of touch that precludes any deep emotional involvement but also enables proceedings to tick along quite pleasurably. Inoffensive, arcane and ultimately rather sweet, Amelia is one to take your grandmother to.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When illness causes his mother (Brenda Blethyn) to need a wheelchair, doting con Nick Kane (Tamer Hassan) goes straight, opening a travel agency with a 100,000 loan from sinister gangster, Mr Thigo (50 Cent). But when the credit crunch bites, mean-spirited Mr Thigo calls in his loan and gives Nick 24 hours to pay  or his mum gets it. With best mate Bing (Danny Dyer) in tow, Nick first tries to raise the readies legally but soon slips back into his old ways of intimidation and violence.<br />Partly financed by footballers Rio Ferdinand and Ashley Cole, this budget-conscious, simplistically plotted and often cringingly performed crime caper is not quite as inauspicious a producing debut as one might have expected. Granted, its message is contradictory  on one hand it drums home the old crime doesnt pay adage, while on the other it demonstrates exactly the opposite  but its lighthearted, comic tone proves relatively genial. And Blethyns a right laugh as the gaga mum with a mite more gumption than first meets the eye.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Theres a line from Jurassic Park that echoed hauntingly through this critics head as Avatar unfolded: Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they <i>could</i>, they didnt stop to think if they <i>should</i>. James Cameron is one of those scientists: so in love with the technology, with the possibilities, that he never pauses to reflect upon the practicalities of cinema, of storytelling, of connecting with an audience.<br />That quote is doubly relevant when one considers the cultural similarities between these two blockbusters, both of which justified massive expense by promising a quantum leap forward in visual effects. But where Spielberg utilised technology in the service of a tight, witty script, Cameron is simply out to astound. There are moments when you almost expect Sam Worthingtons moody, ever-present voiceover to be replaced by the self-styled king of the world yelling at his audience: Are you awestruck now? How about now? Now?<br />When his scientist brother is killed a week before shipping out to the distant planet Pandora, wheelchair-bound US Marine Jake Sully (Worthington) is offered the chance to go in his place. On Pandora, Jake meets his avatar, a remote-controlled host body generated from his brothers DNA and designed to blend in among the native Navi, a race of nine-foot blue hunter-gatherers living in peaceful harmony with their homeworld, Native American style.<br />Or rather, Native Californian: Navi civilisation is a mishmash of half-formed Hollywood ideas about the supposed superiority of primitive cultures, tossing around buzzwords like spirit and energy without ever approaching a cohesive set of beliefs. But all this tree-hugging shit, as Jake describes it, is only the most obvious defect in Camerons dire, clich-ridden script. From the bluntly expositional nature of the early scenes to the gung-ho, sub-Aliens banter of Jakes fellow soldiers, this is screenwriting on autopilot, cobbling together unripe ideas without a scrap of originality or emotional resonance. <br />Its hard to fault Avatar as an immersive visual experience. Pandora and its luridly coloured inhabitants are beautifully designed, though none of this ever feels remotely real. But this was  supposed to be the movie that changed the face of filmmaking forever. Ultimately, Camerons signature achievement may have been to prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the oldest of all Hollywood maxims: all the money in the world is no subsitute for fresh ideas and a solid script.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[We first meet Zac Efrons Richard, the me of Richard Linklaters charming new film about the insecurities and comradeship of actors, as a distracted, 17-year-old New York student, reading Nol Coward in class instead of Shakespeare. Its 1937 and Richard is a mildly cocky, slightly vain youngster who compares himself to a photo of John Gielgud on a book cover and tells a girl he meets in a jazz store that Im sort of an actor. Minutes later, he stumbles on some real actors gathered to rehearse Orson Welless Mercury Theatre production of Julius Caesar and lays down some chat about playing the ukulele. Next thing, hes got a bit part. Weekly pay: zilch. Kids got balls, mutters Welles (Christian McKay), a cigar between his teeth. Let rehearsals begin<br />Robert Kaplows source novel and Linklaters sprightly adaptation sprinkle a little fiction on Welless very real, radical staging of Julius Caesar and offer a sideways view of one of the most precocious, flawed talents of the twentieth century. In 1937, Welles was just 22, pre-War of the Worlds, pre-Citizen Kane, but already a darling of the New York theatre scene and able to wrest art from chaos on a wing and a prayer. Efrons Richard  played with an attractive, puckish energy and loosely based on a real character  is a window on Welless world at just enough of a distance from the great man that the directors loud personality doesnt dominate. All roads lead to Welles, but we also witness a brief affair between Richard and Mercury staffer Sonja Jones (Claire Danes), during which Richard learns that the public and the private are one and the same in this theatrical hothouse. Even the loss of his virginity infringes on Welless mantra: There is one simple rule: I own the store!<br />McKays turn as Welles is hugely enjoyable, the right mix of extreme confidence and a dash of vulnerability. Physically and vocally, hes very convincing: his Welles is a bullish presence among his actors but he also displays cracks in the great mans armour: he whispers a sincere thank you to his producer (Eddie Marsan) and tells Richard how hes adapting The Magnificent Ambersons for radio: Ambersons is about how everything gets taken away from you, he says, a reminder that Welles lost both parents by the time he was 15. <br />Whats most admirable about Linklaters production is that it never loses sight of the play at its heart. The crescendo is not a romance or any other distraction, but the outcome of rehearsals during which we and the cast believe a disaster is pending. Theres a strong ensemble flavour, characterised by the simultaneously selfish and clubbable tendencies of the actors, which makes for a lightly comic experience but also for a portrait of a theatre company that feels warm and true.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When astronaut Chuck Baker lands on Planet 51, hes shocked to discover its inhabited by green locust-like people who live in futuristic homes as envisaged by sci-fi writers of the 1950s. Fearing an invasion of post-Columbus proportions, the locals call on arrogant General Crawl to amass his anti-alien brigade. Only one character, a kid called Lom , is prepared to help Chuck evade capture. Planet 51 posits notions of colonialism, cultural division and xenophobia to unremarkable effect. Its also one hell of a magpie movie  thats to say it comes over as a mix of ideas, characters, designs and scenes that recall Shrek (hardly surprising given that the film is penned by Shrek writer Joe Stillman), The Cat in the Hat, Toy Story, Alien, Star Wars and ET. This below-par sci-fi animation is no threat to the similarly themed and infinitely superior Battle for Terra (released February 12), but theres enough of a storyline here to keep younger space cadets moderately settled.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In this three-dimensional, computer-generated age, new studio chief John Lasseters desire to take Disney animation back to basics seems a risky proposition. But whats surprising about The Princess and the Frog is just how far back theyve gone: this isnt The Lion King or even The Jungle Book: with its sensuous, hand-drawn animation, soft pastel palette and jazz-age setting, this is an exercise in retro recreation as rigorous and rewarding as Far from Heaven.<br /> The plot is thin but fun, following the adventures of a poor New Orleans waitress with big dreams and a haughty prince of indeterminate foreign stock after theyre transformed into amphibians and marooned in the Louisiana bayou. Randy Newmans songs are a little too blandly Randy Newman-ish and the story is uneven, but there are some great characters, some even better jokes, a general sense of good humour and that entrancing, eye-ravishing old-school animation.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its a true story: rich southern white folks take in a black teenager, then help him towards college football and a big-time NFL contract. In the right hands, this could be about simple kindness overcoming mutual suspicion and bridging social divides  a story questioning an America where it takes such charity to effect genuine social mobility. This is certainly not that movie. Instead it resembles one of those formatted TV reality shows where the top-billed female personality uses her bossy common sense to tame recalcitrant kiddies/ animals so their parents/owners can be proud of them.<br /><br />Quite how Sandra Bullock deserved an Oscar for her one-note turn as bleached supermum Leigh-Anne is a mystery, since it transforms a potentially worthwhile character study into a grandstanding star vehicle. Her comic timing is just-so and she invests the homespun one-liners with a veneer of sincerity, but theres no way this is a real person. Its Sandra Bullock doing her thing.<br />On the other hand, Michael (Quinton Aaron), the troubled outcast to whom she gives a stable home the rest of her family know better than to argue with Leigh-Anne  is hard to read, beyond gentle giant cultural clichs. Meanwhile, director John Hancock shows us enough of the lads scary, hope-free ghetto background to tell us we dont want to go there. He lends the proceedings a patina of class and a certain entertainment value, yet the whole approach (in marked contrast to, say, Precious) is about putting white middle-class compassion proudly centre-stage. A half-truth, a half-story, surely?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Taking into account films like Patch Adams, RV and License to Wed, Robin Williamss acting CV now has more bizarre blotches on it than an abstract expressionist canvas. Even so, Old Dogs is a special kind of bad. Here he plays a vile corporate shitbag who is charged with the unspeakable task of caring for his own children (the result of a drunken fling in Miami) for two whole weeks. With John Travolta worming in as his long-time business partner and best bud, this wanton set-up exists solely as an excuse for a lame-brained cavalcade of feebly executed, deeply unfunny and casually offensive skits in which the two prance around, wave their hands in the air and make asses out of themselves. Its hard to pinpoint the exact nadir. Perhaps its when Travolta starts shovelling rhubarb pie over his face? Or what about when the pair unwittingly wander into the silverback enclosure at a zoo? Or maybe its when Williams is trapped in a tanning booth and then gets mistaken for an Asian man? Whatever, this is imbecilic hooey of the rarest breed.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Given that Alvin and chums originally started out in 1958 as a trio of high-pitched recording artists, its only right that this live-action squeakquel should begin with the furry little CG blighters wooing a concert crowd with a raucous Kinks cover. Unfortunately, its the films only highlight  if the sight of three annoying furballs murdering You Really Got Me can be considered a highlight.<br />Id like to think the filmmakers had a lengthy deliberation about a storyline, but I suspect they simply caught an episode of The X Factor and the recently released Bandslam and thought a premise involving a self-centred Alvin, a rival group of female chipmunks (The Chipettes) and a college talent contest would prove a mighty good wheeze. And, indeed, that might have been the case had the story any semblance of a story. Instead, what were offered is a succession of lifeless scenes punctuated by pratfalls that only a handful of kids in the audience found funny. Next.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Russia, 1910. In his old age, Leo Tolstoy has become so famous worldwide that the merest hint hes about to pop his clogs sends newsreel cameras gathering in anticipation. The real story though, as this slightly fusty drama elaborates, is unfolding inside the Tolstoy household, where the octogenerian writer (Christopher Plummer, authentically beardy) finds himself in the centre of a dispute over the valuable publishing rights to War and Peace. The Tolstoyan political movement  an organisation espousing his ideas on communal property to combat social injustice  sense a major funding opportunity should Tolstoy sign his best-known book over to their leader Chertkov (Paul Giamatti), yet Tolstoys aristocratic wife Sofya (Helen Mirren), having delivered him 13 children, is determined to fight her corner to the bitter end.<br />Idealism versus family ties makes for a potentially juicy set-to, yet its the historical detail which keeps this adaptation of Jay Parinis novel relatively intriguing, rather than merely stodgy. Writer-director Michael Hoffman is all reverence towards Tolstoy himself, but curiously supercilious towards the beliefs of the Tolstoyan movement, thus undermining the key subplot (eager young acolyte James McAvoy gets his dream job as the great mans secretary, but must also spy on him) and unfairly loading the central conflict in favour of ferocious spouse Mirren. Her impressively projected performance becomes the dominating factor, causing Plummer to overdo it, and sidelining both the earnestly wet McAvoy and moustache-twirling Giamatti. Engaging performers all, but the movies superficial flummery is slightly exasperating when the true-life events would have provided an even richer palette of ideas.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[He turns 80 this year and claims Gran Torino was his last outing as an actor. But, as a director, Clint Eastwood is keeping his nose to the grindstone. He spent the end of 2009 filming a Peter Morgan-penned thriller, Hereafter, in Europe and the US, and earlier last year decamped to South Africa to film this respectful, rousing drama about Nelson Mandelas canny co-opting of the 1995 Rubgy World Cup Finals as a tool to promote racial harmony across the social and political tinderbox that was the new, post-apartheid state.<br /><br />Eastwood isnt a director to indulge in shades of grey and so the films first scenes of the historic, televised release of Mandela (Morgan Freeman) from prison in 1990 are preceded by a shot of white boys playing rugby on one side of the road while their black equivalents kick a football on the other. Simple imagery: a background of division established  job done.<br />A similar, no-nonsense efficiency colours the whole film, which jumps forward to Mandelas inauguration in 1994, again mixing reconstruction and news footage, before ditching this early documentary feel to settle into a behind-the-scenes walk-through of the early months of his presidency. This was a time when existing presidential staff wrongly expected to be booted out of their jobs; a black civil-rights group believed, also wrongly, that Mandela would support their desire to change the name and colours of the national rugby team; and somewhere in a white suburb the captain of that same team, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) and his family were shaking their heads at the assumption that their country was heading to the dogs.<br />Eastwood and writer Anthony Peckham further stress South Africas lingering disharmony through a chorus of Mandelas bodyguards, for which existing, white heavies are joined by new, black counterparts. Between them, they trade insults and glares like boxers before a fight. Again, its a simple tool, useful enough but marred by some substandard local actors. All praise to Eastwood for casting on the ground; less praise to him for allowing them to disrupt his movie with their awkward presence.<br />From here, its valuable life lessons all round as Mandela invites Pienaar to tea, joins the rugby team in training and  famously  strides on to the pitch at the South Africa v New Zealand final wearing the same Springboks shirt that a year earlier was a divisive symbol of the old nation. Security tensions at this match offer Eastwood an unnecessary sideshow as he tries and fails to insert a thriller element into the film by hinting at a bomb attack or assassination attempt  real fears at the time, but out of place here. A shot of an aircraft flying above the stadium plays on post-9/11 fears  but would anyone in 1995 have suspected a low-flying passenger plane of terrorism?<br />Both leads are effective, and Damon is very good at displaying Pienaars conservatism cracking in the glare of Mandelas wise optimism. Freeman is perhaps too stately, but its a thankless task trying to pull off an impersonation of such a public figure. Hes more at ease in intimate scenes, although on a technical level, his accent raises the odd eyebrow.<br />Invictus isnt one of Eastwoods best films, especially judged against the late flowering of his career since 2003s Mystic River. But its still a noble and compassionate work that in its later scenes manages successfully to invest our emotions in the triumph of an important  if overlong!  sporting victory. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[City slickers find themselves marooned in Hicksville USA in this ultra-mild frolic which follows the fish-out-of-water comedy formula so closely its lack of surprise is almost, well, surprising. The Morgans are boutique estate agent Meryl (Sarah Jessica Parker) and swanky expat English lawyer Paul (Hugh Grant) and their marriage is in trouble  fertility issues, infidelity (his) and so on. However, as plot contrivance would have it, on their night out to patch things up, they see one of her wealthy clients being bumped off, and soon, to protect them from the killer at large, they find themselves spirited away to darkest Wyoming. Together  gulp! Without their mobiles  horror!<br />Were supposed to care whether they do actually remain together, but there are distractions, like wondering whether SJPs somewhat amorphous skin tone means shes actually been replaced by a CGI avatar of herself. Or quite why Grant, who hustles awfully hard with material youd hardly call fluff, keeps working with writer-director Marc Lawrence  he who brought us Two Weeks Notice and Music &amp; Lyrics, the celluloid equivalent of microwaveable ready meals. Theres a kind of functional professionalism which keeps things burbling along painlessly enough, but its an experience more fitting to a flu-ish afternoon on the sofa or long-haul in economy, when were at our least demanding. Rootin, tootin cowboy folk Sam Elliott and Mary Steenburgen add some downhome charm, but from the moment we see posters warning of grizzly attacks in the area, a rampaging bear cant arrive soon enough.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Older people have sex too! Thats the message of Its Complicated, the second geronto-com from Nancy Meyers. While 2003s Somethings Gotta Give featured an angsty, flustered Diane Keaton and a womanising Jack Nicholson, this stars a slightly less angsty Meryl Streep, who is flustered by her encounter with serial womaniser Alec Baldwin.<br />The complication is that Jane (Streep) was married to Jake (Baldwin)  but he left her and their kids for other woman Agness (Lake Bell). Now Jakes on a nostalgia trip, sweet-talking his independent ex into bed and a whole world of confusion. This may sound like unforgivably caddish behaviour, but script and actor conspire to make Jake an attractive proposition, with Baldwins charismatic arrogance and playful banter in full effect. <br />Baldwin has terrific chemistry with Streep: the pair seem to be having a genuinely hilarious time getting drunk and naked together  not that Jane will do that with the lights on. The script explores female insecurities and doesnt shy away from the realities of middle-aged sex: Jake proudly displays his hairy beer belly on several occasions.<br />You could watch this pair run around having a slapstick secret affair for hours. Unfortunately, Steve Martin has to poke his head in as the Sensible Alternative, and hes miscast. Martin is fine in comic scenes, but as a romantic possibility hes unappealing. The inevitable conflict between the two men takes the film into more humdrum, sentimental territory, not helped by periodic appearances from Janes soppy grown-up children. Still, Streep is as enjoyable as ever, and if laughs count for anything, this is one of the better romantic comedies of the season.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its surely no coincidence that when Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), the comic-book-reading New York teenager who decides to buy a coloured wetsuit and become the superhero of the title, winds up in hospital after his first outing as a vigilante, he reads Watchmen. Like that story, the series by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr, on which Kick-Ass is based is a comic about comics, presuming a substantial knowledge of the icons and conventions of the superhero genre. Its an index of how successfully that genre has established itself in the Hollywood mainstream over the past decade that such postmodern, self-referential fare is now deemed apt fodder for major studio releases.<br /><br />Puzzled that no one has ever tried to put comic-book theory into practice, Dave hits the streets in the name of righteousness, overcoming early setbacks to achieve hero status with a little help from MySpace and YouTube. He also attracts the attention of father-and-daughter vigilante team Big Daddy and Hit Girl (Nicolas Cage and Chlo Moretz) and arouses the enmity of crime lord Frank DAmico (Mark Strong), whose son (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) sees a chance to dabble in the hero game himself.<br />Director Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Stardust) directs with efficiency and a good sense of action while Johnson puts in an engaging turn that maintains sympathy and helps paper over some of the plots more jerky, episodic aspects. Wearing its sources on its Spandex sleeve, Kick-Ass fairly bulges with references to other comic-book movies, especially the Spider-Man and Batman franchises; Cages stilted delivery as the Dark Knightish Daddy is a nice touch. Theres some intriguing play around ideas of closetedness  a perennial concern of the genre  with Daves secret life leading classmates to presume hes gay. Other conventions are touched upon but left unexplored: while it is constructed around three father-child pairings, for instance, the film leaves Daves single dad a cipher.<br /><br />The bond between pre-teen Hit Girl and her Big Daddy, meanwhile, is as intense as it is outrageously violent, rooted in such affectionate larks as his shooting her at close range to familiarise her with the use of bullet-proof vests. The duo are responsible for many of the pictures numerous fatalities, shown in more detail and with more gusto than in most superhero films (or most 15-rated films, for that matter). The sight of Hit Girl slicing and dicing half a dozen thugs to the accompaniment of the Banana Splits theme tune locates Kick-Ass in the post-Tarantino landscape of hyperfictional ultraviolence. Any gestures at a version of realism or the pathos that might result from someone actually trying to be a superhero are lost in the wash.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[After a fine start to the decade with 24 Hour Party People, the British music film has become an increasingly drab prospect. Sanitised, reverential biopics like Control and Nowhere Boy have reduced our most vital rock legends to overanalysed everymen, robbing them of power and mystery in an effort to understand them  a pointless and impossible task best left to the cultural scholars.<br />But Road to Guantanamo director Mat Whitecross is having none of it. Tackling the rise and fall of bolshy proto-punk gobshite Ian Dury, Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll is a riot of clattering noise and kaleidoscopic colour, off-kilter imagery and foul language, all the good things the title promises and much more. Taking his cue not just from former collaborator Michael Winterbottoms celebrated Factory expos but from Todd Hayness ramshackle, revisionist rock n roll masterpieces, Velvet Goldmine and Im Not There, Whitecross presents Dury as a verbally abusive, dishonest, thoroughly disreputable but endlessly fascinating lyrical genius, exploring his past in a way that informs  but never seeks to explain  his present.<br />That present is the mid-70s, the period in which Dury (Andy Serkis) split from his old band Kilburn And The High Roads  and from long-suffering spouse Betty (Olivia Williams)  to form the Blockheads, with whom he would achieve stellar homegrown success. Taking up with teenage tearaway Denise (Naomie Harris), Dury attempts to juggle the demands of family, fame and mounting alcoholism, but always ends up putting his own needs first.<br />Its this refusal to sugarcoat Durys shortcomings that really impresses: yes, Whitecross and screenwriter Paul Viragh ask us to empathise with their self-pitying, class-obsessed, emotionally and physically crippled hero, but they never expect us to forgive his excesses. Serkiss performance is remarkable, alternating between Gollum-esque bug-eyed lunacy and a more subtle, heartfelt portrait of a life in turmoil. <br />A scene in which Dury revisits the hospital where he spent his childhood, coming face to face with a new generation of angry young outcasts, is quietly heartbreaking: sentimental, perhaps, but entirely schmaltz-free. Similarly, the central relationship between Dury and twitchy pre-teen son Baxter (a superb Bill Milner) does a great job of outlining the unpredictable lows and (often literal) highs of having a deadbeat pop star for a father. You dont need to be a fan of Durys music to enjoy Sex &amp; Drugs. This is just gorgeous, celebratory cinema, unfettered and courageous, if unashamedly scattershot, much like the man himself. Forget young Lennon and his tedious Oedipal angst  this is the one by which a new decade of music movies will be judged.]]></review>

Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Joshi) embark on a road trip to Ladakh, in the Himalayas, to track down long-lost buddy Rancho (Khan). The latter is introduced via lengthy flashbacks detailing the antics of the three idiots during their college engineering days. But why did Rancho disappear mysteriously after graduating? The films main strength lies in its ability to address head-on the possible failure of higher education in contemporary India. This is conveyed via Hiranis trademark light-hearted touch. Consequently, the clichd make your passion your profession premise never feels preachy. Overlong, this quirky well-acted film proves, as the title track says, that generally all is well with commercial Hindi cinema.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[Movies about country musicians tend to go one of two ways. First, there are those inspired by true events, films like Coal Miners Daughteror Walk the Line, which explore the rise of a legend: all one-room shacks, abusive parents and acres of gingham. Then there are stories inspired by the songs themselves: tales of hardship and loss, redemption and self-discovery, saloon bars, acoustic guitars and gallons of sippin whisky.<br />Crazy Heart falls squarely into the latter bunch. Jeff Bridges plays Bad Blake, a one-time Nashville big hitter reduced to touring Midwestern dives picking up loose change and loose women, his livelihood in even worse shape than his liver. That is, until two events conspire to turn his sinking ship around: a relationship with Maggie Gyllenhaals Jean promises the kind of unflinching affection and familial grounding Blake badly needs, and a gig writing songs for one-time protg-turned-megastar Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) provides a much-needed jolt for his career.<br />In purely story terms this is by-the-numbers stuff, ticking all the expected boxes about redemption and renewal. But writer-director Scott Coopers trick is to turn that predictability into a strength: like a song youve heard a thousand times but which never fails to tug the heartstrings, Crazy Heart feels familiar, even comforting, offering few surprises but a wealth of lovingly crafted, immaculately judged, wholly authentic emotion.<br />The emotion is there in the soundtrack put together by Cooper and producing legend T-Bone Burnett, with new songs by Burnett and Ryan Bingham sitting perfectly alongside obvious inspirations like Townes van Zandt and Waylon Jennings. Its also in Coopers solid direction: despite his inexperience, he never falls prey to flashy first-time director syndrome, confident that his screenplay and cast will carry him through.<br />And its in those remarkable central performances: Bridges has already earned an Oscar nomination, but its impossible to overstate how much his honest, unabashed performance  part The Dude, part Kris Kristofferson  grounds the film. Hes backed by a sympathetic Gyllenhaal, making magic from a potentially thankless role, and a convincing turn from Farrell as the preening bigshot in cowboy clothes. But best of all is Robert Duvall, who essentially defined the subgenre with Tender Mercies back in 1983, and whose quiet, deeply felt turn as a bar owner reminds us of his undimmed but underused talent.<br />A shame, then, that the movie falls at the final hurdle with a series of crude, convenient feelgood twists, leading to an abrupt, unconvincing finale. If Cooper and his cast hadnt done their work so well, hadnt made us care so deeply for these fractured souls, maybe it wouldnt matter. As it is, Crazy Heart is only two-thirds a great movie: but like the song says, that aint bad.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Tim Burtons part-live action, part-animated, all-3D version of Alice in Wonderland is a collage of characters and episodes from Lewis Carrolls two nineteenth-century books about a girl who falls into the rabbit hole of her own imagination. But purists beware: Burton and his writer, Disney regular Linda Woolverton (The Lion King), invent a quest narrative  Alice must slay the Jabberwocky!  that climaxes in a pedestrian battle for which Alice puts aside dresses and channels Joan of Arc. Moreover, our heroines loopy headtrip begins with her fleeing a very public marriage proposal with the twenty-first-century excuse, I need a moment<br />This is a loose, enjoyable and safe spin on the books, with familiar characters doing familiar things within the altered  and digitised  framework of an older Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returning underground to find the Red Queen (a fun Helena Bonham Carter, actually playing a conflation of the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts) ruling a depressed land. <br />The problem with this downtrodden version of Wonderland is that it doesnt always sit well with the mania of Carrolls creations, and when we see a brighter flashback of the Red Queen painting roses, we wish we were in that world. Imagine the Cheshire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), the wise Caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman) and the Mad Hatter (an underwhelming, repetitive Johnny Depp) all doing their thing in the forests of Avatars Pandora after a long bout of acid rain and you begin to get the picture. Much of the colour has been sucked out and replaced with dark skies and long faces.<br />Yet much of Carrolls magical nonsense remains, even if Burtons film wobbles at the gates of anarchy and ends up being a more average affair than many might expect. Its also one in which the inventive costumes and individual flights of animated fancy end up being more memorable than the thin characters and half-hearted 3D rendering. As its Burton at the helm, you could call it gothic. The less generous might just call it gloomy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Trans-Atlantic romantic comedies often reach for easy stereotypes, but few have managed to be as patronising as Leap Year, in which superficial Bostonian Anna (Amy Adams) totters over to Ireland for a love-hate relationship with beardy, muttering Irishman, Declan <br />(Matthew Goode). <br />The plot centres on the idea of a woman proposing on February 29  an Old Irish Tradition, we are told 500 times, as if wed never heard of it. Anxious for a rock on her finger, Anna flies to Ireland to propose to her boyfriend Jeremy (Adam Scott), whos working in Dublin. Re-routed because of bad weather, she must squeeze her designer luggage into the banger driven by Declan, and question her heart when he turns out not to be a complete Neanderthal. <br />While theres some chemistry between the pair, its not enough to compensate for their paper-thin characters, never mind all the crosseyed Guinness-swilling extras and the endless winding country roads that supposedly lead to Dublin. Adams does her level best, but her perkiness quickly wears as thin as her spiky heels on those pesky rural roads.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Whats the best way to deal with a nauseatingly cute trio of Hollywood pre-teens? Deploy them as weapons. Jackie Chan should get some applause for his appropriation of child actors in The Spy Next Door (watch the kid fly!). Actually his goofy, slapstick stunts  devised with his personal team  are perfect for children and pretty good fun. As for the rest, this is a lazy spin on the action-veteran-left-holding-the-baby wheeze (Kindergarten Cop, The Pacifier). Chan is the nerdy guy next door, who is dating the little horrors mother. But really hes a Chinese agent on loan to the CIA. Theres also a Russian oligarch on his tail, with a dastardly plan to destroy the worlds oil reserves, assisted by a clutch of henchmen and the requisite foxy villainess. It comes with the usual kids stuff: wedgies for the boys, adorably skittish pets for the girls. Even the outtakes barely raise a smile. The best of them sees Chan fluffing his lines: I hate English, he mumbles. Who can blame him when its as grindingly predictable as this?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This is the directorial debut of visual effects specialist Scott Stewart, who describes his film as a character-driven action-thriller with supernatural themes, which ignores its over-arching religious angle. Back in 1995, Gregory Widens The Prophecy cast Christopher Walken as the renegade Archangel Gabriel; Stewarts jokier, messier take on The End of Days has similar, high-flown ideas, but nothing serious with which to back them up. <br />This time, its the Archangel Michael (Paul Bettany) whos gone rogue. Tired of humanitys capacity for self-destruction, God has lost patience with those he made in his own image and the harbingers of the apocalypse  storm clouds, swarms of flying insects, a crazy old lady who spews obscenities and walks on the ceiling, a demonic ice-cream man  have reached an isolated diner in the Mojave Desert. <br />Its here that the fate of mankind will be decided, as conflicted Michael tries to protect the unborn child of unmarried waitress Charlie (Adrianne Palicki) from time-serving Gabriel (Kevin Durand), who has come to do Gods bidding. Meanwhile, sundry minor characters are given nothing to do, besides explaining their tedious backstories to one another. <br />Eventually, just when it seems that we have entered a purgatorial limbo where time stands still, it becomes apparent that director Stewarts way of wrestling with big metaphysical themes is to have the Archangels Michael and Gabriel beat the shit out of each other. So we get a punch-up between the lick-spittle Gabriel, armed with a CGI-enhanced mace, and the rebellious Michael, armed with a profound sense of moral righteousness. Celestial tosh of less than Biblical proportions.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Following a disastrous incursion into bubblegum high-school romance territory (I Love You, Beth Cooper), Chris Columbus, director of the first two Harry Potters, returns to his comfort zone for this episodic and mirthless fantasy saga based on the first of a series of fantasy books by US writer Rick Riordan.<br />Mulching together the angsty teen intrigue of Harry Potter and the frigid-and-proud flagwaving of Twilight, the film sees Zac Efron lookalike Logan Lerman (Gamer) playing an underachiever who turns out to be a sword-swinging demigod when he discovers his birth was the result of the god Poseidon (Kevin McKidd) having a quick fling with dowdy New York housewife Catherine Keener. When his mother is kidnapped by Hades (Steve Coogan in full Saxondale mode) as a bargaining chip for Zeuss lost lightning bolt, Percy is charged with finding a number of trinkets dotted across North America in order to avert a crisis on Mount Olympus (located just above the New York cloud cover, who knew?) and save mom from eternal damnation. <br />That Percy risks life and limb to preserve the family unit is typical Columbus, and the film works best when playing on the idea that no amount of bravado is enough to mask our desire for parental love. Yet its not enough to compensate for the computer-game-style plotting, which is largely based on us picking up narrative nuggets that mechanically slot into place later on. Problematic, too, is the product placement: witness the scene in which Percy battles Medusa (Uma Thurman) and avoids her deathly gaze by craftily using the shiny back of his iPod as a mirror.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Foxs foray into Bollywood examines the fallout of 9/11 on NRIs (Non Resident Indians) in Bushs America. Khan (Shah Rukh Khan), a Muslim man with Aspergers syndrome, travels across the USA in order to meet the President. My Name is Khan; I am not a terrorist is his mantra. Karan Johar, Bollywoods biggest director, admirably addresses a sensitive topical issue within the widest commercial context. He incorporates marital strife, communal conflict, racism, bullying, a mamma subplot, and a catchy soundtrack (frustratingly not subtitled) to convey his progressive agenda. The result is a film of tonal inconsistency which reflects its simplistic good people/bad people view of human nature. Technically accomplished, its always engaging due to the credible performances from its beautiful leads, the charismatic Khan and Kajol. Worthy, but flawed.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[His playbook may be a bit unorthodox but he gets things done! The most recycled snippet of dialogue in the maverick-cop genre is rolled out to honour the dubious methods of lead-sheddin, gack-snorting FBI wildman, Charlie Wax (John Travolta). Looking like Fu-Manchu in surplus combat gear and not so much chewing the scenery as using it for target practice, hes teamed with preppy, pencil-pushing office bod James Reece (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) to take down a Parisian drug cartel as quickly and violently as possible. <br />With the story swiftly descending into a series of spuriously linked encounters in which the pair find themselves terrorised by many different ethnic minorities, the film is best when examining the unexpected chemistry between its unlikely leads. Cinematographer-turned-director Pierre Morel (Taken) composes the action sequences with the balletic sheen of Hong Kong-era John Woo, but its not enough to allow the film to rise above its guilty-until-proven-innocent conception of justice. Reprehensible, then, but what fun! <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Anyone heading to the cinema this February 14 will find themselves conspicuously catered for by this romantic comedy from veteran Garry Marshall (Pretty Woman, Beaches). Throwing out a net to everyone from back-row teenage saliva-swappers to seasoned seniors, the film feels like it has been coldly calculated to hoover up demographics. How? Marshall gives his rom-com the Robert Altman Short Cuts treatment: an enormous megawatt ensemble cast appear in a dozen or so interlocking lurve stories that play out on Valentines Day in Los Angeles. Its supremely efficient and utterly ruthless.<br />There are 19 all-star names above the title (in alphabetical order, naturally) but the lead belongs to Ashton Kutcher. A nice-guy florist, he proposes to his work-addict girlfriend (Jessica Alba), but is obviously much better suited to his teacher best friend (Jennifer Garner). Jessica Biel (is it me, or are the Jessicas interchangeable?) plays a neurotically single sports publicist. Anne Hathaway, an office temp who moonlights as a phone sex operator (little nod to Short Cuts there), hasnt told her new boyfriend about the sideline. Shirley MacLaine, happily married for 50 years, is keeping an old secret from her husband. In what reeks of final-draft add-on, country star Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner from The Twilight Saga pair up as school sweethearts: no actual storyline here, but they tick the pre-teen box big time.<br /><br />These are sassily-scripted but glossy, vacuous fantasies  with the exception of Julia Robertss army captain, whos on short leave from Iraq and meets a guy (Bradley Cooper) on a plane: after some sparky but non-committal flight banter they go their separate ways and both their tales resolve with unexpectedly lovely flourishes. Their stories make the rest of the film look like its got a cold, shiny cash register right where its heart should be.<br />]]></review>

As seen in the stunning, eerily atmospheric expos <i>Videocracy,</i> a freeform look at Italys celeb-obsessed culture, theyre actually auditioning to become velineand it shouldnt surprise anyone to learn that Silvio Berlusconis bust-friendly media empire has a specific word for these starlets hired to strut, strip and stand silently next to talk-show hosts. </p><p>Despite a prestigious world premiere at 2009s Venice Film Festival, Erik Gandinis Fellini-esque nightmare of a doc has taken a fair amount of political heat in Italy for its indictment of Berlusconis universe. It pivots (as does the prime minister himself) from the television studio to the legislature and back. One of the mind-boggling clips unearthed here is that of the producer-politicos first TV success: a 70s quiz show that rewarded correct answers with the sight of a housewife shedding her clothes. It feels like a major excavationthe Rosetta stone by which we might come to understand <i>Jersey Shore.</i></p><p>Hedonism leads to a new kind of fascism, and only cynics will be able to discount a talent scouts gushing about Mussolini. But <i>Videocracy</i> has even more to show; this is a hell of many circles. (To Gandinis credit, his quiet, synth-scored movie never feels like its hectoring.) We shift from dance clubs and billionaire resorts to a profile of the countrys reigning king of gossip, Fabrizio Coronatall, stylish, heavily tattooed. His paparazzi squads earn him massive resentment; then he becomes a star himself after being imprisoned for extortion. The documentary slows to focus on this cryptic man, both exploiter and martyr, a mystery even when hes completely nude in the shower. Corona, its suggested, is the new power brokermaybe even the new Berlusconi. Your heart sinks. As ever, Italy is years ahead of everyone.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The original title of the Stieg Larsson novel which became, in translation, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was Men Who Hate Women: a blunt but fitting description of this angry, intelligent but curiously uninvolving Swedish shaggy dog story. The film sees down-at-heel, crusading journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) hired by industrialist Henrik Vanger to look into the disappearance of his beloved niece more than 30 years before. Blomkvists quest is intercut with the story of Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), a bisexual ex-con cyberpunk computer hacker (only in Sweden!) at the mercy of a corrupt, sexually deviant parole officer.<br />Throughout this beautifully photographed, skilfully constructed film theres a sense were skimming lightly over Larssons characters and themes. Blomkvist is the putative hero, but his investigative journey is a little too familiar, his character too clean-cut to be compelling. Its Salander who holds the attention: superbly played by Rapace, shes a grim, spectral presence in the opening scenes, before shes pushed too far and explodes in a moment of shocking, vengeful violence.<br /><br />Such scenes place The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo above the extended TV mystery it easily could have become, but explicit violence only takes you so far. At heart this is a traditional thriller, down to a series of convenient and underwhelming last-act revelations. For fans of Larssons books this could be the highlight of the cinemagoing year  for the rest of us its a solid, enjoyable but emotionally unengaging detective story.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Thirty-five years after Network and All the Presidents Men, in which journalists told uncomfortable truths and defended democracy, Green Zone makes military personnel do the noble work which craven reporters shirk. The only consolation is that the movie is inspired by a work of journalism, Rajiv Chandrasekarans Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraqs Green Zone.<br /><br />Set in Iraq in the months following the 2003 invasion, the film reunites the director and star of The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon; this time, however, we already know the details of the underhanded government action our hero confronts. Damon plays an army warrant officer whose WMD sorties keep coming up empty; unwilling to roll over, hes soon embroiled in a turf war between the CIA and the Pentagon (personified by conscientious Brendan Gleeson and oleaginous Greg Kinnear) while attempting to wrangle a Baathist general (Igal Naor), a useful veteran (Said Faraj) and a useless embedded reporter (Amy Ryan) against a backdrop of more-or-less real events.<br />Greengrasss approach to real-life disaster is far more simplified and pumped up here than it was in United 93 or Bloody Sunday, but theres much to be said for his Bourne in Baghdad approach. The action is robust, the politics simplified but strident, insisting that a wilfully under-prepped war worked against both US and Iraqi interests. By shifting focus from the naively doctrinaire civilians of Chandrasekarans book to street-level soldiers questioning authority, Greengrass concocts a formula with a fighting chance of dispelling the Curse of the Hollywood Iraq Movie. If a picture as conventionally accessible as Green Zone tanks, that campaign is surely lost.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Banksy has a weird relationship with fame. Lets call it the reverse Jordan: hes famous for not being famous. He breeds celebrity then rejects it. Just last year he was the subject of an odd film made by the ICAs ex-chairman Ivan Massow called Banksys Coming to Dinner, in which an actor duped Joan Collins into believing she was hosting a dinner party for the street artist. All signs suggest Collins was party to the gag. But was Banksy also in on it? Probably not. But still it fed his notoriety. His anonymity is a handy tease  a tool which allows him to draw attention to himself while at the same time deflecting it.<br />This is the spirit of Exit Through the Gift Shop, a new documentary brought to us by Banksy but not directed by him (the film has no such credit). It profiles Banksy and prods at issues raised by his success, from originality to commercialisation. But its a wonky, sideways profile in that the film pretends not to be about Banksy. He  or whoever made the film  employs a fall guy to make himself look good. Call it passive self-promotion. Some even call it a hoax. But thats missing the point: even if the final section of the film doesnt feel as honest as the earlier parts, theres nothing to suggest that the whole thing is made up (which is different from savvy editing and presentation). Part of the problem is that we expect a Banksy project to be a joke on us. Whatever the film is, its sparky and funny and invigorating to watch.<br />The fall guy  lets call him Banksys mirror  is Thierry Guetta, a hipster French exile in Los Angeles introduced to us from the beginning as obsessed with video cameras and looking for an outlet for a creeping early middle-aged ennui. Essentially the film has two narrators: Rhys Ifans, buoying the story along in voiceover, and Banksy, who pops up occasionally in silhouette to offer commentary. Both lend their voice to a mass of archive footage, much of it shot by Guetta, who, were told, started filming his cousin Invader (the French bloke who plasters mosaics everywhere) in the late 90s and moved on to other artists, including Shepard Fairey and Banksy.<br />Were told that after many years of filming these artists on roofs, at night or in their studios, Guetta edited his footage into a mess called Life Remote Control. Which is where Banksy decided to take over and turn the archive into something watchable. Which is where we join the party.<br />The cheeky twist in the tale is that Guetta, encouraged by Banksy, then becomes an artist too. He exhibits and sells work at a hyped-up Los Angeles show, and all the signs are that Banksy is closer to this late creative flowering than he admits. Most of Guettas works look like D-grade Banksy rip-offs and theres a sense that theres a smart mind behind this bad work, which includes a giant aerosol can labelled with branding for Campbells Tomato Spray.<br />So, whether Guettas burgeoning art career is under the patronage or direction of Banksy  or both  is the question you must take away. Whatever the answer, the film is a rousing tribute to street art, a crafty autobiography and a cheeky comment on the bravado of artists, talented or otherwise, and the gullibility of their punters  us included.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The post-Poppins supernanny returns thanks to capable screenwriter-star Emma Thompson, whos set the story during World War Two when daddies are away fighting, and children man the home front. Down on the farm, Maggie Gyllenhaals Mrs Green is at a loss when her three terrors are joined by their posh cousins, evacuated from the threat of bombs over Kensington, though its not long before ex-military Nanny McPhee instils improving discipline. The mix is similar to the first film, naughtiness versus magic, but nimbler this time as it shuttles from class warfare to unscrupulous spivs (draft-dodging well-dodgy uncle Rhys Ifans) and the prospect of enemy attack. Its bitty and rather light on mounting excitement, yet Thompson the writer smuggles in cheery elements of Enid Blyton and A Little Princess, the frolicking Old Spot piglets are a delight, and Nannys resourceful jackdaw Edelweiss a cult hero in the making. Director Susanna White, surely one to watch, manages some disarming emotional grace notes under the circumstances.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This Brit romcom has been described as very funny and flimsy  and both are kinda right. Loosely based on Alain de Bottons Essays in Love, it stars the underqualified Brendan Patricks (Horne &amp; Corden) as loser-in-love Duncan. While unconvincingly contemplating suicide, Duncan recalls his past five relationships with unfeasibly attractive women in busy, self-consciously quirky flashbacks.<br /><br />There are bad actors here , and there are great actors  Naomie Harris and Michael Sheen appear alongside evident newbies. Some ideas are inventive  Duncan runs through the odds of meeting his first girlfriend in amusing detail  while others feel lazy and clichd. Theres a steady trickle of fun character observations, but a lack of detail and depth. The film feels a bit like a funny friend who talks too much  sometimes theyre amusing; sometimes you wish theyd shut up. Those willing to overlook the cracks in performances and plot should enjoy it, but they may also wish to revisit High Fidelity to see how its really done.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[A work of masterly daring and skill, the new Italian film I Am Love plays out in the late 1990s within a super-rich family called the Recchis. Their power base is a Milanese villa introduced to us by young director Luca Guadagnino as a gilded cage  a marble-and-stone palace too large and ornate to support intimate family life. In the films early scenes Guadagnino laps up this mansion, exploring it with a swirling, fluid camera that turns its world into a character itself. The fictional Recchis recall the Agnellis, another troubled industrialist family which feathered its nest on the back of fascism, but they trade in textiles, not cars, and Guadagnino gives us a brief shot of their mechanised looms at work to stress how business is woven into the fabric of this familys soul.<br />We meet the Recchis on the cusp of change  and change is the films main interest, along with the dangerous strength necessary for any woman to counter the forces of tradition and expectation in such a family. We begin by watching the elderly family head (Gabriele Ferzetti) at dinner as he nominates his successors in a scene of King Lear-like power and unnaturalness. But soon he is dead and our focus and heroine becomes Emma Recchi (Tilda Swinton), the dutiful Russian wife of Tancredi (Pippo Delbono), the familys new head, and mother to two grown-up sons and a daughter attempting her own flight from this patriarchal world. Emmas burgeoning friendship with her sons business partner, Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini), a rural chef, is the nudge that will bring this house of cards down in dramatic, tragic fashion. <br />The story is bold enough, but true daring is at play in the films style. Guadagnino has the confidence to mix big, brash Dallas-style establishing shots of Milan and London and complicated scenes of busy parties with much more intimate, expressive moments. Dialogue becomes less important as the film progresses, and Guadagnino invites us to read the film rather than the characters lips. He also manages to bring the film to an operatic crescendo without losing sight of emotional realities.<br />There are many reasons to recommend this sensual and good-looking film about personal and female liberation. The music is one; it is central to a work that demands that all the films elements work together to create a total cinema. Guadagnino and his star and co-producer, Swinton, persuaded John Adams, the composer of operas such as Nixon in China and Doctor Atomic, to allow his work to be used in a film for the first time and his crashing, arresting, impulsive music is gripping from the start.<br />Its a fitting collaboration. Adams has given modern opera a much-needed shot in the arm and thats what Swinton (who speaks Italian throughout) and Guadagnino are striving to achieve: I Am Love is a brazen blueprint for a cinema that straddles past and future while worrying little about trends of the present. Its a bold experiment rooted in tradition. It plays like smart opera and looks like a marriage of poetic documentary with classical European drama. Swinton and Guadagnino call it Visconti on acid and thats as good a phrase as any to describe the films intoxicating allure.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[George Romeros original The Crazies was a prime slice of raw mid-70s exploitation schlock: scruffy, violent and politically edgy. Breck Eisners remake is slicker, prettier and dumber, but not entirely without merit. The cast is very strong: Timothy Olyphant exudes old-fashioned tough-guy charm as the small town sheriff whose constituents begin falling prey to a disease which turns them into bloodthirsty zombies, while Radha Mitchell provides credible if thankless support as his wife. Theres also an impressively high-strung turn from Joe Anderson (Peter Hook in Control) as a redneck cop on the brink.<br />But the film feels choppy and roughly edited, as though its makers were so keen to keep it short that they hacked out any scares, atmosphere or sense of impending dread. Theres too much story and key details are absent or underexplained. Though far from unwatchable, The Crazies feels like a missed opportunity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Neil Jordan has fallen into a regular pattern of late, following every trip to Hollywood with a more personal Irish indie. You can feel the loving care in every frame of Ondine, but that only serves to make this saccharine, crudely plotted romance feel even more misguided. <br />Colin Farrell plays Syracuse, a trawlerman and recovering alcoholic who pulls a mysterious, scantily clad woman (Alicja Bachleda) from the sea in his net. Bringing her to the mainland, Syracuse and his disabled daughter (the terrific Alison Barry) become convinced that the stranger, who calls herself Ondine, is in fact a mythical selkie: part woman, part seal. <br />These unabashed fairy-tale elements fit uncomfortably with the more earthbound elements of Jordans script, not to mention his habit of getting Bachleda to shed her clothes at every opportunity. A clunky third-act shift into thriller territory only makes Ondine more confused: ambitious and deeply felt, to be sure, but also winsome and wildly uneven.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Unlike its cockney equivalent, the Irish gangster movie  however hackneyed its storyline  can usually be relied upon to deliver a modicum of wit and flair. Perriers Bounty is a prime example: it marries a predictable plot  Cillian Murphy owes money to some bad fellas, complications ensue  with a goodly portion of smart banter, off-kilter characterisation and knockabout violence.<br />The film is flawlessly cast, with Murphys put-upon hero ably backed by Jim Broadbent as his world-weary Pa and Jodie Whitaker as the emotionally compromised woman in his life, while a monstrous, towering Brendan Gleeson lords over proceedings as the titular crime bigwig. They bring a sense of playfulness and pathos to the project that probably wasnt there in the busy, amateurish script, stuffed as it is with twists, switchbacks and gangland clichs. Ian Fitzgibbons direction is a little flat and uninspiring and the urban photography is unnecessarily gritty and downbeat. But despite these setbacks, Perriers Bounty is still a pleasure to watch: not exactly memorable, but packed with enough intellect, incident and strong performances to justify the investment.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Lasse Hallstrms latest is based on a true story  transplanted from 1930s Japan to contemporary New England  about a faithful Akita dog called Hachi. Hallstrms unfussy, effective film uses several visual techniques  dogs eye-view black-and-white footage, sped-up time frames  to tell the often moving tale of Parker Wilson (Richard Gere), a music professor and family man who surrenders to the charms of dog ownership. When Parker dies and his family sells up and moves away, Hachi legs it back to the railway station where his owner used to arrive home from work and keeps vigil there for almost a decade. Sensitively directed and rarely over-sentimental, this touching parable will likely ravish the emotions of dog lovers. Yet the film is as much about the emotional fallout of death as about a mutts loyalty and devotion. As a dog owner, I must confess to having had a large lump in the throat throughout. So call me soppy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Policeman, husband, father, closeted gay man, out gay man, fraudster, prison escapee, fake lawyer, embezzler, prison escapee (again) Georgias Steven Russell has led quite a life. Hes a subject ripe for documentary treatment, but its understandable why Bad Santa writers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa have turned his wild CV into madcap comedy for their directing debut. Unleashing Jim Carrey makes a sort of sense, since his fast-talking energy might help us buy Russells credibility-defying exploits. Unfortunately, though, the bizarre true-life aspect gets swamped by Carreys ramped-up zeal, delivering a series of showpiece flourishes which dazzle at first but then prove wearing.<br />Still, you cant accuse cast or filmmakers of lacking caution, since the treatment barrels through locations and chronology, and its eyebrow-raising to have Carrey and Ewan McGregor  as sweet-natured fellow jailbird Phillip Morris  playing frisky gay lovers. Such forthrightness definitely makes the movie culturally significant (and may explain why US distributors have been reluctant to handle it), yet for all that it never manages to match its robust humour with a convincing love story. Maybe we dont quite buy Jim and Ewans hots for one another, maybe the writing makes Carreys character too much of a psychotic narcissist while rendering McGregor in terms of fluffy-bunny passivity, but either way it just aint happening. Loved the chutzpah, but the heart and the funny bone are left relatively untroubled.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Hollywoods campaign to convince audiences that beefy Scots bulldog Gerard Butler can play the romantic lead gathers pace with this misjudged marital crime caper. Butler plays Milo Boyd, an ex-cop turned bail bondsman assigned to haul in his ex-wife Nicole (Jennifer Aniston), a hotshot reporter in deep with the law. The pursuit takes this pair of bickering exes from New York to Atlantic City and back, via a series of perfunctory car chases, poorly choreographed punch-ups and excruciating romantic entanglements.<br />The trouble is not so much that Butler isnt funny  he isnt, even slightly  but that he sucks the merest hint of humour from the entire enterprise. Even proven performers like Aniston and Christine Baranski as a sexually voracious mother-in-law are reduced to desperate mugging and hysterical arm-waving in an attempt to fill the comic vacuum which their muscular co-star leaves in his wake. To be fair, the script gives them little to work with: there are maybe three decent laughs, interspersed with long stretches of interminable, would-be witty banter and one near-unwatchable comedy torture scene. <br />The score, too, is atrocious: infuriatingly cheeky in the comedy scenes, switching to screeching Bon Jovi-esque AOR whenever things kick off. The Bounty Hunter isnt bad enough to be offensive: its simply lazy, trite, smug, irritating and a colossal waste of time, talent and money. Therell be worse films released in 2010  but not many.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[British director Bernard Rose (Anna Karenina, Ivansxtc) continues his ongoing Tolstoy project with this low-budget, DV spin on the Russians banned 1889 novella of sexual jealousy and rage. Much is familiar from 2000s Ivansxtc: Danny Huston again plays a louche, wealthy Los Angeles native (minus the cocaine and call-girls), while Rose again adopts a handheld shooting style, filming in upscale locations and using only available light. This portrait of the Californian rich and powerful is much less savage than Ivansxtc, although again the rolling timbre of Hustons voice and the crafty smile on his face are reason alone to see the film.<br />Huston plays Edgar, a paranoid husband who suspects that his wife, Abby (Elisabeth Rhm)  a lapsed pianist and mother of his kids  is having an affair with Aiden (Matthew Yang King), a violinist with whom she agrees to perform Beethovens Kreutzer Sonata at a fundraising event at their lavish home . Rose intercuts Hustons impetuous behaviour as his imagination runs wild and his anger escalates with flashbacks of his earlier, happier relationship with his wife. <br />The films looseness  many lines feel improvised, as does the camerawork  is mostly attractive and matches Hustons charming, easy presence. The tragedy, when it comes, might not feel as poignant or significant as Ivansxtc, but this is a fun dose of literary soap opera with some likeable performances, including a cameo from Hustons sister, Anjelica, and some authentically racy sex scenes to mark the first throes of Edgar and Abbys love affair.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[As the intro to this excellent documentary asserts, one small Caribbean island continues to dominate Olympic boxing. Sons of Cuba explores the roots of that success, following a year at the Havana City Boxing Academy and a gang of pre-pubescent pugilists training for the under-11s national championships. Director Andrew Lang narrows his focus to three kids  one a poet, one a performer and one a hardened, thoroughbred blood-and-bone boxing superstar in the making. The sense of kinship between the kids and their caring, ambitious coach is deeply moving, as is the boys absolute commitment to their nation and its Commandante, Fidel Castro. But is their grim, ascetic existence really the only way to turn these boys into champions, or is this just a subtle form of state-sanctioned child abuse? Lang, wisely, refuses to judge, preferring to let this beautifully structured story of sacrifice, companionship, grief and glory speak for itself.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This documentary, both rousing and dispiriting, narrated by Samuel L Jackson and produced by The Roddick Foundation, shines a spotlight on the case of two prisoners in Louisianas notorious Angola prison (population: 5,000) who have been lingering in solitary for 37 years for a crime many people believe they never committed. Herman Wallace and Albert Woodfox were minor criminals and members of the Black Panther Party when in 1972 they were accused of murdering a prison guard  a crime of which even the guards wife believes they were innocent, not least because the witnesses were so unreliable (one was blind; another was promised freedom). <br />Another man, Robert King, was later hauled into jail from the outside for investigation and accused of murdering an inmate; together they became known as the Angola Three, although King was finally released in 2001. Interviews with King, Wallace and Woodfox, with lawyers and politicians and even with the guards wife, make this a rounded study and as much a portrait of what its like to spend four decades locked up as a rallying cry for the freedom of innocent men.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For the past year, 3D has been a guarantee of box-office gold, as proven by the runaway success of Avatar. But now, for the first time, a film arrives for which the 3D element may prove to be a commercial hindrance. Its not only that Clash of the Titans will compete with Alice in Wonderland, How to Train Your Dragon and Avatar for the nations 3D screens. More critically than that, the film's conversion to 3D (a decision taken late in the filmmaking process) has rendered this campy, unashamedly old-school but still highly enjoyable blockbuster rather painful to watch.<br />In story terms, Clash of the Titans doesn't stray too far from the beloved 1981 Ray Harryhausen classic which spawned it. The setting is mythical Ancient Greece  an age of Gods, monsters and muscular men in little chainmail skirts. Sam Worthington is Perseus, an orphaned demi-God drawn into the battle between man and the immortals when Hades (Ralph Fiennes), lord of the underworld, threatens to unleash his great sea-beast, the Kraken, on the city of Argos. Accompanied by a ragtag band of warriors, Perseus sets off to learn the secrets of the Kraken and end the reign of the Gods once and for all.<br />Theres no ignoring the fact that Clash of the Titans is a mess: the plot is episodic and rushed, the dialogue blunt and occasionally laughable, and there are far too many characters, few of whom leave much of an impression. Both Worthington and love interest Gemma Arterton look like theyre on a strenuous Aegean package holiday, but luckily theyre surrounded by the likes of Fiennes, Pete Postlethwaite and Liam Neeson as Zeus, whose commanding, armour-clad presence seems, at times, to be the only thing holding this crumbling edifice together.<br />Other notable names dont fare so well: Danny Huston gets a mighty fake beard but just one line as sea-God Poseidon, Mads Mikkelsen does little more than bare his teeth as burly swordsman Draco and, most egregiously, Jason Flemyng gets a terrific backstory and some superb melting-face makeup as ruined ruler Calibos  and that's it. It's is a recurring problem throughout the film: with dialogue and character motivation cut back to the bare minimum, theres no way for anyone to express themselves except through action.<br />But, luckily, this is where Clash of the Titans succeeds. Whatever the flaws in the script, theres no faulting director Louis Leterriers visual ambition: this is a film of mighty vistas, beautifully designed beasts and intense, well-structured combat sequences, all rendered in eye-popping, though still rather fake-looking, CGI. Taking the lessons of The Lord of the Rings to heart, Leterrier goes all-out for excess: his computer-generated camera soars above sprawling cities, endless deserts and blasted underworld hellscapes, lending the film a dizzying, epic scale.<br />A shame, then, that the addition of 3D has rendered much of this grandeur all but unwatchable, blurring the image to a headache-inducing degree and adding absolutely nothing to a film which was obviously shot in two dimensions and should have stayed that way. As an experiment in high-Hollywood style over substance, Clash of the Titans is a very entertaining ride. But take our advice: sidestep the 3D and see it the old fashioned way. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Space has been reliable garganto-vision fodder in museum planetaria for decades, and this latest IMAX spectacle has its share of breathtaking cosmic vistas. But the 20-year-old Hubble Space Telescopewhose repair mission is the subject of this chronicleturns out to be a bit of a stage hog, and audiences expecting a blissout of swirling galaxies will wonder why so much time is spent on astronauts sweating over screws and bolts.</p><p>Of course, just about anything looks fairly impressive blown up to brownstone-size, and the movie offers a mlange of material: astrofolk training underwater, an earthshaking rocket launch, living-quarter antics and artful computer visualizations of Hubbles crown-jewel data. (Its a mix of footage from both the early 1990s and last years sortie, stirred together and haphazardly upgraded to bigger-faster-better 3D status.) Things perk up once the telescopes findings start sending a thousand points of light hurling at usthough these cotton-candy nebulae and whirligig baby stars are each laden with the multiplying cosmic-slop metaphors of Leonardo DiCaprios voiceover. Despite the astronauts bravery and good humor, their work on the Hubble, captured in cluttered shots, is not nearly as exciting as the brave new frontiers conjured up by the term <i>spacewalk.</i> But even if this stroll through the heavens isnt as immersive as, say, the recent Deep Sea IMAX, its still a trip. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The 3D bandwagon keeps rolling with this smart, muscular, animated adventure. On a remote North Atlantic island, the Viking population is suffering harassment from swarms of marauding dragons, until geeky son-of-a-chief Hiccup finds an injured dragon in the woods and suspects this constant state of warfare may be unnecessary.<br />Rejecting the comic whimsy of Cressida Cowells source novel, How to Train Your Dragon is a surprisingly robust affair, backing its juggernaut narrative with a well-judged and timely political subtext which urges young viewers to question received wisdom and make up their own minds, especially when it comes to matters of life and death. The voices can be jarring  the burly adult Vikings are all Scots, while their offspring are whiny Yanks  and the characterisation remains disappointingly old fashioned and unoriginal. But the visuals are striking, the script sharp and well paced and it all wraps up with a breathtaking aerial battle sequence.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Imagine if Guy Ritchie had been weaned on blaxploitation and dubstep rather than eel pie and The Italian Job and youre halfway to understanding Shank, a raucous and violent ghetto drama set on a London council estate of the near future that pits hooded clans of teen marauders against one another in a rudimentary tale of blood vengeance. Like Ritchie, debut director Mo Ali and writer Paul van Carter have clearly dedicated a lot time to making sure their film achieves a measure of street authenticity, and with its inventive production design and spiky, lingo-flecked dialogue, they do succeed in that area. Its a shame, then, that the narrative itself is so slovenly, as our multicultural mob led by avenging angel Junior (Kedar Williams-Stirling) take a long, diversionary road en route to a carve-up with scramble-biking nuisance Tugz (Jerome Holder). The likable performances and humorous interactions between characters show that Ali can work with actors. The hectic direction shows that he has yet to master the art of storytelling. A promising first effort, nonetheless.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Kung-Fu Panda is one of those movies where one assumes the title came first and the entire plot was then extrapolated by committee. Rotund, noodle-selling bear Po (voiced by Jack Black) discovers that he is the living embodiment of an ancient Shaolin legend, which drives him to train as a martial arts expert and confront psychotic snow leopard Tai-Lung. Hes aided on his quest by crotchety Zen master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and his menagerie of high-flying wire-fu legends, the Furious Five.<br /><br />Theres no chop-socky clich too hackneyed for the filmmakers to make meat of. Inscrutable, riddle-spouting guru, check. Ancient mystical jade temple, check. Uptempo training montage, check. The setting is a sort of Disneyland version of ancient China, all fast-running waterfalls, snapping chopsticks and spiralling bamboo parasols. The script is as thin as rice paper and the characters, though likeable, are simply too plentiful, and too many of them feel short-changed. <br />The ending was extensively rewritten and it shows, limping to an underwhelming conclusion from which many of the best characters are inexplicably absent. But for all its faults, theres something inescapably likeable about Kung-Fu Panda. Po is a winning hero, engagingly silly and offbeat, particularly in his workout scenes with the frustrated, irascible Shifu. Villain Tai-Lung, voiced with fearsome dignity by Ian McShane , is one of the best cartoon baddies since Shere Khan, and his prison-escape set piece is the standout here, explosive and enthralling.<br /><br />This is where the movie comes into its own. The action sequences are often astounding, the high-octane animated choreography superbly executed. Theres nothing radical about the visuals themselves  the character and landscape design is entirely by-the-numbers. But weve never seen a cartoon move this fast before, the camera leaping and swooping along with its gravity-proof protagonists. <br />As the credits roll, the films many flaws come sharply into focus. But while it lasts, Kung-Fu Panda is something of a guilty treat.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In what could be one of the greatest films ever made about the emotional realities of a damaged mind, this giddily disorientating latest from Argentinian director Lucrecia Martel (La Cinaga, The Holy Girl) is a work of frenzied genius. It opens with glamorous, middle-aged dentist Vero (Mara Onetto  a tour de force) driving along a quiet dirt track. Theres a sudden bump. Shes hit something. But what? A dog? Or maybe one of the teens weve seen loitering on the roadside? Clutching her brow, she speeds off without finding out what, exactly, just dented her fender.<br />As with the question of who is sending the tapes in Michael Hanekes Hidden, Martel spends the remainder of the film cultivating a mystery whose solution, it transpires, may be extraneous to the actual story she is trying to tell. Casually dispensing with exposition and formal character introductions, she instead burdens us with an intimate, first-hand experience of Veros temporary discombobulation. Veros tragic attempts to bluff her way through a life that has lost all meaning are perfectly realised by Martels brand of ambient, almost dreamlike social realism, where each shot demands a swift decoding to reveal its ulterior purpose.<br />In line with the directors previous films, theres an incisive political subtext lurking under this ostensibly interior drama. While Veros loss of memory adds a level of discomfort to her daily life, it also allows her a spell of self-reflection and moral rejuvenation. Her anxiety awakens a mindfulness of her bourgeois complacency which in turn makes her reassess the connections she has with her own family. The bitter closing shot, though, suggests that you can never change those accustomed to a life of privileged conformity. Its a supremely disconcerting kiss-off to a cinematic head-trip like no other.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A dancer, said choreographer Maurice Bjart, must be half nun, half boxer. Possibly the same applies to documentary makers; whether it was grace or pugnacity that won Wiseman his startling access to the Paris Opra Ballet, something worked. We watch performances and rehearsals, meetings and a fraught interview between the artistic director and a nervous newbie, which ends ominously with a compliment on the latters weight loss. Theres no commentary: like a dancer, Wiseman tells by showing. The dancing itself, surprisingly contemporary for such a venerable institution, is breathtaking, but Wiseman doesnt get carried away: theres a sombre moment during a meeting about pensions  which start at age 40 for dancers  when the camera pans across this feast of glowing bodies, as if to warn of the toll their art invariably takes. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This years romantic heartthrob, R-Patz  Twilight star Robert Pattinson to those non-fanatics among you  has an executive-producer credit attached to this unobjectionable but slightly arch and sentimentalised 2001-set New York romantic drama. This may suggest an effort on his part to add thespian respect and some rebellious street-cred to his image. If so, he might have chosen a more subtle director than Allen Coulter (Hollywoodland, TVs Nurse Jackie, The Sopranos etc) and a better script than this clichd, strangely humourless effort by newcomer Will Fetters.Nevertheless, the all-important romantic mechanics work well enough. <br />The movies meet-cute occurs at the NYU canteen where conflicted rich kid Tyler (Pattinson) dare-dates overprotected, lone-parented Ally (petite star Emilie de Ravin from Lost) on the prompting of Tylers standard-issue flatmate and gooseberry, Aidan (Tate Ellington). Fate, family loss, father obsession and too much booze have brought them together: Allys cop dad (Chris Cooper, wasted) had previously banged up Tyler for a back-street brawl, which explains the cool-looking bruises the nice but nihilistic 21 year old sports throughout the movie  as well as the angry dads embargo and the curtailment of their brief idyll as the calendar turns fatefully towards September<br />Its a movie that craves much indulgence: Pattinson, playing handsome, mixed-up and misunderstood, is watchable enough but he aint no Olivier; while de Ravin bears her straitjacket role of pretty, sweet and wise with good grace. But, be warned, if youre vulnerable to outrageous, cringe-inducing implausibilities  not least the ludicrous stand-up row between Tyler and his father in the latters Twin Towers boardroom  youd best give this one a miss.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Tucked away just off Ladbroke Grove, the Carmelite Monastery of the Most Holy Trinity has been there since 1878, but only now have cameras been allowed a peek inside. The result is a gently reflective portrait which unobtrusively records the daily lot of this cloistered order, but doesnt really dig much deeper than that. Unfolding against the passing seasons, the film quietly observes Carmelite nuns as they carry out devotions and domestic chores alike, maintaining a vow of silence relaxed only during official recreation time. The buzz of a chainsaw in the garden, the chinnnngg! of an iMac start-up and the rumble of nearby traffic noise are reminders of the modern world, but the liturgical rituals and soundless prayers hint at the sisters daily engagement with another realm seemingly beyond our reach.<br />A quartet of impeccably articulate senior nuns voice their opinions on prayer as a place where God can come and speak, but also hint at their struggles to keep the faith during years when theyve felt alone and unanswered. Such vulnerability humanises them for a moment, as do the amusing incongruities of eco-friendly washing powder or jaunty folk dancing. Mostly, though, there remains a benign distance between subject and viewer, which director Michael Whytes modest, somewhat passive approach is unable to breach  no match for the palpable cinematic transcendence of Into Great Silence, Philip Grnings monumentally framed 2005 study of the Grande Chartreuse monastery in the Swiss Alps. No Greater Love knows what spirituality looks like but, pleasantly calming though it is, cant really take us inside.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In 1950, the movies recognised stardom as a pathological disorder. Exhibit A was Sunset Blvd, exhibit B All About Eve. Set in the Broadway jungle rather than among the sun-burnt eager beavers of Hollywood, Joseph L Mankiewiczs film dissects the narcissism and hypocrisy of the spotlight as sharply as Wilders, but pays equal attention to the challenges of enacting womanhood. All About My Mother (not to mention Showgirls) would be unimaginable without it. Anne Baxter is Eve Harrington, the wide-eyed stage-door hanger-on who insinuates her way into the world of Bette Davis sacred monster, Margo Channing; butter-might-just-melt meets gin-hold-the-tonic. The fan who makes an audience of the stars, Eve is soon attracting her own admirers, as well as barbs worthy of Mankiewiczs 30s newsroom pedigree. Edith Heads costumes stress the antagonism: Eve enters in a sexy-modest trenchcoat-and-trilby combo, and could anyone but Davis pull off a ball gown with pockets? Meanwhile, the real threat  Marilyn Monroe  sits at the partys edge, shining, angling for another drink.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>This live action version of the 1960s cartoon uses CGI to make its canine hero talk and fly, but thats about the only modern touch in this plodding, old-fashioned caper. Misfit mutt Shoeshine (voiced by Jason Lee) gets a dose of a chemical formula that makes him Underdog  so dubbed by his new human pal, insipid youngster Jack (Alex Neuberger).</p><p>Jacks equally uninspiring father (Jim Belushi) gets dragged into the drama when evil scientist Dr Barsinister (Peter Dinklage) gets wind of Underdogs conspicuous powers, which hes using to help people, Lassie-style. Dr Barsinister, naturally, has other plans for his formula, involving a bomb plot on the city and general world domination. </p><p>A few amusing one-liners creep into the script  boosted in no small part by Lees delivery  but the plots too derivative to deliver. Children with a fondness for pooches and a lack of movie knowledge will be well enough served, but this isnt one of those crossover comedies thats going to get the parents chuckling.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[If the idea of Alvin and his chirruping chipmunks friends sounds familiar, it should: the sped-up, squeaky voices of the cartoon creatures have been irritating audiences since the 50s smash hit The Chipmunk Song. This live action version sees the computer-generated furry trio Alvin, Simon and Theodore wind up in LA when their tree is felled for Christmas. Not so much innocents abroad as sussed little mammals who speak like urban teens, they become the toast of the town thanks to their vocal talents. The musical numbers are initially appealing  think close harmonies and smart foot stepping to the likes of Funkytown  but the novelty is likely to wear thin for adults when the munks get kitted out as a street boy band. Jason Lee pratfalls away amusingly enough as the songwriter who becomes the boys reluctant father figure, and his wry approach lends an edge to some of the scripts wittier moments. But the storys downhill slide into a hypocritical rant about commerce and the music industry does it no favours.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Coupling the men-on-a-mission antics of Armageddon with the catch-all sci-fi pastiche of TVs Futurama, Space Chimps is an underwhelming slice of lowbrow CGI entertainment. When a hi-tech space probe veers off course on to an uncharted planet, a team of NASA chimpanzees are assigned to a retrieval mission. With Owen Wilson clearly unavailable, SNL alumnus Andy Samberg provides the voice for Ham, the laconic jokester forced to prove his worth. Despite a painfully lurid visual palette and some limp scripting, Space Chimps at least succeeds as undemanding multiplex fare.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[After much tabloid frenzy, the frigid and terrifyingly wholesome tweeny franchise High School Musical reaches part three. It stars Zac Efron, a young fellow of such flawless matinee-idol good looks that he could well have been manufactured in a plastics factory. Set in an immaculately clean Albuquerque high school, the film offers an America of balanced gender quotients, perfect racial mixtures, social conformity, unquestioningly supportive parents, universal teen virginity, gourmet school canteens, universities on tap, prom fixations, detached mini-mansions, plush flowerbeds, alpine vistas and insipid, meaningless pop tunes. Irony is very much on the blacklist. Its the kind of film you imagine well all be sat in front of by the future world high commander when were all brain-drained zombie automatons: Totalitarian Gap Models Sing Pop is what it should be called. <br />Parents might find solace in the fact that High School Musical contains no product placements, but then the film is the product  one long, gaudy, squeaky-clean advertisement. And when we leave the cinema, we can expect to be drowned mercilessly by the merchandising tsunami that follows. Its possible that  for perhaps the first time ever  youll actually wish the film had more product placement: just something, anything, to connect it to reality. Indeed, High School Musical 3 is a film that is so disengaged with the real problems faced by young teenagers that it makes Dirty Dancing look like Les Quatre Cents Coups. The bottom line is, if youve not already booked tickets for the entire family, think twice before being caught up in the hype. At best, youll be disappointed; at worst, youll want to blow up a high school.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[According to the blurb, Fly Me to the Moon is the first computer-animated film designed, created and produced exclusively for the 3D experience. Whether it looks any better than a 2D-to-3D transfer like Meet the Robinsons is a moot point, but there are a few sequences here that use the third dimension to dazzling effect.<br /><br />Nat, IQ and Scooter are houseflies with a mission: to hitch a ride to the moon with the Apollo 11 space team. Once in orbit, they solve a technical glitch while Nats grandpa averts disaster in mission control by thwarting the plans of a Russian infiltrator, Yegor. Its very superficial but endurable in the main, even though it cant resist that old chestnut of painting the Russians as baddies. And while it may not teach sprogs anything about insects  these ones have human eyes and four limbs  director Ben Stassen has made a fair fist of portraying the Apollo mission with some accuracy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Strangely, if somehow confidently, a snarky Midwesterner, Chris Smith, still best known for chasing down wanna-be horror director Mark Borchardt in <i>American Movie,</i> has reinvented himself as a chronicler of small-scale Subcontinental drama. <i>The Pool,</i> Smiths India-made latest, may remind you of <i>Chop Shop</i> or <i>Offside,</i> two recent tales that quietly evoke life on the margins. This isnt Wes Anderson brassily pushing his luggage through <i>The Darjeeling Limited.</i> The respectfulness is winning.</p><p>Lets not question the whys or hows. <i>The Pool</i> takes its original Iowa-based material, written by Randy Russell, and translates it to simmering Panjim, Goa, where industrious youths Venkatesh (Chavan) and Jhangir (Badshah) seem to be constantly cleaning floors. They make a funny couple, the tall, sullen Venkatesh and his tiny, forthright buddy. After toiling daily, they sit in a high tree and observe a serene backyard dominated by a still pool. It is a place of wealth and exclusion, and already, theres something not quite right about it.</p><p>Even as Smith introduces more predictable elementsnotably the throaty cool chick (Mohan, ideal for a Sofia Coppola movie) whose backyard this isthe film never rushes into hyperbole or cuteness. If anything, <i>The Pool</i> feels slightly underdramatized, with surrogate dad Nana Patekar providing a needed shot of gravitas. But the events of these languorous weeks sustain an insistent pull, not in the direction of aching hearts so much as differences of class and the desire to make worldly amends. Guilt and forgiveness hang over the movie; its hard to think of a more welcome piece of American filmmaking.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Ramin Bahrani made a considerable impression with his first two films, Man Push Cart and Chop Shop: low-budget, ground-level portraits of Sisyphean yet dignified solo existences in modern New York. His third film builds on their neo-realist aesthetic and use of non-professionals while expanding the focus to concentrate on a relationship. Solo (Souymane Sy Savan), a garrulous Senegalese cab driver in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (Bahranis home town), is hired by world-weary good old boy William (Red West) to drop him off a couple of weeks hence at what can only be a suicidal assignation. <br />Baffled by his nihilism, the mindful cabbie determines to find a way to reinspire the old man while trying to maintain his relationship with his wife and stepdaughter. The set-up has the ingredients of a mawkish tale of redemption and hugging but Bahrani delivers something else: an endearing character piece shot through with beauty and humility in which, thanks to his leads open, sometimes vulnerable performances, tolerance and respect take precedence. Serious and moving without being solemn or pompous.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The vague term indie rock has shifted a lot in meaning over three decades, but some associations have stuck, namely loud guitars, black-framed glasses and skinny teens in skinny jeans. An unabashed celebration of indie-ness in its most recognisable form, 1234 is unlikely to make many converts but will appeal to anyone whos ever bought the same single on three different formats just to get all the B-sides.<br />Debut writer-director Giles Borg knows his territory: the film is a simple tale of homemade rock n roll romance and takes place in a series of rehearsal studios, pub back rooms and arts labs where his fey, shuffling cast of awkward twentysomethings meet, make music, make eyes and sort of fall in love to a soundtrack of late 90s DIY seven-inches. Its heartfelt, nicely written, competently directed and entertaining, though the the hipper-than-thou namedropping is a bit tiresome, and the underwhelming climax is frustrating in the extreme.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Pixars latest animated marvel may not reach the same heights of wonderment as a Wall-E or a Ratatouille, but those are tough boots to fill and this short, sharp and sweet fantasy still manages to reaffirm its makers as world leaders in the kind of popular animation that embraces ideas and the real world alongside fun and fantasy. Theres just one problem: how do you wipe away a tear while wearing those chunky 3D glasses?<br />Neither a rat nor a robot, the films hero is Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Edward Asner), an elderly man of Middle America who as a youth dreamed of becoming an explorer like Amundsen or Scott. Work and family took over, years passed, and now hes a long-faced widower, living in an old-fashioned home right in the middle of a metropolis. White-haired, square-jawed and stout, he looks like a more homely version of an older Norman Mailer. To outsiders he appears a frail grump, but we know hes mourning his wife and  in some ways  his life.<br />The film is co-directed by Pixar stalwarts Pete Docter and Bob Peterson and  like Wall-E before it  knows the value of silence as well as the need for souped-up action episodes to keep kids awake. As in Wall-E, too, the most grown-up stuff comes early: a brilliant, melancholy chapter, free of talk, runs through Carls life from boyhood to dotage, its triumphs and disappointments: its a staggeringly effective, sad sequence. <br />The story begins as the authorities threaten to place Carl in care after he has a scrap with a property developer looking to bulldoze his home. Carls response to this bureaucratic heavy-handedness is a bugle call to the gods of animation. He ties a thousand balloons to his home and floats off, house and all, to South America to find the waterfalls which he and his wife always dreamed of visiting. But he doesnt bargain on a passenger. In tow is Russell, a podgy child and a wilderness explorer, who wants to help Carl cross a road so that he can win an achievement badge.The balloons are a showcase for modern digital animation as they convincingly float and shimmer; the jungle, too, is a canvas for an explosion of colours and various strange beasts. <br />Theres a touch of Fitzcarraldo as Carl and Russell drag this old mans home through a jungle while fighting off the maniacal ambitions of an even more elderly adventurer who lives in the wilderness. Its not the only element of Up that recalls Herzogs determination to show nature laughing in the face of man. Its a running theme  and gag  throughout. And theres even something of Timothy Treadwell from Grizzly Man about wide-eyed Russell.<br />So, Pixar triumphs again with a delirious fantasy that has one leg in the human world of hopes dashed and realised, and the other in the cartoon tradition of journeying and adventure. The crisp 3D is never gimmicky and the entire film is blessed with the light and air of bright but never gaudy colours.<br />Watch our interview with co-director Pete Docter and producer Jonas Rivera<br /></p>]]></review>

Educational tidbits are thrown out at regular intervals (Amelia Earhart was the first woman to cross the Atlantic, a fact reiterated three times, as if it will appear on a post-film quiz), no doubt to make parents feel like their kids are learning something. What the tykes are likely to learn is how to write a sloppy script. Azaria is the only one really having fun, doing a droll Boris Karloff imitation as an evil Egyptian pharaoh.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Mission: Impossible and Short Circuit meet Babe in this passable CGI-enhanced live-action kiddie diversion which takes suspension of disbelief to new levels by way of an assemblage of talking, crime-fighting guinea pigs.The padded-out story essentially revolves around malevolent entrepreneur Bill Nighys clichd plan to rule the world by having questionable military-grade microchips installed in his companys widely-distributed domestic appliances. When Zach Galifianakiss Dr Dolittle-like miltary boffin smells a rat, he sends in twitchy-nosed rodent Darwin and his cute, well-equipped brethren to carry out a spot of against-the-clock espionage. Hollywoods current sheep-like insistence on releasing most kids films in 3D continues unabated with this sprog-friendly Jerry Bruckheimer chase-fest. Rugrats will probably think differently, but I for one have had enough of watching fuzzy footage through stupid glasses. Though the film as a whole delivers ample thrills, it does lag occasionally and is encumbered by bland voiceovers and a lack of laughs]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Michael Moore still has a good eye for a stunt. Toward the end of Capitalism: A Love Story, his latest documentary polemic about the iniquities of contemporary American culture, he strides through Lower Manhattans Financial District, enclosing the headquarters of various banks and financial institutions within yards and yards of black-and-yellow police tape marked Crime Scene  Do Not Cross. <br />Its as satisfying an emblem of the rottenness at the heart of the system as you could hope for. Its also one of several neat touches in a picture that adheres to Moore form: a thesis to which many liberals would be instinctively favourable (in this case that untrammelled capitalism is socially harmful) is illustrated with engaging and impactful stunts (turning up at the headquarters of Goldman Sachs in an armoured van to ask for the bail-out money back), moving personal testimony (footage of victims of mortgage foreclosures and lay-offs) and an argument that wobbles between locally convincing detail, dubious extrapolation and preposterously unfounded assertion.<br />Capitalism is at its strongest when considered in its domestic context. Die-hard Economist readers aside, few Europeans subscribe to the market-capitalist purism that is perceived in many parts of the US, including some of the poorest, as not just an economic good but a moral and patriotic duty. Moore does a good rhetorical job of questioning the compatibility of capitalism with democracy and Christianity  one priest calls the system a radical evil  in a way that is not controversial here but will shock some Americans. <br />Theres a persuasive if simplified momentum to his potted history of post-war US economics that moves from the prosperity of the 50s through the growing inequality of the 80s to the current catastrophe, illustrated with archive material that ranges from the telling (Reagans numerous spokesmodel gigs) to sub-Adam Curtis glibness. Moores own family home movies and the history of his home town of Flint, Michigan, are put to nice use too. And he presents some outrageous contemporary instances of capitalism gone wild, such as judges locking kids up in exchange for bungs from private borstals and companies taking out profiteering life insurance  actually called dead peasant policies  on their staff.<br />But when it comes to what should be the smoking gun  the subprime meltdown and the financial crisis and global slump it catalysed  Capitalism fires blanks. Moore offers no cohesive argument about how the mortgage crisis happened, why the ramifications were so grave and certainly not why, as he alleges, the US government bail-out amounted to a financial coup dtat. <br />The thesis that rapacious capitalism has horrific social consequences is credible and well illustrated, if hardly eye-opening to European viewers (or, frankly, to Moores likely audience at home); the suggestions that that same capitalism is undemocratic and currently vulnerable to more equitable alternatives require stronger arguments than Moore can rally here. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The title suggests an intimate meeting of the ruler and the ruled as in The Last King of Scotland, but Robert Mugabe only appears in news clips in this very local and often suffocating documentary portrait of a disappearing way of life in Zimbabwe, filmed in secret and under threat of violence. The filmmakers spend ample time with one family of white farmers, the Campbells, who are fighting to keep their property in the face of the Zanu PF governments decision to redistribute land and execute that ruling by force.<br />The films strength lies in its fearless reportage: the filmmakers are present at some extraordinary events, from the arrival of a ministers son to confiscate the land (and his vitriolic speech about Europeans) to the familys various and often futile trips to a regional court in Namibia to seek legal help against the proposed confiscation of their property. The sense of violence, real and threatened, is terrifying, although footage of the Campbells relatives living in comfort in rural Kent is a sobering reminder that white Africans with some wealth and European links, such as the Campbells, ultimately have more chance of an alternative way of life than the black Zimbabweans who work for them.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Read our interview with Poliakoff here</i><br />A political yarn  sometimes creepy, sometimes daft  in the Hitchcockian vein, TV dramatist-playwright Stephen Poliakoffs first film for cinema in a decade is a claustrophobic drama relating to appeasement and the aristocracy in 1939. Poliakoff channels a high-level conspiracy, based on fact, through one high-living family, of which Bill Nighys Alexander is the calm, unreadable patriarch and Romola Garais Anne is the eldest but adopted sibling.<br /><br />Poliakoff places a game Garai in the paranoid centre of the action: a bit like Margaret Lockwood in The Lady Vanishes or Cary Grant in North by Northwest, she appears in every scene bar a modern-day framing device that sadly dilutes some of the films more opaque elements. As Anne stumbles upon some dastardly goings-on, we see everything through her eyes so that you wonder whether shes a victim or just untrustworthy. Poliakoffs heightened dialogue and his actors arch delivery are an acquired taste, but somehow they mostly suit the sense of a nightmare enveloping Anne. If only the plotting were more convincing and the prologue and epilogue less distracting.<br /><i>Read our interview with Poliakoff here</i><br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Pascal-Alex Vincents debut follows a pair of teenage twins (Alexandre and Victor Carril) as they improvise their way from their fathers bakery in France towards Spain and the funeral of a mother they never knew. Theres train-hopping, working in the fields, running away, fights with each other and sex with strangers; the boys make convincing lust objects for a variety of figures. You might think of Y Tu Mam Tambin or Drle de Felix or Two Lane Blacktop or even Days of Heaven. Vincent shows a confident reticence: theres not much dialogue but a lot of travelling shots and play with mobility and stasis. Plenty of work is done by the ambient score and rapport between the Carril brothers  an unarticulated, sometimes animalistic co-dependence that easily swings between play, violence and support and is expressed surprisingly well in a wordless anime prologue whose feel, both simple and complex, joyful and dark, is an apt introduction.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Far more deserving of the hoopla Mike Figgis received for his single-take, multicamera drama <i>Timecode</i> (2000), Finnish visual artist Eija-Liisa Ahtilas experimental narrative truly pushes forward the possibilities of split-screen cinema. Inspired by a real-life incident during the 50s in which two Algerian boys stabbed their young French playmate, the film presents a cryptically lyrical investigation of bridgesbetween history and modernity, Western and Arab cultures, home and identity. Elsewhere, a 40-ish female poet (Outinen) is greeted by Death, whose fateful job causes one character to ponder in voiceover: When you die, where are you? And where is where?</p><p>Everything connects through structure and form: Via screen quadrants, the images speak to each other in two dimensions (not unlike <i>The Brady Bunch </i>credits), inventively in three (glowing words float toward the camera in the top frames, then appear backwards as they move away in the reverse-shot down below), and sometimes four (a knife spins one way, background elements conjunctively spin the other). Time is bent, space is expanded, characters in different eras react to the same noises and were left wondering how much more brilliantly this could unfold in Ahtilas alternate version: a six-channel installation. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Straying perilously close to TV-movie territory, this latest from Italian veteran Comencini manages to inject what sounds like an MOR textbook weepie, about the emotional toil of premature birth, with a serious dose of integrity and pathos. This is chiefly down to a very affecting and discreet performance from Buy as self-assured middle aged teacher Maria who is unable to hold down a relationship. Her life takes a turn for the existentially harrowing as another fleeting lover waves her goodbye and she finds herself alone and carrying child. After a needlessly baggy preamble, the focus sharpens in the second half as Maria is forced to take stock of her life and her future as her daughter spends a crucial two months inside an incubator. A little soapy, for sure, but it wont take much for you to succumb to the films life-affirming charms. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The classic French family drama gets a modern reboot in this unstoppably entertaining saga of life, love, death, pop music and an ongoing battle to cut down on the ciggies. Director Rmi Bezanons smart script selects one key day in the past for each member of a typical suburban household, building up a picture of what makes them tick and drives them mad, as both individuals and a unit. We start in 1988 on the day older brother Pio Marma leaves the nest, and by the time punkette sis Dborah Franois, stoic dad Jacques Gamblin (who still thinks hes a rebel, even though hes middle aged with three grown-up kids) and company make it to the millennium, we feel weve lived through it with them. Flawlessly acted, this film will prompt guffaws and nods of quiet recognition in equal measure, managing that rare trick of being accessible without dumbing down or turning naff. Richard Curtis, watch and weep.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Scarred and tattooed, the swashbuckling hero of this dark sword and sorcery movie bears the marks of his brutal life like stigmata; the impression left by British writer-director Michael J Bassetts monstrously entertaining action-adventure is just as indelible. Rather than adapt one of the Savage Tales of Solomon Kane written by Conan the Barbarian creator Robert E Howard, Bassett has created a character-driven yet action-packed origins story, one that traces his heros journey from bloodthirsty pirate through peaceful pilgrim to conflicted Puritan avenger  complete with cape, distinctive black hat, pistols and swords. James Purefoy is intensely charismatic as Kane, who, escaping the clutches of a soul-sucking demon, renounces violence. But when the Puritan family he befriends is slaughtered by the sorcerer Malachis disfigured henchman, he takes up the sword again, vowing to rescue their enslaved daughter Meredith (Rachel Hurd-Wood). Grounded in a believable sixteenth-century English milieu that sharpens rather than blunts its fantastical edge, the films epic vision bears comparison with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, its imaginative supernatural elements confidently fused with a savage reality.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Nick Twisp is confused. Hes a literate, Sinatra-loving sophisticate, so why does his virginity feel like a terminal affliction? Male adolescent ferment was ever thus, but leading man Michael Cera, as hes done in Superbad, Juno and Nick and Noras Infinite Playlist, brings a remarkably sympathetic presence to the travails of dweebdom. Whether you feel youve already seen Cera strut his geeky stuff once too often may well determine your reaction to this adaptation of CD Paynes cult novel, but its still passably diverting fare as he meets the girl of his dreams in the unlovely environs of the Restless Axles trailer park. She is Sheeni (Portia Doubleday), beautiful, a total Francophile, and has even heard of Yasujiro Ozu, but to be with her hes going to have to escape from home. Hes going to have to be a very bad boy.<br />Quite a challenge for the congenitally meek Nick, so he creates a moustachioed, Gauloise-puffing alter ego Franois Dillinger to say and do things he cant quite manage himself, setting in motion sundry jolly japes and escalating mayhem which complicate the pursuit of his affections. The tone throughout is moderately quirky rather than full-on teen-flick vulgarian, bolstered by indie-cred cameos from Steve Buscemi (his nervy dad) and Ray Liotta (his moms psycho-cop suitor), and garnished with cute animated interludes. A little of everything, actually, which almost disguises the fact that the movies not overly amusing, never truly insightful and trying rather too hard to be cultish. But we do like the Cera boy. We really do. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This wistful and amiable May-to-December romance sees glum college student Haru (Hikari Mitsushima) ditch her boorish boyfriend and embrace her inner lesbian. Once Haru is propositioned in a coffee shop by peppy prosthetic-limb maker Riko (Eriko Nakamura), its not long before the pair are feverishly texting each other trying to determine if this is The Real Deal. Avoiding the platitudes usually associated with the teens-in-love genre, debut director And Momoko is mindful of the small, private moments that can alert us of future disquiet within a relationship. It comes as little surprise that the film is adapted from a manga (by Erica Sakurazawa): the blunt, square-on shooting style and leisurely paced edits give the impression of scanning a comic book. And while the rambling story prevents it from being truly penetrating, the bittersweet tone and quiet performances make for a gratifying attempt to decipher the mysteries of love.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The Rape of Nanking in 1937 was a sign of things to come in World War II: an estimated 300,000 Chinese civilians were massacred by the Japanese army, and untold numbers of women and children subjected to relentless sexual abuse. Only one place in the city was safe: a weapons-free zone created and policed by a commitee of international residents under the direction of Siemens engineer and Nazi Party member John Rabe, from whose diaries this impressive but rather traditional film is adapted.<br />Its a terrific tale, competently told. But director Florian Gallenbergers script and direction are a touch schematic, while his international cast, including stern Ulrich Tukur as Rabe and Steve Buscemi as his sardonic American collaborator Wilson, appear to be going through the motions rather than getting to grips with the reality of the story. As a bank holiday war movie, City of War works fine. But doesnt the memory of those who died in Nanking  and those who struggled to help them  deserve better?]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Boots (Gary Stretch) is an ard case. We know this because: a) he beats a guy half to death in the first scene, b) hes not scared of Vinnie Jones and c) even though his mum and dad speak with middle-English accents and his brother is running for prime minister, he still talks like a no-shit toughnut of non-specific Northern origin. Its oversights like this that make The Heavy slightly more cackhandedly entertaining than the average unwatchable cockney gangland epic. The plot is risible, the dialogue ripe, the characters paper thin and painfully familiar. Its directed with clunky predictability and acted with all the subtlety and grace of an amateur dramatics production of Get Carter. But in the plus column, we get Vinnie sporting the most unintentionally hilarious goatee in ard-man history, and Lee Ryan from Blue convincing as a snivelling, effeminate lackey. Ryan is by far the best thing in the movie  which is as damning an indictment as I can imagine.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[French director Claire Deniss marvellous latest feature is a portrait of the close relationship between widowed Parisian train driver Lionel (Alex Descas) and his affectionate student daughter, Josphine (Mati Diop). Critics have welcomed it as both her warmest movie and, with its quiet observation of small ritual, her most affirmative and Ozu-esque. But though its true that 35 Shots demonstrates an extraordinary reflective ease and contains possibly more hugs and smiles than Deniss entire oeuvre to date, that is not to say it is a film free of tribulations, tensions and taboos.<br />The story is simple, a collection of scenes from the life of this small family who live in a flat in the Rue de la Guadeloupe, a little nest where Lionel escapes from the loneliness of his cab and the memory of his losses, and from which Josphine, inhibited from fullly developing her relationships with her neighbours, surrogate mother Gabrielle (Nicole Dogue) and suitor No (Grgoire Colin), must soon fly.<br /><br />From this, Denis magically evokes a liberal meditation on family, harmony, loyalty and belonging and their corollaries  loss, transgression, loneliness and separation  and achieves a sweet unity, not least through a beautifully discreet use of symbols, motifs and metaphors. Thus as cinematographer Agns Godards artful visual correspondences (an RER train and a block of flats shot at night) deepen an understanding of social context, the films various vehicles  Lionels train thundering into north Paris, his motorbike, the bicycle blocking the hallway  suggest not only specifics of occupation or class, but also journeys of different speeds. The films extraordinary economy is typified by a lovely, spontaneous caf scene where the principles dance to the Commodores Nightshift, a mini-ballet touchingly evocative of their separate feelings, relationships and destinies.]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[British writer-director-producer Peter Strickland has decamped to the Transylvanian countryside to fashion a moody and satisfyingly archaic debut drama about a scrawny, middle-aged mother whose sudden lust for vengeance is purely primal. The enigmatic Katalin Varga (Hilda Peter) is ostracised from her village and rejected by her loving husband when a horrid discrepancy from her past comes to light. Shedding no tears, she collects her son Orbn (Norbert Tanko), gathers up her few belongings and heads off on horse and cart to visit grandmother. The purpose of  and not to mention her violent commitment to  her mission becomes apparent late in the film, as a series of brutal encounters suggest that she may not be as mentally balanced as we initially assume.<br />Stricklands intricate screenplay thrives on not letting us see around the next corner until the very last moment  scenes are often trailed with mysterious preambles, such as when Katalin seduces a man around a campfire and then follows him to a bar before her intentions become clear. Visually, Strickland portrays the same, Romany milieu as Tony Gatlif does but clearly with his mind on the desolate landscapes of the American western. Technical flourishes, such as deploying dense soundscapes of white noise and ambient yelping, imbue unremarkable scenes with a brooding, ambiguous tension. Theres the occasional contrivance to shunt the story onwards, but its not enough to cloud the fact that Strickland and his star, Peter, have delivered a film of remarkable assurance and intensity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I feel that hes a self-hating Jew, says a childhood friend of Norman Finkelstein, the controversial author of 2000s <i>The Holocaust Industry </i>and a fierce critic of what he considers grief exploitation. Hes certainly a <i>Jew</i>-hating Jew. <br /></p><p>Other voices add to the complexity: an intellectual endorsement from former mentor Noam Chomsky (in a weird Kennedyesque photo, we see the two of them boating); a harsh slam from Harvards Alan Dershowitz, a sustained target of Finkelsteins critiques. Then theres the subject himself, the child of death-camp survivors. Unrepentant at the podium, he brings even mild-mannered Canadians to tears with his anti-Zionist screeds. Hes a bit of a showboat.<br /></p><p>With impressive restraint, the fascinatingly thorny<i> American Radical </i>is less interested in the validity of Finkelsteins ideasseriously mounted, if inflammatoryand more in the topsy-turvy life of todays professional academic. Amazingly, that choice doesnt result in a boring movie: We see student protests at Chicagos DePaul University in 2007 after Finkelstein is denied tenure (hes bounced among five different schools) and sit with the man in the back of a car as he wearily suggests that if his polemics were just about money, hed be smarter to change fields. His own worst enemy, Finkelstein has both trouble and tragic writ large on his brow.<br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The title of Pixars fabulous latest animation gives you its three elegantly dovetailed elements: rodents, food and French. Co-director Jan Pinkavas original idea was sweetly ridiculous  can a naive, ambitious rat (baby-eyed Remy, charmingly voiced by Patton Oswalt), long inspired by his reading of a famous French chefs recipe book, realise his dream to become a chef? This has been turned by its final director, Brad The Incredibles Bird, into one of the most witty, clever, gently moral, dramatically convincing and visually stimulating family entertainments of the year. The animation is extraordinary too, and occasionally breathtaking. Its so enticing, in fact, that card-carrying anti-anthropomorphists like this reviewer can readily accept its big ask: not only <br />a talking rodent but one able to make a celebrity chef out of his hopeless human helpmeet (the docile, disaster-zone Linguini, voiced by Lou Romano) by jerking his hair from inside his hat, like a Pinocchio pulling his masters strings. Its a tribute to the films tonal and directorial control, not to mention its sympathy, detail, intelligence and lack of pretension, that such subtextual sub-currents and metaphors  be they the immigrant experience  la American Tail, digs at McBurger food ethics or the assignation of artistic credit  never obscure its pleasures. Those pleasures are found in its vivid characters (such as its frightening Snow White-style villain, the power-crazed Anton Ego, a food critic with the features of a Gothic Will Self and the voice of Peter OToole), richness of ideas and daring sense of fun. A test for tiny tots, a mite nostalgic and as male-dominated as a modern kitchen it may be, but these are mere quibbles about this delightful addition to the Pixar pantheon.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Fashion is in right now, its appeal to a certain filmgoing demographic rivalled only by that of vampires. Its surprising that the two worlds havent yet collided on screen  Prada by Twilight, anyone? <br />In the meantime, RJ Cutlers documentary nods in that direction: focusing on Anna Wintour, the glacial editor of American Vogue, in the run-up to the publication of the magazines biggest ever September issue, it shows a business in which looks can kill even if fangs arent bared. (When Wintour is obliged to say excuse me to an assistant in her way, you fear the girls days are numbered.) <br />Longtime colleague Grace Coddington, the only person who talks back to her, provides a warmer foil, though the editor herself sometimes seems accessible, even vulnerable: Wintour may be a peerless titan in her field but her family view her work with amused indifference. Consistently funny and engaging, The September Issue is also a window onto the top echelon of an industry in which fanciful escapism is deadly serious.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Roman Polanskis last two films, Oliver Twist and The Pianist were solemn affairs, which is unsurprising, considering their stories. But theres often been a playful, comic side to his films, whatever their serious airs. Take a film like Frantic, his 1988 dash around Paris with a frazzled Harrison Ford and a wild Emmanuelle Seigner, and you can almost hear the giggles behind the Hitchcockian curtains. And 1992s Bitter Moon couldnt have been more ridiculously teasing in its charting of relationships between men and women. Even 1976s The Tenant, a spooky study in racial tension and mental disintegration, gave us Polanski wearing lipstick and a dress. Theres little more blackly comic than that.<br />The sniggers from the wings continue with The Ghost, an adaptation of Robert Harriss bold and enjoyable novel that balances political reality with trashy fantasy and which was inspired by the former journalists disappointment with Tony Blair. In Harriss hands, Blair becomes Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan), a slick but empty former prime minister facing trial for war crimes and hiding from the public glare in the United States. The similarities between Blair and Lang are pointed  but the differences are enough that Harris and Polanski get away with placing familiar characters in a tight and tense plot more wild than the dreary reality of high politics. The dreariness is left to the weather.<br />Starting in a wet London, we watch as a green writer (Ewan McGregor, better than usual but struggling with an Estuary accent) is hired to finish Langs memoirs. The last chap died on the job, so theres an ominous mood in the air as he travels to an isolated, modern beach house in a windswept Marthas Vineyard and finds an air of deep discord. Langs wife, Ruth (Olivia Williams, styled with nods to Cherie Blair), is a quietly forceful but sad figure behind the scenes, while Langs relationship with his assistant (Kim Cattrall) is causing tension. When Lang flies to Washington to try to rescue his reputation, his ghost begins to uncover secrets which contradict the Langs version of their past and put him in increasing danger.<br />Unlike, say, The Queen, which delighted in the ordinariness of what goes on behind powerful doors, Harris and Polanski delight in pushing their story beyond the bounds of reality  but never so far that the the film has no relevance. While Brosnans rictus performance is to be grinned at, the fabric of the film is grey, heavy and steely, demanding that we share the ghosts fear and take his peril seriously. As a thriller, the film is cold and lean, and the photography and design convey a strong sense of isolation and a world gone wrong. There are terrific scenes, not least one that involves a sat-nav guiding the action, and the films moody opening and closing scenes are as striking as the image Polanski creates of a weather-beaten coastline seen through the glass wall of Langs office.<br />Theres no escaping some laughable plot turns. Can you really unravel the CIA via Google? But the thread of black humour that runs throughout the film compensates for its occasional moments of madness. Its a film just silly enough to be taken deadly seriously.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In the summer of 2007, for reasons best known to themselves, The White Stripes embarked on a tour of every province and territory in Canada, from the relative balminess of British Columbia to the remote ice-plains of Nunavut, climaxing with a tenth anniversary show, complete with fiddles and bagpipes, in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia. What shines through in Under Great White Northern Lights is Jack and Meg Whites ongoing love for the music they make, and their playful eagerness to inject a touch of surreality into the drab monotony of touring. So we have shows in bowling alleys and town squares, on buses and boats in the harbour, not to mention an awkward meeting with the tribal elders of one far-flung principality. Enjoyment of the film depends a little on ones passion for the music, but even non-believers will warm to its frank, unfussy style and stunning location photography  in shades of black, white and red, natch.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Could this be the best film ever made about a national soup ban? Aardman alumni Sam Fell and Robert Stevenhagen bring old-fashioned fairy tale dynamics and an inviting fireside warmth to this adaptation of the bestselling childrens book by US author Kate DiCamillo. A lengthy prologue sets the scene, where the enquiring mind of ships rat Roscuro (Dustin Hoffman) gets the better of him on Soup Day, and he falls into the queens painstakingly concocted broth and causes her to die on the spot. By decree of the king, both soup and rats are outlawed, which draws a veil of gloom over the land and inadvertently spawns the ugly, underground Ratworld. Its up to tiny mouse, Despereaux (voiced by Matthew Broderick), to revive the fortunes of this once-picturesque township.<br /><br />Stylistically, the film uses brushed, pastel tones to reference classical painting, the most direct example of which is the Arcimboldo-inspired kitchen helper whose body consists of fruit and vegetables. Also, older viewers wont have to rely on another tired barrage of pop-cultural references, beat-boxing squirrels or hackneyed Shrekisms, and can instead grapple with the films surprisingly complex subtexts: ideas of regional conflict, unreasonable abuse of the law and political scaremongering.<br /><br />There are a few problems, mainly with the narrative which keeps doubling-back on itself to introduce new characters. And while its not animated with the breathless pizazz of a Pixar, Despereaux is all the more affecting and dramatically successful for its contemplative pace and measured delivery of information. A lovely film.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the Venice Film Festival 2009</i> <br />Did you hear the one about the German maverick who signed on to remake a notorious existential American policier and turned it into a stuffy, if pleasingly ridiculous b-picture? Werner Herzogs curious take on Abel Ferraras Bad Lieutenant received its premiere at the Venice Film Festival this morning, and as the curtains came down, there was the faint sound of booing to be heard amid the polite, cricket match-style applause. <br />Its certainly not a terrible film, but you get the sense that were Herzogs (currently invulnerable) name not attached, it would have been prime grist for the straight-to-DVD mill. Fragments and motifs from Ferraras original (which Herzog wryly stated he had not seen) remain, but for the most part, this is a much more conventional thriller: imagine a watered-down Aguirre: Wrath of God meets Antoine Fuquas Training Day. Gone are the sharp pangs of Catholic despair and the lengthy scenes of Harvey Keitel naked and weeping in front of a mirror. In their place, we have Nicolas Cage cackling maniacally, boasting about his lucky crack pipe and experiencing narcotic hallucinations of iguanas andbreakdancers? Redemption is strictly off the menu. <br />We open on Cages trivially crooked but essentially good-natured detective, Terrence McDonough, injuring himself while saving a Latino felon trapped inside some kind of bizarre underwater cage. Six months later, hes been promoted to Lieutenant and is indulging in white powder pick-me-ups as he goes about his rounds. Hes assigned to find the man who murdered five Senegalese illegal immigrants, and while he initially takes to the task with violent gusto, he soon becomes more interested in how hes going to pay his gambling debts, tend to the prostitute hes pimping (Eva Mendes in an extremely thankless role) and sneak drugs out of the police property room.<br />The build-up is slow and stiff. The affected, generic cop patter and humdrum camerawork are of the sort found in any trashy TV police procedural. Even the potentially rich political subtext of setting the film in post-Katrina New Orleans feels fumbled. The film only moves into the realms of eccentric brilliance on one occasion, in which a frazzled, three-day-bender Cage forces a nurse to talk by pulling the breathing tube from her elderly female patient's nose while screaming, I should kill you both, you fucks!, and claiming that theyre the reason why this country is going down the drain. Both women are agog. So, I imagine, were much of the audience.<br />Though ill-served by a simplistic storyline, Cages character does (just about) deserve to join the long and distinguished line of narcissistic and self-destructive Herzogian anti-heroes. He delivers an enjoyably barmy performance, spending the entire film in a billowy beige suit with a huge gun tucked brazenly down the front of his trousers. You could almost imagine Klaus Kinski playing him back in the day, but this new Bad Lieutenant doesnt contain the wit, insight or innovation you expect from Herzog. The occasional shot of ambiguity is injected into the mix  scenes were not quite sure are real or in Cages mind  but the remainder of the film is so unadventurous and unmemorable that it doesnt endear itself either intellectually or emotionally. And as Cage films go, this is one to file next to Vampires Kiss rather than Leaving Las Vegas.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Of all the dysfunctional, sociopathic loners in the long history of cinema, its hard to remember one quite as vicious, belligerent and unpredictable as Sang-hoon, anti-hero of Korean character actor Yang Ik-Junes crackling directorial debut. As played by the director, Sang-hoon is a dizzying, almost comically outrageous human tornado, every other word a curse, every other movement a fist in somebodys face. The impressive thing about Yangs movie is that you care for him.<br />The plot fits squarely into the single man finds companionship against his will template established by US indies like The Station Agent. Whats remarkable is how Yang approaches this potentially hackneyed narrative, balancing scenes of punishing, hyper-realistic violence with moments of sympathetic tenderness and dark, savage humour. Blending a thoughtful cycle-of-violence subplot with a piercing study of how even the most hateful and isolated people inevitably affect those around them, Breathless is a challenging, dynamic experience. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[There is a truly great comedy to be made about religion in modern Britain: the infighting, the backbiting, the doublethink and grandstanding, and of course the ordinary, everyday believers caught in the middle. Close-to-the-bone identity-swap tale The Infidel is not that film  but it comes damn close.<br />Stand-up comic Omid Djalili is Mahmud, a settled, non-practising Muslim family man whose life flips over when he discovers that not only was he adopted, but that his birth parents were orthodox Jews. Eager to learn more about his heritage, Mahmud turns to grouchy Jewish-American cab driver Lenny (Richard Schiff) for guidance.<br />The Infidel starts wonderfully, introducing us to a cast of carefully constructed stereotypes and then just as carefully it undermines them. Mahmud and Lenny are a terrific odd couple: theres a real bromantic spark between Djalili and Schiff, both of whom clearly relish the opportunity to tackle taboo subjects headon. David Baddiels script is sharp, wise and very funny, and never flinches from exposing the hypocrisy and power games that fuel religious intolerance.<br />But the film struggles to maintain this high standard. An intriguing but underdeveloped subplot concerning the marriage of Mahmuds son to the adopted daughter of a fundamentalist preacher begins to take over, pushing poor Lenny into the background and breaking up the perfectly pitched buddy dynamic that fuelled the earlier scenes. And gradually, inevitably, it drifts into worthiness: Baddiel doesnt just want us to laugh, he wants us to learn. And here lies the films downfall, as what began as a smart, challenging exercise in boundary pushing becomes just another sentimental life lesson.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This is one of those rare occasions where the sequel is better than the original  but only by a whisker. In the first instalment, Alex the dancing lion and his mismatched cohorts escaped from a New York zoo on a mission to reach Africa. They missed and wound up on Madagascar instead. Roll on part two and Alex (voice of Ben Stiller) et al are on board a home-made aircraft bound for Africa where they hope finally to meet members of their own species. The film then shatters into a trillion plotlets involving reunions, rites of passage, water shortages, volcanic sacrifices, even a little romantic interaction. Yet, despite this splintered storyline, the film manages to remain more coherent than the last. The animation, too, is improved. Great pre-Chrimbo fun for under-tens, then, but a chore for anyone else. Tip: for best results, see it in gigantiscope at the IMAX.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its been more than a decade since Justin Kerrigans debut, Human Traffic, and the Welsh director finally returns to cinemas with with this sparky, moving and very personal film that draws on his own memories of growing up in the 1980s. Most dads are heroes in the eyes of their boys, even if everyone else thinks theyre raving lunatics, and thats the idea explored in this clever and sensitive film about Charlie (Robert Carlyle), a spiv-like figure who darts about his rundown Welsh neighbourhood in 1988 as if hes being chased by an unknown enemy and confides in his 11-year-old son Jamie (Arron Fuller) that hes working for the Secret Services. That hes probably not Port Talbots answer to 007 is clear early on, but Kerrigan is brave enough to allow the truth to emerge gradually over an entire film.<br />All of which leaves the director ample room to explore at close quarters, and from a peculiar and rewarding perspective, the relationship between this father and son. Its a film told largely through careful performances, and Fuller is excellent as the boy, capturing both the wide-eyed, loyal acceptance of a young son who wants to believe anything and everything his father says and the protective instinct of a child of a vulnerable parent. Carlyle, meanwhile, gives one of his best performances as the troubled and hyperactive father, further proving that he has excellent taste when picking smaller British films (Summer, The Unloved). Modest in means but rich in warmth, its an eminently likeable film and all credit to Kerrigan for finding a new way of exploring the age-old story of dads and their boys.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Audiences know what theyre getting with the annual Big Disney Christmas Movie: heroic kids, evil adults, and a bumbling hero caught somewhere in between. This years chump is Adam Sandler, essaying his usual bipolar man-child schtick as Skeeter Bronson, the handyman at a grand hotel built on the site of the Mom n Pop motel where he grew up, who is nonplussed when the tales he concocts for his niece and nephew begin to have eerie parallels in real life.<br />Bedtime Stories starts well, with Sandlers naturally acerbic persona and wilfully erratic turns from Guy Pearce and Russell Brand serving to offset the scripts more schmaltzy moments. But it descends into pathos, undermined by an insipid romantic subplot and the usual platitudinous guff about self-belief. Insult is added to injury by a series of reactionary, misinformed anti-eco gags and a distressing but inevitable cameo from Rob Schneider as a Native American.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Click here to read a interview with director Campion</i><br />Not a great deal happens in Bright Star, Jane Campions breezy and beautiful film about the nineteenth-century British poet John Keats (played by Ben Whishaw). The New Zealand directors film is light in the most attractive and dreamy of ways: it floats on its own, intimately explored love story and refuses to be weighed down by either period fixtures and fittings or the later reputation of Keats, whose final years and stalling romance with his neighbour Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish) Campion handles with a smartness and sensitivity that feel teasingly throwaway.<br /><br />Thats not to say theres anything slapdash about Campions story of how Keats moved in next door to the fatherless Brawne family and fell in love with slightly younger Fanny, tentatively courting her and writing her wonderfully honest letters but fatally kept at a distance by poverty and illness. In fact, for this critic, its the exquisite detail of the whole affair, coupled with the aerating winds of modernity that blow gently through the film, rather than the emotional pull of the doomed love affair at its heart, that are the films real success. (Others, I must say, differ on this point, judging by the sobs and sniffles to my left and right at the London Film Festival screening of the film.) <br />A combination of unstuffy dialogue, wise casting, unselfconscious performances and sensuous but never pretty photography makes Campions version of the nineteenth century feel current but not anachronistic.<br />Campion came to Keatss story, which she shot in Britain last year, after a four-year sabbatical from filmmaking  and it shows, especially following the dark, oppressive atmosphere of In the Cut, one of her least successful films. Her telling of this biographical tale, inspired by Andrew Motions biography, feels as if its told by someone with much knowledge but little weight on their shoulders. Its a feeling one gets from the performances too, especially from Cornish and Whishaw, who both, at times, threaten to float off on a cloud of their characters distraction. Its down to the side players, especially an earthy Kerry Fox as Fannys mother and a boisterous Paul Schneider as Keatss friend and protector Charles Brown, to give the film some vim away from the fog of love. Whishaw, with his troubled air and vulnerable features, is perhaps better as a Romantic lead than a romantic one, and if the film has one crucial failing, its that theres a crucial spark missing between Whishaw and Cornish. <br />Campion treats Keatss talent as a given and not a cue for creaky explorations of inspiration and artistic otherness. She weaves his poetry into the drama, calling for it to be spoken naturally and not at all awkwardly by her characters. Its not easy to follow verse this way, but it certainly inspires the viewer to head straight from the cinema to the bookshop.<br /><i>Click here to read a interview with director Campion</i><br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It makes a change to see a 3D animated kids film that doesnt poke your eyes out with fancy effects just for the sake of it. In fact, some of the 3D elements in Blue Skys latest prehistoric critter circus are so subtle you may not notice them. What you wont miss are the films exhilarating action sequences and electrifyingly vibrant palette.<br /><br />Some dramatic changes are occurring in the lives of Manny the mammoth, Sid the sloth and Diego the sabre-toothed tiger. Manny is preoccupied with a pregnant partner, Diegos lost his mojo and is having a midlife crisis, and lisping loser Sid well, is it any wonder he doesnt have a family of his own? Following a minor tiff, Sid wanders off, falls through the ice and discovers three dinosaur eggs which he adopts  until big mama Rex comes trundling into the frame. In a nod to Journey to the Centre of the Earth, the rest unfolds in a Cretaceous underworld where Manny and Co  aided by a cocky new weasel character  attempt an audacious rescue. <br />Some have expressed displeasure at the design and voices of the leads. I disagree  but I do think Simon Peggs Artful Dodger-like weasel is a vocal clich too far. Similarly, some of the anarchic, comical segues featuring Scrat the squirrel and a newfound love are beginning to feel overfamiliar. As with the two earlier films, its all a mite disorderly in tempo but often highly amusing and great fun in the main.]]></review>

Adopting the same muted approach to drama as his previous films (Funny Ha Ha and Mutual Appreciation), Beeswax revolves around a trifling dispute between the patrons of a vintage clothing store in Austin, Texas as the slyly combative Amanda (Anne Dodge) plans to take the partially disabled Jeanie (Tilly Hatcher) to court. More than ever, Bujalski comes across like the natural heir to someone like Eric Rohmer, an artist who creates intricate, perceptive and artful cinema that rejects unnecessary style and contrivance. Also like Rohmer, this is a film about how language lacks the capabilities to convey the complexity of human feeling and that we have to look beyond what characters are saying to decode their thoughts and intentions.]]></review>

Hayes and Burley offer spirited performances, but, if Heymann and writer Leigh Campbell had held back their narrative cards a little more, this could have been a much more credible exploration of teenage sexual infatuation.

      <review><![CDATA[Maozs gruelling winner of Venice Golden Lion is a blood, sweat and soup-smeared purging of graphic personal memories from his stretch in the Israeli infantry during the catastrophic 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Innovatively capturing the lunacy and inscrutability of urban warfare, the story is told almost entirely from the soiled helm of a lumbering tank, as four beleaguered and naive young recruits frenetically react to orders barked at them from superiors while trying to maintain some semblance of hierarchy and sanity. This voyeuristic view of combat scores big for formal audaciousness but also carries an interesting (if hardly original) intellectual depth concerning the psychological brutalisation of innocent soldiers. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Heres another pathologically pleasant melodrama from Lasse Hallstrm (Hachi: A Dogs Tale); this one is adapted from a weepy by Nicholas Sparks, author of The Notebook and Nights in Rodanthe, so comes infected with a fatal strain of Sunday school sanctimony. Its an elegantly doomed love story with Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia!): a couple so wholesomely, handsomely American they ought to come with a made-by-Mattel stamp.<br />He is a soldier on leave from the Green Berets visiting his awkward coin-collecting dad; shes a student. They meet on a beach in South Carolina. Cue a two-week romance filmed something like a feminine hygiene advert: sunshiny and breezy, his bronzed beefcake chest, her lithe limbs. Theres some coy intimate relations and seriously articulate lets-make-the-world-a-better place chats. She tells him she wants to set up a summer camp for kids with autism; hes only got a year left to serve. They promise to write. Its all looking peachy. At which point you expect one of them to pipe up: Gee, arent we meant to be, like, elegantly doomed or something?<br />Enter 9/11, rudely upsetting the course of true love. He re-enlists for another tour, she waits. War, death, illness, this film has its fair share of all three. Which, never mind anything so complicated as grief or post-traumatic stress, provide ample opportunity for great swells of goodness and beatific smiles; even the Dear John letter of the title is written in an act of heroic self-sacrifice. A sucker for a cheap sob, it left me cold.]]></review>

for hours, and drink up her every self-deprecating zinger like freshly
brewed espresso. (As for the others who dont get herwe understand
Sarah Palin has a new show.) Still, theres no reason Fey, so dynamic
on the small screen, has to get Anistoned out of a proper Hollywood
crossover. <i>Baby Mama</i> (2008) was cringingly mediocre; indeed, one has to cast back to 2004s tangy, Fey-scripted <i>Mean Girls</i> to get a reasonable glimmer of her talent. Even then, we were still watching Lindsay Lohan.</p><p><i>Date Night</i>
isnt going to alter this conundrumit makes you laugh in fits and
starts, but more often it feels toothless and exhausted, the kind of
project that exists to give Ray Liotta work. (The generic script is by <i>Shrek</i>-sequel
scribe Josh Klausner.) Fey is almost perfectly paired with Steve Carell as
bored, married New Jerseyites Claire and Phil: The way they trade quips
and cast snide aspersions at strangers, the actors seem totally
believable as intellectual mates and, more crucially, deeply in danger
of losing intimacy. After stealing a reservation at a clichd-snobby
NYC eatery, the couple are mistaken for blackmailers and pursued by
goons, <i>North by Northwest</i>style, throughout the city.</p><p>You
know where this is going; shouty misadventures in a slow-moving
motorboat, a clamorous car chase and an exclusive sex club will surely
move them out of the most excellent roommates category. When Mark Wahlberg
shows up as a shirtless tech-heavy spyone who can also flirt in

Forensic psychiatrist Dr Cara Jessup (Julianne Moore), a doctor of science and a woman of God, is dedicated to debunking the myth of multiple-personality disorders. Her testimonies have sent murderers to their deaths, so she is intrigued when her father, a shrink, invites her to consider the fractured mind of a new patient, Adam (Jonathan Rhys Myers). Not even the random murder of her husband could shake Jessups belief in science and her faith in God, but Adams dislocated mind comes close. Suddenly, rationality gives way to doubt, as Jessup starts to believe that Adams alternate personalities are murder victims, connected in some way to an early-twentieth-century flu epidemic, some devil-worshipping mountain gypsies and a false prophet. Moore and Rhys-Meyers act as if theyre possessed, but no one can arrest the films slide into noisy, supernatural nonsense.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>British viewers can only witness  and not fully appreciate  Michael Moores Sicko, so strongly is his latest slice of peppy agitprop intended for folk in his own land. This cant be stressed too much. For if anyone in these isles mistook Moores new film for a balanced, erudite essay on the American healthcare system , they could rightly accuse Moore of distortion, self-aggrandisement, emotional blackmail and all the other qualities that weve come to know  and love  from Moores particular brand of filmmaking. As it is, you suspect that Sicko has all these elements in droves, yet still youre glad that the film exists and may even find yourself cheering or shedding a tear at its more demagogic moments. Its only later, when you emerge into the light, that you find yourself hurriedly adjusting your trousers and a small amount of guilt starts to flow.</p><p>Sicko is a quieter, more focused and less feral beast than its predecessor, Fahrenheit 9/11, but thats not saying much. Moore takes 50 minutes to lumber into view, which, on a first viewing of the film, I took for a new modesty. Most probably, though, Moores early absence  the voiceover is very much his own  is for other reasons; he must find it more difficult to film in public these days.</p><p>One also wonders: has he come to depend more heavily now on other interviewers and researchers than his own legwork? Whatever the methods, the point of the film is a strong one, well-made: the profit-motive of American health insurance is killing people. Moore sidesteps the issue of millions of Americans not even being able to afford proper insurance and instead fires unease straight into the heart of employed, financially comfortable, secure middle-America. Moore presents case after case of those who have suffered from insurance companies finding ways to wriggle out of the deal. Hes good on the underlying values of the system too, offering an amusing episode in which he traces the roots of the reds-under-the-bed fears against socialised medicine, even tracking down a 12-inch record that Ronald Reagan made to help the cause.</p><p>Its when Moore crosses the pond and starts to compare the American situation with the perceived Nirvana of the British and French systems that any European viewer will have to start biting their tongue and chanting: this is meant for less-intelligent Americans, less-intelligent Americans, less-intelligent Americans . . . for whom the entire concept of free healthcare was always demonised as a Soviet method of mind-control. Of course, as we know, our NHS has its own problems, but theyre not Moores concern: why ruin a good rant? Mostly, Moore keeps to his simple, but important, task of comparing the benefits of government-run healthcare with that operated by private enterprise and destroying some popular myths about socialised medicine. The films worst chapters come at the end with two very stupid stunts, one involving a trip to Cuba and another involving Moore footing the medical bill for the wife of a vocal critic.So familiar now is Moores heavy-handed style of persuasion that when a film called Manufacturing Dissent arrived in our cinemas last week and accused him of distorting one of the central thrusts of Roger &amp; Me, his film about unemployment in Flint, most critics were willing to shrug their shoulders with a resounding, Aw, shucks. We shouldnt be so complacent: a good cause doesnt justify iffy means. Yet you would have to be very naive to watch Moores films, this one included (which is less obviously wild and hysterical), and not see through his methods. In fact, thats part of the pleasure; a groan here, a heartfelt nod there. And, for us Brits at least, Sicko is worth it just for the sight of Moore wandering around Hammersmith Hospital looking for the cash till.</p>]]></review>

      <name><![CDATA[Life During Wartime]]></name>
      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the Venice Film Festival 2009</i> <br />Many may see the latest from American provocateur Todd Solondz as something of a cop out because, a decade later, he has chosen to revisit the characters from his most popular and emotionally incisive film, Happiness. Call it a sequel if you will, but more crucially, call it a withering and spitefully funny return to form for this one-of-a-kind writer-director. <br />Life During Wartime is a rigorously intelligent and reflective Buuelian satire, and like Solondz's previous two films, Storytelling and Palindromes, it takes a single idea  here,the concept of forgiving and forgetting  and probes it from a number of deliciously absurd angles.<br />Three sisters, Joy (Shirley Henderson), Trish (Allison Janney) and Helen (Ally Sheedy), all strive for bourgeois normalcy while their human relationship skills and ability to adopt rational political ideals are lacking. Happiness left us in an abyss of hope, as prim housewife Trish discovered that her husband was a paedophile, writer Helen was suffering from depression having foolishly accepted the advances of a perverted stalker, and Joy, well, she was starting to get wise to the fact that people were taking cruel advantage of her genial demeanour. The film joins the characters a few years down the line, and the tragic news is, not much has changed. It asks, can we ever really put our past failures behind us? It also asks, can we ever put the past failures of others behind us?<br />As in Happiness, Solondz takes straight-aim at middle-class hypocrisy, inadequate parenting, therapist doubletalk and a sickeningly quaint service-driven society that does its best to assure us that everything is okay. His weapon of choice is the one-on-one conversation and he draws much of the comedy and pathos from how two people interact in private discourse. Of course, Solondz is deviously mining for the comedy of discomfort, and in such scenes where Trishs curious 12-year-old son asks her what anal rape is (having just discovered the truth about his father), he strikes pure gold. The writing is mostly exceptional. <br />Formally, this is Solondz's most conventional film since Happiness, and even though the dramatic arc is extremely slight, the thematic undertow is always tight and compelling. The director uses flashbacks, dreams and visions to let us know whats going on inside the characters heads, but those are his biggest visual extravagances. His greatest coup  and perhaps one that other viewers may disagree with  is how he is able to pile flaws and quirks on to his characters without ever reducing them to mere pawns in his wicked game. He likes them, and he wants us to like them too. <br />None of the actors from Happiness return for this film, which at one point was mooted to have Paris Hilton among its cast (shes not). But that doesnt prevent it from working just as smoothly. Janney and Henderson are particularly strong, as is Michael K Williams (better known as Omar from The Wire) showing that hes no one trick pony as Joys perverted, criminally-inclined husband, Allan. Ciarn Hinds, too, manages to step in to the boots of the empathetic paedophile that actor Dylan Baker made so memorable in the earlier film.<br />In the end, though, this is Solondzs film, and with it, he has proven once again what a gifted and astute filmmaker he really is.  <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[It all started in a dentists waiting room in France, with a magazine feature on a New York construction whose twin towers would absolutely dwarf the Eiffel Tower. The teenage Philippe Petit was so entranced, he ripped the article out and stuck it up his jumper. He dreamed right then of walking on a wire between what would become the two towers of the World Trade Center, and, in 1974, he actually did it.<br />Just how this act of graceful insanity came to pass is chronicled in Marshs captivating documentary, which intercuts the build-up and execution of the walk itself with Petits remarkable backstory. This was no spur-of-the-moment fluke, but the result of years of globe-trotting preparation with a support group of like-minded individuals, each of whom pop up in interviews to express awe-struck concern for their fearless leader. Petit himself twinkles here too, exuding such voluble Gallic esprit that he could hold us in his spell for 90 minutes on his own.<br />Not that seeing the man himself detracts from the palm-slicking suspense the film develops as the mission hits almost surreal snags even before the soon-to-be-famous funambulist steps out on to the thinnest thread. Nor, indeed, does the absence of surviving locations knock Marsh off his stride as he contrives sequences of playful dramatic fakery to sustain the tension. Although some viewers may find the too-familiar Michael Nyman cues and over-used Erik Satie pianism a disappointingly earthbound musical accompaniment, for the most part theres storytelling magic here which makes the film so much bigger than just some expert BBC-funded reconstruction. Theres no mention of the buildings subsequent fate; instead, a generous, visionary gesture supplanting the communal memory of the sites unspeakable horrors with an image of human achievement thats head-spinning, heart-leaping in its absurd purity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Greek provocateur Lanthimos plays psychological conditioning for twisted laughs in this ingeniuous and shockingly blunt satire on the nuclear family which inhabits a world thats suggestive of a latter-day Buuel film peopled by mini Kaspar Hausers. A happily married factory worker takes his duties as a father (of two twentysomething daughters and one son) to extreme measures by forbidding them to leave their sprawling homestead and strictly monitoring any interaction they have with the outside world. The geometric framing and odd, almost robotic performances place this in the realms of science fiction more than human drama, but its insights into the anomalies of power, influence and manipulation are penetrating to say the least. Highly recommended. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The Manchurian Candidate raises the same red flags today as it did in the early 1960s, when its story of political intrigue and assassination became all too relevant following the death of JFK, causing the films abrupt disappearance from screens. Re-released to coincide with the current election campaign, it remains a nightmarish tale of high-level subterfuge, mental manipulation and the futility of one mans rebellion against an ingrained social system. <br />In one of his last roles as a genuine actor before he was swallowed by shallow fame, Frank Sinatra stars as disturbed Korean war veteran Bennett Marco, who uncovers a plot to murder a presidential frontrunner. One of the first films to voice the growing belief that the American system of power and privilege was corrupt, it prefigures not just the Kennedy and King murders, but Vietnam, Watergate and the entire 70s conspiracy boom. More importantly, its a sensational piece of genre filmmaking: pacy, compelling, witty and cynical, it depicts, in unflinching detail, the beginning of the end for post-war American optimism.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Before Ghost Town was released in the US, writer-director David Koepp suggested that he had doubts whether Ricky Gervais would be able to carry the project. Its an odd remark, especially when Gervais is the last person who should be blamed for the films failings. Assuming his usual guise as the jittery, acid-tongued malcontent, he excels as a dentist with the Groucho-esque moniker of Bertram Pincus. He dies for seven minutes during a colonoscopy and, on leaving hospital, is able to see members of NYCs dead who have business to attend to in the land of the living. The spirit of a city slicker played by Greg Kinnear railroads him into stopping his graceful other half (Ta Leoni) marrying a smug lawyer, but when Pincus gets to know her, well, you can guess the rest <br />Its not unlikeable  but no effort has been made to make anything more of the Scrooge-comes-good model. Gervaiss sweetly pathetic performance masks many of the failings of the by-the-book quirky direction and workaday script, but Leoni is decent as the romantic foil  and Kinnears slimy-everyman act works well. Enjoyable as it is to see Gervais trying (and often succeeding) to make something of the mediocre dialogue, its not enough.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[When Cormac McCarthys brutal saga of post-apocalyptic angst won the Pulitzer Prize in 2007, a big screen adaptation became inevitable. Whether or not this was a good idea seemed irrelevant: it was a bestselling book with a timely, inherently cinematic theme; the movie had to be made. <br /> The Proposition director John Hillcoats film is as direct and unflinching an adaptation as one could reasonably hope for. A man (Viggo Mortensen) and a boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee) wander the American wasteland after an unnamed ecological disaster. The trees are bare, the animals dead, the few human survivors starving, desperate, often violent, occasionally monstrous.The Road is certainly the bleakest and potentially the least commercial product in recent Hollywood history. Both book and movie suffer from the same inherent weakness  they exist purely to make you miserable. Sure, theres a smattering of subtext  a little eco-politics here, a spot of family psychology there  but the central purpose is to break your heart and shatter your soul.<br />On which level, Hillcoats movie is a resounding triumph. Stunning landscape photography sets the melancholy mood, and Nick Caves wrenching score reinforces it. But it is the performances that ultimately hold the film together. We expect this kind of selfless professionalism from Mortensen, and McPhee is appropriately sad-eyed as his long-suffering son, but its the incidental characters who steal the show, notably Robert Duvall in a startling cameo which not only distils the films key themes into a single three-minute scene, but singlehandedly lifts a potentially drab affair into something quietly impressive. Just dont expect to walk out smiling.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Capitalisms knack of rewarding the innovative while penalising the vulnerable is the central theme of this spry comedy from British director Ben Hopkins about a small-time gamble gone sour. Its set in 1994 and takes place in a string of villages near the Turkey/Azerbaijan border. Tayan Ayaydin plays luckless Mihram, an independent, charismatic blackmarket trader who sees potential for a payout in a request from a clinic to smuggle pharmaceuticals into Turkey, and far from being the altruistic soul his wife perceives, he plans to boost his capital by folding in other business. There are moments when Hopkins loses sight of the drama in his attempt to construct an economic case study, but the film is full of enough humour, charm and intelligence to forgive it this minor sin.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Although made for television and already transmitted on C4, actress Samantha Mortons directorial debut definitely has a cinematic feel. Long unflinching takes, imposing frontal compositions and expressive use of colour and sound mark this portrait of the institutional care which fails 11-year-old Lucy (Molly Windsor, pictured) after she can no longer live with her estranged parents (Robert Carlyle, Susan Lynch). Given Mortons own troubled personal history, theres obviously an autobiographical element here, yet its remarkable how she sublimates any residual anger into the films sombre and sincere accumulation of detail, which illustrates camaraderie and rebellion, unwitting neglect and  sadly  manipulative abuse within the clinical environs of a Nottingham childrens home. Windsors taciturn and stoic central performance is both haunting and affecting, framed by Mortons deliberate, even stately direction. Thankfully though, this isnt a conventional film, but a campaigning document, an act of solidarity and a bold, emotionally piercing personal statement.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Why make a kiddie movie about investment banking? Especially when it suggests that the perpetrators of the credit crunch were spending too little  not too much  time listening to their seven year olds. Thats exactly what Denver exec Eddie Murphy does in this dreadfully flat family comedy, since the financial advice of his daughter (Yara Shahidi, a natural) and her imaginary friends rather spookily outdoes his own market soothsaying. Needless to say, he becomes reliant on her suggestions, with consequences that leave yawning gaps between anything even vaguely resembling a half-smile, as the plot grinds its way towards some chastening lessons for workaholic daddy.<br /><br />Murphy at least tries to stay in character rather than overdoing the silly voices and physical knockabout, but maybe the material was so blah that he felt it wasnt worth the effort. So there you have it, a movie in which the innocence of a child helps her parent become a better capitalist, all to the strains of sundry Beatles covers. Does one detect just the teeniest hint of cynicism? <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its tempting to see this debut feature from the creators of The Office and Extras as a case of poachers turned gamekeepers: all those gags about pop culture and Hollywood, then they go and make a straight-down-the-line coming-of-age yarn, set in the most romantically realised version of 1973 Reading you could imagine. In fact, the seeds were always there: the confidently sustained story, the build-up of emotional resonance and the parochial aspirationalism that characterise Cemetery Junction are all of a piece with the writer-directors sitcom work.<br />The film focuses on three lifelong pals entering adulthood: Bruce (Tom Hughes) is all swaggering bravado; Snork (Tom Doolan) is a clown, alternately arrogant and naively inane; and apprentice insurance salesman Freddie (Christian Cooke) is knuckling down to a life of bourgeois comfort he hasnt quite sold himself on yet. He finds a kindred spirit in childhood crush Julie (Felicity Jones), whose slimy dad (Ralph Fiennes) and fianc (Matthew Goode)  Freddies boss and mentor at the insurance firm  have decidedly lower opinions of her potential.<br />There are laughs, but this isnt quite a comedy. Gervais and Merchant have stated their intention to make a classically cool movie along the lines of Saturday Night Fever or Rebel Without a Cause and they get away with it up to a point. Rather than sniggeringly naff, their 70s suburbia is handsomely designed and lit, with attractive, engaging kids undergoing unabashedly emotional life-changes.<br /><br />Its not a wholly convincing fit: though confidently executed, the film often leans heavily enough on its models to feel formulaic, and its romances map a little too closely on to those of The Office. Overall, though, its refreshing to see a mainstream British film with the ambition to strut its stuff on studio terms. Aspirational indeed.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[In 1937, facing an advancing Japanese army, the Chinese government withdrew from the then capital Nanking (now known as Nanjing). Although some in Japan still dispute the facts, the ensuing occupation saw the Japanese military shooting many thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians and committing rape on a massive scale, while the populace took refuge in the diplomatic quarter. Filmed in black-and-white on huge sets recreating the bomb-blasted city, Lu Chuans dramatised account lacks nothing in vividness, elaborating the scale of the atrocities through witnesses on both sides. With a key role for a Japanese soldier disgusted by the carnage, the film discerns the humanity of patriots and enemy alike, though the emphasis is on the heroic sacrifices of the Chinese. Even if the characterisation is a shade too generic to engage the emotions, and its hard to respond to savagery on this scale, the fact that these events are being brought to light with such care makes this a significant film  though not a great one.]]></review>

Perhaps the biggest mistake is to have made Eliza a writer: working motherhood is always fraught, but the profession where you open your laptop once the rugrats are out of the way is easier than many. <br />But frankly, I wouldnt care if she was at the epicentre of the movement for global peace: shes a happily married mother who looks like Uma Thurman, and my reserves of sympathy are limited.]]></review>

Forget it  this nasty non-thriller shares nothing but a similar title with Alex Coxs nutty 1984 head trip through LA, and mores the pity. Here, were in that gone-to-pot near-future so beloved of filmmakers, where Law and Whitaker (pictured) are pals and colleagues working in a debt-recovery department with a difference: they recover human organs. The film pitches friend against friend as Law ends up with a new ticker and darts about town with fellow post-op target Alice Braga in tow. Ideas, excitement and logic are ditched in favour of blood and gore  and theres no fun to be had watching operations and knife fights. Law and Whitaker are disastrous in the lead roles. Its a dreary and violent film that betrays its three years spent on the shelf.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[At first glance, Bananas!* seems like just the latest in a long line of agit-prop docs warning consumers off their favourite foodstuffs. Opening scenes of desolate Nicaraguan villages and downtrodden workers only reinforce this impression. Then were introduced to Juan J Dominguez, a sparkly-toothed LA legal eagle who drives a Ferrari, has a bust of Caesar on his desk and speaks passionately of his feelings towards the little guy, and matters become more unpredictable. Essentially, Bananas!* (theres no clue given as to what the asterisk signifies) is a David and Goliath legal drama, following Juan and his colleagues as they bring a case against food giant Dole for the mistreatment of Nicaraguan workers in the late 70s. Its a low-budget, off-the-cuff affair, relying largely on grainy court footage and to-camera interviews, and is probably better suited to TV than the big screen. But there are moments of real suspense, and the films intentions  to publicise the still-raging workers battle  is a noble one.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The story was already old-fashioned in 1948: budding prima ballerina Victoria (Moira Shearer) finds herself torn between the divergent demands of art and heart, as represented by two equally headstrong men  tortured control freak and impresario Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) and lovelorn composer Julian (Marius Goring). When they put aside their differences and collaborate, they produce work of awe-inspiring beauty, but ultimately the simmering tension between them leads to tragedy.<br /></p><p>The realisation that were in the presence of genius comes just a few minutes into The Red Shoes, as a gaggle of eager balletomanes take their places for the inaugural performance of Lermontovs latest masterpiece. They settle into their seats, the roar around them fades, a cheery onscreen ticker reads 45 minutes later, and Michael Powell moves us forward in time without even breaking the shot.These quietly radical directorial flourishes can be found throughout the film and Powells entire canon  but what sets this greatest of all British filmmakers apart from the competition is his refusal to thrust his genius in the audiences face, subsuming his natural showmans flair to the demands of story and character. <br />Until the time comes to cut loose, at which point Powell unleashes the most eyepopping visual extravaganza imaginable. Blending impressionist art and expressionist film, blurring the barriers between theatre and cinema, body and camera, reality and dream, drawing equally on the avant-garde and the classical, the centrepiece ballet is a sequence of sheer, reckless transcendence. Its here that The Red Shoes becomes more than the sum of its hoary old parts, taking flight as the crowning glory of our national cinema.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Let nobody claim that Jim Jarmusch isnt a grand master of the ironic Zen shaggy-dog caper, in that every one of his eccentric films features bewildered men (rarely women) ambling down the road less travelled to locations of unclear significance. With The Limits of Control, his ode to John Boormans stark 1967 revenge thriller Point Blank, he has delivered a work of dazzling formal discipline that riffs on the simple notion of repetition and variation. <br />The films succession of cryptic encounters  involving Isaach de Bankol as a steely, Melvillian lone gunman on a mission in Spain  feel more like painstakingly sculpted stanzas of a poem than they do twists in some contrived yarn. Certainly, some will find Jarmuschs convention-bending games a little testing, but in craftily withholding so much information about where were headed (or, indeed, where weve come from), he forces us to work harder to find meaning in the films ambiguities. Why does De Bankol keep visiting that gallery? Why does he always order two single espressos? What do the absurd outpourings of the supporting players  a white-haired Tilda Swinton musing on films and dreams, a scraggy John Hurt discussing the derivation of the term bohemian, etc  actually mean? <br />Jarmusch takes great pleasure in daring us to suppress our expectations of where pulp genre films are supposed to take us and the emotional cues theyre supposed to house. Being black, celibate and monosyllabic, De Bankols criminal operative inverts all the usual trappings of the traditional screen gangster, and once you apply that rule to everything within the films exotic, strangely logical world (beautifully photographed by Chris Doyle), then its point will become clear.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This ghostly, semi-improvised guided tour through the shell-damaged streets of Beirut and the countryside of southern Lebanon soon after the bombings of summer 2006 offers a candid prcis on the human cost of war. It also weighs up the relative merits of documentary and fiction filmmaking within such a sensitive context. <br />Playing herself, Catherine Deneuve is the guest of honour at a gala dinner in Beirut, but first she asks if she can be driven around the area to witness the devastation firsthand. She strikes up a fond rapport with French-speaking Lebanese actor Rabih Mrou who is her chauffeur as they travel through the rubble. <br />Husband-and-wife team Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige capture their meandering conversations but also ensure the wider tragedy is present, whether in glassy shots of the sprawling wreckage or as reflections in the car windows. They never take full dramatic advantage of the situation (as Philippe Aractingi did in 2007 with Under the Bombs), and theres no denying that this is a single-note film, but its a note of considerable emotional clout.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Click here to read our interview with the director of 'Mid-August Lunch'</p><p>Its no secret that many Italian men stay at home with mamma until they get married, or at least until mamma finally kicks them out into the big, bad world. But this low-key Italian charmer, which is more of a touching, humorous short story than a fully fleshed novel, takes that idea to extreme lengths. Writer-director Gianni Di Gregorio (one of the writers on last years Gomorrah, but dont expect any guns here) plays Gianni, a placid Roman in his fifties who lives with his elderly mum Valeria (Valeria De Franciscis), a refined 80 year old who always looks like shes dressed for dinner at the Ritz back in 1963.<br /><br />This loving pair live in a comfortable city-centre apartment, surrounded by good furniture and knickknacks accumulated over many years, but we know they have little cash as the manager of their building comes knocking, wondering when theyre going to pay their service charges. In place of a cheque, Gianni agrees to look after the managers mother for the weekend. However, when the mother, Grazia, turns up, she has another relative, Maria, in tow. Within hours, Gianni has also agreed to take care of Marina, his doctors mother, which means hell be spending the mid-August holiday (ferragosto) in the company of four women with a combined age of around 350.<br /><br />Its a bit of a stretch to call this a comedy, even though it puts a warm grin on your face from beginning to end. The real beauty of the film lies in how Di Gregorio quietly realises the relationships between Gianni and the four women. These ladies might need a bit of looking after, but they still like to talk about boys, eat good food and even, in one case, wander off in the middle of the night for a furtive drink.<br /><br />Underlying this amiable, thoughtful film is an assumption that age should bring with it respect  and however exasperated he gets, Gianni abides by this code completely. Oddly, the film reminded me a little of Curb Your Enthusiasm, partly because Gianni, with his silly domestic horse-trading, comes across as a much kinder incarnation of Larry David and partly because it shares a freewheeling concern for the absurdity of the everyday, such as when Gianni has to buy food from a local fisherman to feed his unexpected guests. But this is very much a real and warm enterprise, not least because Di Gregorio extracts such lovely performances from his elderly cast. A treat.</p><p>Click here to read our interview with the director of 'Mid-August Lunch' <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Click here to read an interview with Cruz<br />Theres often something charmingly eccentric about the English titles of Pedro Almodvars films, as if Spains greatest living director spent just a few minutes pondering their translation with the aid of an online Spanish-English dictionary. Live Flesh? What exactly is that? Bad Education? The Spanish means Bad Manners or Ill Bred. And now Broken Embraces. Im not sure what they are either, although having seen Almodvars seventeenth film twice, whats clear is that the name reflects the feeling of watching it: it pulls you in and repels you, pulls you in and repels you. After over two hours of flirtation and rejection (this is Almodvars longest film), it finally resolves itself into a beautiful love letter to cinema and its glorious potential, but not without exploring the darker side of the medium and how a film can so easily slip through its makers fingers.<br /><br />While some of Almodvars films are out-and-out heartbreakers  perfect storms of melodrama, storytelling and extreme living  this is a more cerebral, self-reflective and noir-ish affair. Its part of his brilliance to tell wild stories without you even batting an eyelid. But here you cant help notice the films complexity, not least because this tragic romantic thriller is mostly about films and filmmaking: Almodvar is intent on piling image upon image so that there are several films within a film, including an amusing pastiche of the directors own Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, here renamed Girls and Suitcases.<br />We start in the present: Harry Caine (Llus Homar) is a blind scriptwriter who doesnt let his disability disarm him: we encounter him having fun on his sofa with a woman who helped him to cross the road. But his past rears its head when a young man comes knocking and we flash back to 1992 to meet Lena (Penlope Cruz), a young secretary driven to desperate measures to help her ill father. Two years later, Lena is living with her violent, older millionaire boss Ernesto Martel (Jos Luis Gmez) and starring in a film funded by Martel and directed by Caine  not yet blind and using his real name, Mateo Blanco.<br />To explain more is unnecessary, but Almodvar explores themes of spying and control, each of which he reflects through cinema itself: Martel follows his wife via snatched video recordings; Blanco fights for the ownership of his work as much as he struggles to keep a grip on his life; and Lena seeks personal and professional escape through acting.<br />Cruz is as enchanting as ever and channels images of actresses from Monroe to Audrey Hepburn through her various masks of hair, clothes and make-up. The photography may be more restrained in colour than anything Almodvar has produced but this suits the films stately, reflective air. Be warned though: you have to be prepared to think more than you feel, and to think more about cinema even than life itself. But what brilliant thoughts<br />Click here to read an interview with Cruz<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Click here for an in-depth look at 'District 9'</p><p>Science-fiction and politics used to be inextricably intertwined, with sci-fi shedding light on contemporary issues through the construction of fantastic, allegorical worlds. Blame George Lucas, blame the studio money men, but sci-fi has become a largely escapist genre: dime store romance for white males. Not that theres anything wrong with escapism, as Neill Blomkamp demonstrates in the latter half of his debut feature, District 9. But he sets up his political agenda first, and the result pays dividends both as ideology and entertainment. <br />The place is present-day Johannesburg, a recognisably gritty, crime-filled metropolis on the brink of permanent collapse. But in Blomkamps South Africa theres a new underclass: a race of immigrant aliens known as prawns, survivors of a dying planet searching for a new home. Our guide into this world is Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a self-satisfied middle manager for shady global corporation MNU, whose task is to contain the prawns within their hastily constructed inner city slum, District 9.<br />It would have been easy for Blomkamp to play the film as a straight Apartheid metaphor, a blunt but rather outdated critique of inequality. But District 9 has a more pressing and timely agenda: its about the legacy of that hateful regime, how its insidious influence has produced a country where the previously disenfranchised black citizenry are beginning to turn on an even more  deprived social group: immigrants. And so the film becomes a portrait of cyclical segregation, with the prawns as a catch-all metaphor for displaced asylum seekers worldwide. <br />But District 9 is no dry socio-political treatise. The opening scenes use newsflashes, ad breaks and to-camera interviews to set up the complex backstory, but these distancing techniques fall away as our focus narrows on Wikus, who is beginning to experience grotesque bodily transformations after accidentally ingesting a mysterious alien fluid. The climactic sequences  as MNUs hunt for the renegade Wikus causes widespread and violent disruption  eschew subtext entirely in favour of nailbiting, brain-splattering action, but its unlikely many viewers will begrudge Blomkamps decision to cut loose. <br />With the films finale  and Stateside success  leaving the stage set for a potential District 10,  perhaps were witnessing a new dawn for politically engaged sci-fi and horror, with Blomkamp as a latter-day George Romero. Either way, this is a stunningly impressive debut.<br />Click here for an in-depth look at 'District 9' <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its a frustrating case of individual triumph cancelling out collective cohesion in this sporadically enjoyable, if tonally mismatched, anthology of five short films, each intent on skewering the political corruption that set in during the final 15 years of the Ceaucescu regime in Romania (touted as The Golden Age). The film feeds its tall tales (or legends) through an absurdist comic mangle in order to explore the cruel ironies bubbling beneath the surface of party policy. While the hits far outweigh the misses, its still something of a struggle to ingest a would you believe it? funny such as The Legend of the Party Photographer (which hilariously riffs on the draconian censorship of state newspaper Scinteia) when followed by the more melancholy likes of The Legend of the Chicken Driver (about a bashful trucker who instigates a poultry scam to impress a woman). Impressive, then, but really uneven.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>As consumers become hyperaware of—and more immune to—advertising’s effects, the stealth-marketing industry has developed some truly sinister ways to control how we spend our hard-earned wages. That’s the thesis of cowriter-director Derrick Borte’s depressing satire, which tracks the titular clan that demands to be kept up with after moving into a McMansion community. The setup is brilliant, even if it doesn’t play out so cleverly: The Joneses aren’t an actual family, but a sleeper cell of ambitious marketeers hired by a mysterious corporation—the golf nut “dad” (Duchovny) being the most recent recruit. All of the family members are silver-tongued Type A’s: the fake high-schooler daughter (Heard) imploring her peers to buy the latest cosmetics and diet pills; the son (Ben Hollingsworth) hawking tech gadgets and video games; and Mom (Moore) working her housewife ripple-effect integration at the salon.</p><p>The spot-on cast almost holds the movie together, but whatever potential this timely premise has is wasted on reworking the same gag about overconsumption. Once romance gets in the way of business and one of the conniving Joneses suddenly finds their humanity, it’s only a matter of time before everything implodes. More discomforting is that real Audis and Dell computers show up among the fake luxuries, which means the joke’s really on us: Product placement strikes again! </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A clever satire on Londons art scene? What a treat. But no  what we get with this slick, shallow and flesh-adoring adaptation of Danny Moynihans NYC-set novel, transposed to London, is a limp series of caricatures, hysterical scenes and an overloaded plot that suggest its makers cared more about packing the frame with names than getting the characters and comedy just right. And what names: Danny Huston, Gillian Anderson, Heather Graham, Alan Cumming, Christopher Lee, Amanda Seyfried, Stellan Skarsgrd, Jaime Winstone and Simon McBurney all appear. Its a giggle at times. Huston is louche as a Jay Jopling-like art dealer trying to get his hands on a Mondrian; Anderson amuses as a scene-obsessed collector; and Cumming is shrill as a wannabe curator-manager rejected by a self-obsessed video artist (Winstone) once she finds success. But well-connected, first-time feature director Duncan Ward (his wife is a top curator) throws too much mud too fondly for any to stick. Art world aficionados will have a jolly time identifying the characters and tut-tutting. Others will just tut-tut.]]></review>

Derecq Twist (Oldham) is a quiet radical of the Morris dancing world, although you wouldn't guess it from looking at this meek West Dorset tractor mechanic. Actress Akhurst directs her first feature from a script by lead actor Oldham, whose mock-doc approach to Morris is straight out of the Christopher Guest mould. It's tough to maintain the momentum of this brand of straight-faced comedy over an entire feature, but a kind-hearted approach to character and warm attitude towards its subject helps  along with the sort of daring that allows Akhurst to film Californian scenes in what looks suspiciously like Devon. Akhurst's thesp connections no doubt helped to lure names such as Jacobi, Walter and Wise to the party. Very silly, but rigorously so.]]></review>
