      <review><![CDATA[Fifty years on, you could say that Hitchcocks sleek, wry, paranoid thriller caught the zeitgeist perfectly: Cold War shadiness, secret agents of power, urbane modernism, the ant-like bustle of city life, and a hint of dread behind the sharp suits of affluence. Cary Grants Roger Thornhill, the films sharply dressed ad exec who is sucked into a vortex of mistaken identity, certainly wouldnt be out of place in Mad Men. But theres nothing dated about this perfect storm of talent, from Hitchcock and Grant to writer Ernest Lehman (Sweet Smell of Success), co-stars James Mason and Eva Marie Saint, composer Bernard Herrmann and even designer Saul Bass, whose opening-credits sequence still manages to send a shiver down the spine.<br />Hitchcock breezes through a tongue-in-cheek, nightmarish plot with a lightness of touch thats equalled by a charming performance from Grant (below), who copes effortlessly with the scripts dash between claustrophobia and intrigue on one hand and romance and comedy on the other. The story is a pass-the-parcel of escalating threats, all of them interior fears turned inside-out: doubting mothers, untrustworthy lovers, vague government handlers, corrupt cops. Within minutes of the films opening, shady strangers in a hotel lobby mistake Thornhill for a George Caplin and from there we sprint from country house to the United Nations, from the ticket hall of Grand Central Station to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. Thornhills ignorance of his fate and complete lack of control offer Hitchcock a brilliant blank canvas on which to experiment with a story that would sound ludicrous on paper, yet it feels like anythings possible in Lehmans playful script. Im an advertising man, not a red herring, says Thornhill. He couldnt be more mistaken.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Its quite likely that Staff Sgt. William James (Renner)the
bomb-defusing expert at the center of the terrific Iraq War action film
<i>The Hurt Locker</i>was named by screenwriter Mark Boal after a
certain pragmatic 19th-century philosopher. On the
cleverness-to-profundity scale, that falls somewhere between calling a
desert-island survivalist Locke and christening a living stuffed tiger
Hobbes. But James is more than his moniker, not so much
larger-than-life as eternally engaged, gruntlike, with one thing he
does better than anyone else.<p>Renner, whose half-muscled pudginess calls to mind Fassbinder circa <i>Fox and His Friends</i>,
gets inside Jamess skin in ways that a more seasoned celebrity could
not. Its a role that might have easily have come across as one-note,
especially with a story that toggles between machismo-laden home-base
drama and perilously prolonged fieldwork. Yet in this actors hands,
the character comes off with a credible working-class clarityhes less
concerned with heroics than with doing a good job and pissing the night
away.</p><p>The James-free prologue, which features the first of two
star cameos, sets the stakes high. But Bigelow doesnt mine traditional
suspense so much as impart a queasy feeling of monotony. <i>The Hurt Locker</i>
is all about repetition. Superimposed titles count down the days left
in James and his squads rotation, though theres little sense of
movement toward an ultimate end. As the opening Chris Hedges quote
(war is a drug) suggests, there are no accomplishments in this line
of work, only an unending round of highs, lows and in-betweens.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Kitsch is most enjoyable when it doesnt know its kitsch. Everyone involved in Shutter Island  most obviously director Martin Scorsese and star Leonardo DiCaprio  seem to be taking this berserk, meandering story absolutely seriously, which only serves to make an already fun psychological thriller all the more ludicrous and entertaining.<br />The film is set in 1954. DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a US marshal dispatched to the titular oceanbound asylum to investigate the disappearance of a criminally insane inmate from her locked cell. He soon begins to suspect that this remote facility isnt all it appears  is Ben Kingsleys avuncular psychiatrist really as kindly and welfare-conscious as he seems? Why are the guards so heavily armed? And whats with the mysterious lighthouse that all the patients seem so terrified of? To make matters worse theres a hurricane coming in, the generators are on the blink and Teddys new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) is starting to look decidedly shifty. Taxi Driver this aint.<br />Actually, the Scorsese movie it most resembles is his previous exercise in Hitchcockian overkill, 1991s Cape Fear. With DiCaprio rather limp and forgettable in the lead, Shutter Island lacks the centrifugal might of De Niros powerhouse central performance in the earlier film. But it compensates with pure visual, aural and narrative excess: this is modern gothic taken to its (il)logical extreme, a work of pure operatic delirium. The closest Shutter Island gets to a commanding, De Niro-like presence might be its perverse, overbearing soundtrack, a selection of the most doom-laden pieces by modern composers ranging from Kryzstof Penderecki to Max Richter. Every twist in the tale is accompanied by a frenzied flurry of violins, every moment of violence underscored by a pounding, atonal piano crescendo.<br />While the narrative, adapted from Dennis Lehanes 2003 novel, is hopelessly convoluted, the film is held together by the sheer bludgeoning force of Scorseses directorial vision. Never one to shy away from visual overindulgence, Scorsese has used Shutter Island as an excuse to really throw open his box of tricks, chucking in gaudy but strikingly beautiful dream sequences, harrowing (if rather tasteless) concentration camp flashbacks and the most thunderous, howling rainstorms this side of Suspiria. <br />In fact, Argentos film, a similarly monumental and manic triumph of style over substance, may be the most appropriate comparison here. And while Scorsese may lack the giallo masters manic invention, the tension between his natural tendency towards old-fashioned Hollywood classicism and his evident desire to cut loose gives the film its strange, irrestistible power. As senseless, perverse and unwieldy as it undoubtedly is, Shutter Island might be Scorseses most enjoyable film in a decade.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Blunt is such a fine actress that its strange to see her upstaged
by a Cavalier King Charles spaniel. The dog is the most interesting
character in <i>The Young Victoria</i>, a historical drama so inert
that you begin to wonder why anyone paid for the costumes. The concept
of young biopics is itself flawed: Yes, Victoria ushered in an era of
progress and plenty in Britain, but all of that takes place after the
movie ends. Instead, her compressed youth is played as protofeminist
high romance, a concept already exhausted (and then some) by the Jane
Campion oeuvre.</p><p>All shall sigh as one as Victoria (Blunt) resists
signing her authority over to a regentan unheard-of failure to kowtow
to authority that onscreen is never shown as anything other than a
no-brainer. Later, she forgoes marriage to a bland and unscrupulous
politician (Bettany) in favor of the blander and excruciatingly
scrupulous Prince Albert (Friend), who is shockedshocked!to find that
it sometimes rains in England. Smacking of screenwriters desperation
(at least in context), even a late-breaking assassination attempt fails
to shake the movies stupor. The script is by the talented Julian
Fellowes (<i>Gosford Park</i>), but these films are a matter of style and perspective; change the title to <i>The Young</i> [insert famous person here], and it would make little difference.</p>]]></review>

While the others trade in stop-motion precision and CGI physics, this one goes fully for abstraction. Its a brooding story set firmly in the Dark Ages and Celtic legend. When smoke billows over the walled, titular enclavea home to gentle monks and familiesthe plumes come in looping, circular scribbles and your mind has to make the leap. (It does.)</p><p>In Kells lives young Brendan (McGuire), who, shepherded by his severe abbot father (the tart-tongued Gleeson), intends one day to illuminate a book with his goose-quilled pen. The boy yearns to see the outside world, though, and this is where he goesthe mostly hand-drawn animation morphs into strange new shapes as the trees narrow, crows caw menacingly and a female fairy slinks around in the form of a snowy panther. Its all fairly enchanting, and theres the added euphoria of being free of the incessant pop-culture riffing of either Disney or Altman-loving hipster directors. The movie isnt quite suitable for the extremely young, but its apocalyptic tint may be catnip for smart preteens. Theyll breathe in the chilly air of a mysterious forestthe way forests should be. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Filmmakers love a good prison. No, scrub that, filmmakers adore a bad prison. You can see why. For writers and directors, the volatile jail is a ready-made theatre, its prisoners and guards with their various conflicts and loyalties all perfect players for a drama that, if it tries hard enough, can reflect life on the outside too. <br />For French director Jacques Audiard (A Self-Made Hero, The Beat That My Heart Skipped), a master of the old-school French thriller  ie thrilling and meaningful  his fifth film offers the chance to pull off both a state-of-nation primal scream and a terrific crime flick. He gives us Malik (Tahar Rahim), a French-Arab convict who enters a concrete-and-steel hell to serve a sentence of six years (so we know he cant have done anything too dreadful). He tries to keep his head down, but this isnt that sort of place. The ruling bully boys are the Corsican inmates, led by ageing but vicious Csar (Niels Arestrup), who forces Malik to kill another inmate in a very successful scene thats one of the most claustrophobic and disturbing episodes Ive seen in a long while. From here, Malik is Csars vassal, committed to working for him on the inside and, later, using a series of day-release excursions to represent his criminal interests on the outside.<br /><br />But Malik is a clever individualist  a survivalist even  and at the same time that he learns to read and write, he exploits a friendship with another French-Arab prisoner, now released, to pursue his own drug deals and quietly invest in a power base within the jail. This is a world where partnerships are formed only for a reason, loyalties are fluid, friends barely exist at all. Politically, its a cynical film. Hope is absent.<br />Whether, though, it says anything meaningful about France, Im not so sure. Malik is an extreme character, so his experience doesnt reflect the French-Arab dilemma as a whole, even if the point is made about the number of immigrants in French jails and how being sent to prison for a minor offence can snowball into something else entirely. Audiard suggests that being an underdog  socially, racially, economically  in an unfriendly society can lead to desocialisation and anti-social behaviour. But Maliks story is so wild that it obscures such ideas.<br /><br />That said, its testament to Audiards skill at plunging us headfirst into a vicious parallel world that we mostly believe the films twisted logic and rituals. Also, his presentation of violence as a profit-and-loss account is effective and mature: while Maliks initial murder may get him far, we witness nightly visions of his victim coming back to his cell to haunt him. But there are several bite-your-tongue moments. The film is realist in style and mood, but for every five spot-on observations, there is one flight of wild fancy. Ive seen the film twice and still find baffling an episode in which Malik predicts that a deer will hit a car, thereby suggesting he is a prophet.<br />But the sheer force of Audiards direction can support such enigmas. It forces you, bullies you, persuades you to love his filmmaking style  even if not always to understand his motives.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<i>Reviewed at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival</i><br />Marco Bellocchios career stretches back to the mid-60s and Fists in the Pocket and China Is Near. Subsequent decades have traced an uneven trajectory, highlights including In the Name of the Father (1971), Leap into the Void (1980), My Mothers Smile (2002) and Good Morning, Night (2004). Not that Cannes ever really ignored him: the last 15 years have also seen The Prince of Homburg, The Nanny and The Wedding Director honoured on the Croisette.Few of Bellocchios films can have carried quite the weight of his latest, however. Vincere manages to succeed both as historical melodrama and as a salutary reminder that history tends to repeat itself. <br />Based on a true story and kicking off in the years before the First World War, it centres on Ida Dalser, a woman whom we first encounter helping to protect Benito Mussolini, then a young journalist and union activist, from an angry mob. Some years later she sees him again, demonstrating to another angry audience his proof that God doesnt exist, and an affair begins. Passionately in love, Ida supports her lovers professional ambitions and bears him a child, only to discover that he already has a wife and family. Even that she is prepared to tolerate, but as Benitos Fascists gain power, both her own presence and her sons become unwelcome irritants to his career.<br />The story itself, while fascinating and rooted in fact, is hardly packed with surprises, but what distinguishes Vincere is the flair with which the tale is related. First, one should certainly mention the excellent lead performances of Giovanna Mezzogiorno as Ida and Filippo Timi as Mussolini. But even more impressive is Bellocchios virtuosity in combining drama, archive footage, and music  not merely Carlo Crivellis thundering orchestral score but various existing works both classical and popular  to create a highly cinematic oratorio of enormous rhetorical force: a style, by the way, which is highly appropriate to the bombast favoured by Il Duce.<br />And therein lies the movies real strength. Because if, by the end, you somehow havent already realised that this is a film which is as much about the present (and, one fears, the future) as its about the past, then the final scenes, with Mussolini figlio insanely parroting his fathers ludicrously hysterical oratory, are a chilling reminder of the policies as well as the performing style of Italys current leader.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Guy Ritchie the director and Guy Ritchie the screenwriter part ways for this latest spin on the Sherlock Holmes story, and if separation turns into divorce it would be no bad thing, at least on the evidence of this big-hearted, atmospheric entertainment. Shed of his tedious infatuation with off-the-peg London gangsters, Ritchie proves a competent teller of the fast-paced, not po-faced yarn. Here, Robert Downey Jr draws on his wild-eyed side to play the detective, while Jude Law assumes the more sober clothes of his sidekick, Dr Watson. Plunging into their careers mid-flow, we watch as they confront a conspiracy of national proportions. <br />They discover an aristocrat, Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), in the middle of a ritualistic murder of a young woman. In this early scene, Ritchies Holmes reveals himself as a physical titan in a witty interlude in which we witness in slow motion the microscopic details of his plan to incapacitate an assailant by brute force. The villain hangs, but, for Holmes and Watson, this is just the start of a series of fights, rescues, escapes and revelations, all cloaked in creaky supernatural mumbo jumbo.<br />Ritchies Sherlock Holmes is effective as a caricatured comedy adventure and shows some fidelity to Arthur Conan Doyle, especially in Downey Jrs portrayal of the eccentric but cold-hearted Holmes. The banter between Holmes and Watson isnt as witty as it should be, but the detectives lone mutterings, especially his deductions, are fun. The films biggest success is its evocation of Victorian London, via much location work and CG rendering: here, Ritchies grittily romantic view of our city comes into its own, culminating in a delicious climax on the girders of a half-built Tower Bridge.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Above and beyond its bizarrely styled titlechanged to avoid confusion with the Dakota Fanning action film <i>Push</i>this
Sundance winner is a tough sell even for those who like it. The movie
is at once irritatingly glib and undeniably bold in its portrait of a
late-80s, illiterate Harlem teenager (Sidibe) with no obvious escape
route. Shes pregnant with her second child by her father; her daughter
was born with Down syndrome and is currently being raised by her
abusive mother, Mary (MoNique), who blames Precious for stealing her
husband. Mary also sees Precious as a financial burden andto humiliate
her for her obesityforces her to overeat.</p><p>Producer-turned-director Daniels (his only other feature is the reputedly nutso <i>Shadowboxer</i>)
has a tendency to fetishize misery, shooting domestic brawls and child
endangerment in a way that seems too arty for comfort. (The sequences
representing Preciouss fantasies are particularly cringeworthy.) On
the other hand, its rare to see such a convincing or poetic portrayal
of life on the margins. Eventually, <i>Precious</i> emerges as an
unsentimental pro-education film: Preciouss only way out is to attend
a special-ed school, where shes assisted by a patient teacher (Patton)
andoutside the classroomby a social worker (a surprisingly good
Carey, whod be unrecognizable if you didnt know she was in the film).
The movie strains to withhold judgment; even Mary gets a redemptive
monologue. The bottom line is that youve never seen anything quite
like thisin its highs, its lows, its gaffes, its embarrassments or its
uplift.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Although far better than its troubled history lead one to fear, this gory, gothic take on the classic lycanthropic love story has had its romantic heart ripped out. Returning to his estranged fathers crumbling pile in 1891  to investigate his brothers disappearance  actor Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) falls for his dead siblings mourning fiance, Gwen (Emily Blunt). But before this spark of love can ignite, Lawrence is bitten by the lunar-tic creature the locals fear, and must confront the beast buried within himself. With its mist-shrouded sets, gruesome slaughter and copious CGI, this is a surprisingly respectful updating of the 1941 Universal original. Thanks to Rick Bakers make-up effects, Del Toros transformations from handsome lover to hairy, howling beast are frighteningly convincing; Anthony Hopkins is restrained as his emotionally detached father; and a cruelly underused Blunt is all-a-quiver as the beautiful, bereaved Gwen. Ultimately, though, neither Joe Johnstons efficient direction nor Danny Elfmans hard-working score can lift the familiar storyline out of the ordinary. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Best wipe 8 1/2 from your mind, or at least delay seeing Fellinis loopy masterpiece, if youre going to enjoy this angsty romp through the directors 1963 film about a fictional Italian filmmaker, Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis), who loses his mojo and might be about to lose his marbles and his marriage.<br />Surprisingly, though, theres lots in this musical version, itself an adaptation of a 1980s Broadway show, that relates to the sombre heart of Fellinis original. We still get Guidos formative childhood memory of watching a prostitute perform on the beach (although this time it is Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas brilliantly belting out the films foot-tapping anthem Be Italian). We also get the lingering ghost of his mother (Sophia Loren!), the pain of his adultery and the madness of his creative impasse. Also, Fellinis meshing of dream and reality is oddly suited to the unreal tendencies of a musical, although its anybodys guess what the director would have made of Penlope Cruz throwing herself around in stockings and suspenders and upping the sex factor beyond anything Claudia Cardinale offered in the original.<br />The biggest difference, though, is that almost 50 years later, director Rob Marshall (Chicago) is able to play the story of 8 1/2 as a nostalgia piece. He fetishises the look and feel of 1960s Italy and especially Rome so that the films mood of artistic melancholia is expressed on a canvas that comes dangerously close to looking like an ad for Italian coffee. Marshall and his writers, including the late Anthony Minghella, also stress the humour of Guidos philandering, often preferring that his inner turmoil goes no further than chain-smoking. To give Day-Lewis his due, the actor grounds the films sillier tendencies in a charming performance of mercurial despair. Hes well supported by Marion Cotillard, who conveys the sadness of being Guidos wife, although both Nicole Kidman as his leading lady and Kate Hudson as an admiring journalist are little more than window-dressing.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Attempts to claim <i>Bad Lieutenant</i> as prime Herzog are
probably futile, as its difficult to tell whether the movie intends to
be taken seriously or whether its a mad experiment featuring Cage as
its chief variable. Either way, is there anything not to like? Bearing
no resemblance to Abel Ferraras 1992 masterpiece apart from a central
character type, <i>Bad Lieutenant: POCNO</i> essentially takes the
script for a mediocre cop drama and retrofits it with Cages most
batshit performance yet. Scowling, hunched over from back pain, given
to Tourettic pronouncements (sometimes delivered in a Cagney accent)
and alarmingly nonchalant about his drug habit (Whatever I take is
prescription, except for the heroin), Cage plays the character as a
Klaus Kinski figure. Hes spent most of the decade pushing the bounds
of what it means to go over the top, and this time his directoralways
interested in forces of natureis eager to see how far hell reach.
There are also other Herzog touches, including an interlude shot from
an iguanas point of view and and a fantastically abrupt denouement.</p><p>If
we can take this driest of humorists seriously, the movies New
Orleansset crime story begs to be read as a commentary on privilege: A
white cop flouts the laws hes charged with enforcing, and society
rewards him for it. (He also belongs to Herzogs gallery of quixotic
dreamers, innocently recalling a childhood treasure hunt to
prostitute-girlfriend Mendes.) Still, who cares? The movie includes
Cage raving about his lucky crack pipe and cutting off an old ladys
oxygen supply. If you enjoyed Cages histrionics in <i>The Wicker Man</i>, <i>Bad Lieutenant</i> is for you.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Everything you may have heard about Mulligans breakout performance
in this film is true; with baffling ease, she steals a movie from such
noted movie-stealers as Molina, Sarsgaard and Thompson. As Jenny, a
too-clever girl in early 1960s London who gets involved with an older
man, Mulligan delivers little surprises in almost every scene. It can
be a line reading or the way she carries herself or an exquisitely held
pause. No one around her is bad; its just that shes so good.</p><p>Jenny
seems to be conducting her life with a slight ironic detachment, so
that when she says shes planned out the loss of her virginity for her
17th birthday, it seems like a little joke shes sharing with life. For
a while, its fun watching her break free of the carefully plotted life
her father (Molina) has in mind for her in the most scandalous way she
can, by dating 30-ish operator David (Sarsgaard). And Jennys
justification for her rebellion against conformity, delivered in an
amazing speech to school headmistress Thompson, is so compelling that
its a bit of a shock when the script turns moralistic and conservative
in the second half. It says a lot for Mulligan and Sarsgaard that for
nearly half the movie they make the idea of a 30-ish man dating a girl
of 17 seem daring but not icky. In this day and age, thats a hell of
an accomplishment, and its largely Mulligans doing.</p>]]></review>

      <genre><![CDATA[Drama]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[We tend to make a fuss of debutants. We celebrate their precocity. We excuse their naivety. But sometimes the word is misleading. Take Tom Ford. A Single Man is the 48 year olds first film, but can we really call a man who spent ten years as the creative director of Gucci a beginner? Couture is not cinema, but there are similarities. Both have a tendency to crush art with commerce. Both demand that an army of creatives  art directors, production designers, photographers and the rest  unite behind a vision that is sold ruthlessly to the public. So its worth remembering that Fords toolbag was already full to brimming when he embarked on his first film  though whether or not he knew how to use those tools is another thing entirely.<br />Christopher Isherwoods short 1964 novel A Single Man is a superb choice for a concise, intimate film. Its events are few, its emotional power is cumulative. The book visits one day in the life of George, a gay British expat and middle-aged literature teacher in 1962 Los Angeles. We learn gradually that George lost his younger partner, Jim, in a car crash and discover much later that this is a significant day for George, a slow reveal that gives the text a random, quotidian quality.<br />Ford turns the book on its head so that we know both these things from the start. But other than that, the books interior nature and sense of wandering remain in Fords delicate, moving film. We follow George (Colin Firth) closely, often alone, from morning to night. We watch as he gives a lesson on Aldous Huxley and join him on a drunken evening at the home of his soulmate and compatriot, Charlotte (Julianne Moore). Later, were with him during a late-night flirtation with a pupil, Kenny (Nicholas Hoult). And, in flashback, we see snapshots of his earlier, happier life with Jim (Matthew Goode).<br />As a director, Ford manages to exude both extreme confidence and first-time nerves. Only a beginner would decide that the best way to add structure to a near-perfect story is to insert a gun from almost the very first scene. But the control and precision with which Ford tells his story helps us to ignore this choice and still trust his vision, which falls off the screen with an intoxicating fluidity, helped by evocative editing of sound and image and an increasingly affecting score by Abel Korzeniowski. The film looks gorgeous. Young Spanish DoP Eduard Gran, a graduate of the National Film and Television School, shoots on an old 35mm stock that gives the images a soft precision. Almost all the film is colour, but the colours tell a story themselves: Ford manipulates the films brightness so that it glows and darkens depending on Georges mood. Rather than coming across as a gimmick, this serves the emotional ebb and flow of the book well and helps to turn the literary into the cinematic.<br />Maybe the film is too pristine. In this world, dust doesnt land, paint doesnt peel and grass doesnt grow. Georges black-and-white suit-and-tie combo is too perfect and his house is a modernist dream. His partner was an architect, were told. His director is a fashion designer, were thinking.<br />But nothing distracts from the empathy and understanding we have for George, and on that the film must live or die. Firths portrayal of a man repressing his grief while being unable to repress his instinct for love and for life is excellent and moving, while Fords balancing of depth and surface is precarious but ultimately winning. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Like its predecessor 'Flanders', this is watchable enough and an improvement on the wretched 'LHumanit', but it still feels bogus in its Bressonian aspirations and mechanical in its religiosity and mysterious narrative drift. About (but is it really?) a young nun returned to the world to curb her more extreme inclinations, whose chance encounter with two Arab brothers from the Parisian projects has literally earth-shaking consequences, the film is often utterly implausible except on the most superficial levels. Sokolowski is occasionally effective as the lead, but shes not subtle enough to make the film make proper sense; an inevitable redemptive ending is pure, plagiaristic tosh. <br />]]></review>

craftsmanshipthe work of a perfectionist whose attention to detail
extends to the trinkets and the matchbooks. None of that has changed: <i>Avatar</i>s
action is refreshingly clear, and the ballyhooed Navi world is a
masterwork of eye-popping design and sweeping camera moves, with a
degree of texture and dimensionality one wouldnt have presumed
possible.</p><p>As a demo reel, <i>Avatar</i> is phenomenal. But
while Cameron has fussed over the glow of every tentacle and wing tip,
the big-picture elements have gotten lost. The story, involving a
phlegmatic Marine (Worthington) who intervenes in colonizing forces
attempts to mine unobtainium on the distant moon Pandora, quickly
devolves into a rehash of <i>Dances with Wolves</i>. Making <i>Titanic</i>s
corny but absorbing romance look Pulitzer-worthy, the script consists
almost exclusively of dire boilerplate, while the cast members seem to
be vying with each other in an ongoing blandness contest.</p><p>The
human footagewhich resembles nothing so much as the full-motion video
games of the early 90sis distracting for its relative drabness.
(Theres a sense of actors constrained by having to hit their marks, to
make way for special effects.) And the various levels of allegoryin
which the peace-loving, preservationist Navi are eventually equated
with Iraqi insurgentscompete to the point of incoherence. Cameron once
again proves hes a visionary, but the mythmaker who gave us <i>The Terminator</i> remains MIA.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Back in the 1990s, Disney ruled the animated roost with a curious
fusion of old-fashioned storytelling and Broadway-esque tunes. With <i>The Princess and the Frog</i>, Disney goes back to the old formula, this time with Randy Newman composing the songs. <i>Princess</i>
is pleasantly nostalgic, with a few gentle winks at Disney past (little
girls obsessed with being princesses) and some catchy tunes. You wont
have the Pixar wow feeling; instead, youll get something comfortably
familiar. </p><p>Tiana (Anika Noni Rose), whom Disney has been trumpeting as its
first African-American heroine, dreams of opening her own restaurant,
but along the way she gets tangled up with a visiting prince (Bruno Campos)
who has been turned into a frog by a voodoo priest. When Tiana also
gets turned into a frog, they set out to find an old woman who can
reverse the spell. Though the animators take the soft-focus-background
style too far, the film generally looks great in the way that
hand-animated films do. The writers tiptoe carefully through the
minefield of racial representation (Cajuns may have more to object to
here than African-Americans), and the story has just enough twists to
keep it fresh.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Football fans know that the blind side is the quarterbacks
vulnerable spot when hes scouring the field for a pass. Moviegoers
attuned to the metaphorical nature of film titles can guess, however,
that the phrase applies to more than just grid-irony in John Lee Hancocks
based-on-a-true-story parable. Societys blind side, you see, is where
impoverished, hulking African-American athlete Big Mike Oher (Quinton Aaron)
lived until plucky Southern mother Leigh Anne Touhy (Sandra Bullock) took him
in. (Tough-talking mamas from Tennessee: What cant they fix?) As for
the saving glories of the game, youve first got to suffer through an
hour of Big Mikes bleached-blond guardian angel dropping saintly
Hallmark platitudes. Youve changed his life, one character tells
Leigh Anne. No, she says, complete with elongated dramatic pause.
Hes changed mine. Garrggh! Just bring on the sports-movie clichs
already.</p><p>Its tempting to think this vanilla take on a stock
inspirational tale exists solely to make an expressionistic emotional
steamroller like <i>Precious</i> seem even more graceful than it is.
Or, more importantly, that the movie regards this at-risk youth as
nothing other than a vehicle for making suburban moms in the audience
feel better about themselves on the postscreening drive to Costco. Is
this some sort of white-guilt thing? a ready-made villain asks
rhetorically. Actually, no; its just blinkered middle-class pandering
at its most shameless.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Given that Alvin and chums originally started out in 1958 as a trio of high-pitched recording artists, its only right that this live-action squeakquel should begin with the furry little CG blighters wooing a concert crowd with a raucous Kinks cover. Unfortunately, its the films only highlight  if the sight of three annoying furballs murdering You Really Got Me can be considered a highlight.<br />Id like to think the filmmakers had a lengthy deliberation about a storyline, but I suspect they simply caught an episode of The X Factor and the recently released Bandslam and thought a premise involving a self-centred Alvin, a rival group of female chipmunks (The Chipettes) and a college talent contest would prove a mighty good wheeze. And, indeed, that might have been the case had the story any semblance of a story. Instead, what were offered is a succession of lifeless scenes punctuated by pratfalls that only a handful of kids in the audience found funny. Next.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Russia, 1910. In his old age, Leo Tolstoy has become so famous worldwide that the merest hint hes about to pop his clogs sends newsreel cameras gathering in anticipation. The real story though, as this slightly fusty drama elaborates, is unfolding inside the Tolstoy household, where the octogenerian writer (Christopher Plummer, authentically beardy) finds himself in the centre of a dispute over the valuable publishing rights to War and Peace. The Tolstoyan political movement  an organisation espousing his ideas on communal property to combat social injustice  sense a major funding opportunity should Tolstoy sign his best-known book over to their leader Chertkov (Paul Giamatti), yet Tolstoys aristocratic wife Sofya (Helen Mirren), having delivered him 13 children, is determined to fight her corner to the bitter end.<br />Idealism versus family ties makes for a potentially juicy set-to, yet its the historical detail which keeps this adaptation of Jay Parinis novel relatively intriguing, rather than merely stodgy. Writer-director Michael Hoffman is all reverence towards Tolstoy himself, but curiously supercilious towards the beliefs of the Tolstoyan movement, thus undermining the key subplot (eager young acolyte James McAvoy gets his dream job as the great mans secretary, but must also spy on him) and unfairly loading the central conflict in favour of ferocious spouse Mirren. Her impressively projected performance becomes the dominating factor, causing Plummer to overdo it, and sidelining both the earnestly wet McAvoy and moustache-twirling Giamatti. Engaging performers all, but the movies superficial flummery is slightly exasperating when the true-life events would have provided an even richer palette of ideas.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Movies about country musicians tend to go one of two ways. First, there are those inspired by true events, films like Coal Miners Daughteror Walk the Line, which explore the rise of a legend: all one-room shacks, abusive parents and acres of gingham. Then there are stories inspired by the songs themselves: tales of hardship and loss, redemption and self-discovery, saloon bars, acoustic guitars and gallons of sippin whisky.<br />Crazy Heart falls squarely into the latter bunch. Jeff Bridges plays Bad Blake, a one-time Nashville big hitter reduced to touring Midwestern dives picking up loose change and loose women, his livelihood in even worse shape than his liver. That is, until two events conspire to turn his sinking ship around: a relationship with Maggie Gyllenhaals Jean promises the kind of unflinching affection and familial grounding Blake badly needs, and a gig writing songs for one-time protg-turned-megastar Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) provides a much-needed jolt for his career.<br />In purely story terms this is by-the-numbers stuff, ticking all the expected boxes about redemption and renewal. But writer-director Scott Coopers trick is to turn that predictability into a strength: like a song youve heard a thousand times but which never fails to tug the heartstrings, Crazy Heart feels familiar, even comforting, offering few surprises but a wealth of lovingly crafted, immaculately judged, wholly authentic emotion.<br />The emotion is there in the soundtrack put together by Cooper and producing legend T-Bone Burnett, with new songs by Burnett and Ryan Bingham sitting perfectly alongside obvious inspirations like Townes van Zandt and Waylon Jennings. Its also in Coopers solid direction: despite his inexperience, he never falls prey to flashy first-time director syndrome, confident that his screenplay and cast will carry him through.<br />And its in those remarkable central performances: Bridges has already earned an Oscar nomination, but its impossible to overstate how much his honest, unabashed performance  part The Dude, part Kris Kristofferson  grounds the film. Hes backed by a sympathetic Gyllenhaal, making magic from a potentially thankless role, and a convincing turn from Farrell as the preening bigshot in cowboy clothes. But best of all is Robert Duvall, who essentially defined the subgenre with Tender Mercies back in 1983, and whose quiet, deeply felt turn as a bar owner reminds us of his undimmed but underused talent.<br />A shame, then, that the movie falls at the final hurdle with a series of crude, convenient feelgood twists, leading to an abrupt, unconvincing finale. If Cooper and his cast hadnt done their work so well, hadnt made us care so deeply for these fractured souls, maybe it wouldnt matter. As it is, Crazy Heart is only two-thirds a great movie: but like the song says, that aint bad.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Imagine a skit from <i>Robot Chicken</i> spun out to 75 minutes and youve got a pretty good idea what youre in for with <i>A Town Called Panic</i>.
Using little plastic toy figurines, clay and a lot of handmade props,
Aubier and Patar go on a manic free-associative jaunt about a horse, a
cowboy and an Indian who live together (Dont go into some weird sex
panic: The horse is a sort of mature father figure, and the cowboy and
Indian are like a pair of eight-year-olds). The celebration of the
horses birthday triggers a wild set of adventures involving mysterious
aquatic brick thieves, a giant mechanical penguin, a flirtatious lady
horse and assorted explosions and chases.</p><p>Theres something
rather admirable about directors Stphane Aubier and Vincent Patars ability to tap into the
hyperactive creative mentality of an eight-year-old (complete with
annoying character voices the makers of <i>South Park</i> would kill for). Unfortunately, though <i>A Town Called Panic</i>
is meticulously detailed, its frantic and occasionally grating, like
listening to that eight-year-old spin a story out for more than an
hour. Kudos for the purity of the filmmakers vision, but we cant say
we enjoyed watching it.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[We may have moved from veiled Cold War to explicit global terror in the 25 years since the excellent, UK-set nuclear conspiracy thriller Edge of Darkness first aired on the BBC, directed by Martin Campbell (Casino Royale) and written by Troy Kennedy Martin. Its also been some eight, traumatic post-9/11 years since Mel Gibsons last thespian outing in M Night Shyamalans Signs. But time seems to have stood still in Campbells drab remake for the big screen. With its nuclear concerns and old-fashioned heroics, it feels like a period piece.<br />In condensing the original mini-series into a conventional, two-hour package, scriptwriters William Monahan and Andrew Bovell have sadly sacrificed some of the originals cultural specificity and its slow-burn quality. Moreover, in relocating from northern England to the USs Eastern Seaboard, they have jettisoned much of the chilling atmospherics. Craven, the widowed police officer whose engineer daughter (Bojana Novakovic) is gunned down on a home visit, is now one of Boston PDs finest; and if its true that Gibson, in the role, recalls the earnest intensity and investigative zeal of Bob Pecks original performance, he also brings a lot of unwanted Lethal Weapon-era manic mannerisms to the part.<br /><br />Its basically a little guy against the system movie, literally so in many of Campbells framings  for instance, where he miniaturises Gibsons now slightly wizened figure against the looming bulk of Danny Hustons smarmy corporate bad guy. However, Ray Winstone, as a boozy high-level fixer in pointed contrast to Cravens ginger-ale-drinking sobriety, does offer good value in what is otherwise a surprisingly low-wattage and anonymously directed thriller. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Tim Burtons part-live action, part-animated, all-3D version of Alice in Wonderland is a collage of characters and episodes from Lewis Carrolls two nineteenth-century books about a girl who falls into the rabbit hole of her own imagination. But purists beware: Burton and his writer, Disney regular Linda Woolverton (The Lion King), invent a quest narrative  Alice must slay the Jabberwocky!  that climaxes in a pedestrian battle for which Alice puts aside dresses and channels Joan of Arc. Moreover, our heroines loopy headtrip begins with her fleeing a very public marriage proposal with the twenty-first-century excuse, I need a moment<br />This is a loose, enjoyable and safe spin on the books, with familiar characters doing familiar things within the altered  and digitised  framework of an older Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returning underground to find the Red Queen (a fun Helena Bonham Carter, actually playing a conflation of the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts) ruling a depressed land. <br />The problem with this downtrodden version of Wonderland is that it doesnt always sit well with the mania of Carrolls creations, and when we see a brighter flashback of the Red Queen painting roses, we wish we were in that world. Imagine the Cheshire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), the wise Caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman) and the Mad Hatter (an underwhelming, repetitive Johnny Depp) all doing their thing in the forests of Avatars Pandora after a long bout of acid rain and you begin to get the picture. Much of the colour has been sucked out and replaced with dark skies and long faces.<br />Yet much of Carrolls magical nonsense remains, even if Burtons film wobbles at the gates of anarchy and ends up being a more average affair than many might expect. Its also one in which the inventive costumes and individual flights of animated fancy end up being more memorable than the thin characters and half-hearted 3D rendering. As its Burton at the helm, you could call it gothic. The less generous might just call it gloomy.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Anyone heading to the cinema this February 14 will find themselves conspicuously catered for by this romantic comedy from veteran Garry Marshall (Pretty Woman, Beaches). Throwing out a net to everyone from back-row teenage saliva-swappers to seasoned seniors, the film feels like it has been coldly calculated to hoover up demographics. How? Marshall gives his rom-com the Robert Altman Short Cuts treatment: an enormous megawatt ensemble cast appear in a dozen or so interlocking lurve stories that play out on Valentines Day in Los Angeles. Its supremely efficient and utterly ruthless.<br />There are 19 all-star names above the title (in alphabetical order, naturally) but the lead belongs to Ashton Kutcher. A nice-guy florist, he proposes to his work-addict girlfriend (Jessica Alba), but is obviously much better suited to his teacher best friend (Jennifer Garner). Jessica Biel (is it me, or are the Jessicas interchangeable?) plays a neurotically single sports publicist. Anne Hathaway, an office temp who moonlights as a phone sex operator (little nod to Short Cuts there), hasnt told her new boyfriend about the sideline. Shirley MacLaine, happily married for 50 years, is keeping an old secret from her husband. In what reeks of final-draft add-on, country star Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner from The Twilight Saga pair up as school sweethearts: no actual storyline here, but they tick the pre-teen box big time.<br /><br />These are sassily-scripted but glossy, vacuous fantasies  with the exception of Julia Robertss army captain, whos on short leave from Iraq and meets a guy (Bradley Cooper) on a plane: after some sparky but non-committal flight banter they go their separate ways and both their tales resolve with unexpectedly lovely flourishes. Their stories make the rest of the film look like its got a cold, shiny cash register right where its heart should be.<br />]]></review>

Another achingly earnest adaptation from one of the chick-lit superstars formulaic weepies (<i>The Notebook, A Walk to Remember), Chocolat </i>director Lasse Hallstrms tastefully old-fashioned melodrama has exactly one objective: yanking gallons of cathartic tears out of your face by any means necessary.</p><p>After several heart-swelling weeks togetherwith a turgidly shot make-out session in the rain forever binding our young lovebirdsthe two vow to reunite after the soldiers tour of duty ends, leaving the art of letter writing to stoke their flames of passion. As they barely know each other (meaning ditto for us), however, insincere proclamations about their skin-deep chemistry, as read in voiceover, probably arent enough to lube the eyes. Which doesnt mean <i>Dear John</i> is without a few wet-duct tricks up its sleeve: Theres more autism, cancer, 9/11 shocks and bittersweet heartbreak here than you can shake a hankie at. Sometimes the leads pull off genuine tenderness, and other times their gauzily written caricatures cant elevate such overwrought housewife bait, but chances are, given its literary pedigree, most viewers are preordained to love or loathe it.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The original title of the Stieg Larsson novel which became, in translation, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was Men Who Hate Women: a blunt but fitting description of this angry, intelligent but curiously uninvolving Swedish shaggy dog story. The film sees down-at-heel, crusading journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) hired by industrialist Henrik Vanger to look into the disappearance of his beloved niece more than 30 years before. Blomkvists quest is intercut with the story of Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), a bisexual ex-con cyberpunk computer hacker (only in Sweden!) at the mercy of a corrupt, sexually deviant parole officer.<br />Throughout this beautifully photographed, skilfully constructed film theres a sense were skimming lightly over Larssons characters and themes. Blomkvist is the putative hero, but his investigative journey is a little too familiar, his character too clean-cut to be compelling. Its Salander who holds the attention: superbly played by Rapace, shes a grim, spectral presence in the opening scenes, before shes pushed too far and explodes in a moment of shocking, vengeful violence.<br /><br />Such scenes place The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo above the extended TV mystery it easily could have become, but explicit violence only takes you so far. At heart this is a traditional thriller, down to a series of convenient and underwhelming last-act revelations. For fans of Larssons books this could be the highlight of the cinemagoing year  for the rest of us its a solid, enjoyable but emotionally unengaging detective story.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Were so used to amped-up white-knucklers that the controlled approach of a filmmaker like Roman Polanski is immediately seductive. The director responsible for such mainstays as <i>Chinatown</i> and <i>Rosemarys Baby</i> (and of course his own real-life news cycle) turns Robert Harriss political potboiler involving a ghostwriter (McGregor), a former British prime minister (Brosnan) and an isolated island home into a slow-burn near-masterpiece. Shot in claustrophobic widescreen, the film showcases Polanskis mastery of even expository scenes: A revealing conversation between McGregors so-called ghost and a shady figure played by Tom Wilkinson is so fraught with tension that you expect those malevolent Cocteau-esque hands from<i> Repulsion</i> to burst out of the wall and drag someone into oblivion. <br />The film stays more grounded than that, though it certainly doesnt lack for perverse Polanski flourishes. Theres a great bit of carnal business with the prime ministers wife (Williams) thats filmed in a deadpan long shot. Eli Wallach pops upfrail-looking though spiritedas an old-timer who stokes the writers paranoia about his employers plans for him. And more than one character has a wry aside on the protagonists heritage (Oh, you Brits!), as if it was both a badge of honor and a reason for condescending suspicion. <br />There are all number of similarly colorful touches (the sick-joke ending alone is worth the price of admission) that help to deepen what one colleague suggested is the greatest airport novel ever filmed. Its true that <i>The Ghost Writer</i> doesnt possess the lingering profundity of the directors best workthe War on Terror window dressing is just that. Yet Polanski has made a genre piece with a verve and vitality thats in sadly short supply. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Thirty-five years after Network and All the Presidents Men, in which journalists told uncomfortable truths and defended democracy, Green Zone makes military personnel do the noble work which craven reporters shirk. The only consolation is that the movie is inspired by a work of journalism, Rajiv Chandrasekarans Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraqs Green Zone.<br /><br />Set in Iraq in the months following the 2003 invasion, the film reunites the director and star of The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon; this time, however, we already know the details of the underhanded government action our hero confronts. Damon plays an army warrant officer whose WMD sorties keep coming up empty; unwilling to roll over, hes soon embroiled in a turf war between the CIA and the Pentagon (personified by conscientious Brendan Gleeson and oleaginous Greg Kinnear) while attempting to wrangle a Baathist general (Igal Naor), a useful veteran (Said Faraj) and a useless embedded reporter (Amy Ryan) against a backdrop of more-or-less real events.<br />Greengrasss approach to real-life disaster is far more simplified and pumped up here than it was in United 93 or Bloody Sunday, but theres much to be said for his Bourne in Baghdad approach. The action is robust, the politics simplified but strident, insisting that a wilfully under-prepped war worked against both US and Iraqi interests. By shifting focus from the naively doctrinaire civilians of Chandrasekarans book to street-level soldiers questioning authority, Greengrass concocts a formula with a fighting chance of dispelling the Curse of the Hollywood Iraq Movie. If a picture as conventionally accessible as Green Zone tanks, that campaign is surely lost.]]></review>

Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan are partners in law out to recover a stolen baseball card from some badass Hispanic gangsters. How we arrive at that golden nugget of a plot complication is something for the Robert McKees of the world to illuminate; for the rest of us, this is some soul-sapping dada with which director Kevin Smith is staining his already-dubious rsum.</p><p>The actors constantly indulge in unfocused improv: Morgan is given what feels like a full reel to unleash an unfunny succession of re-created film scenes, each followed by a reaction shot of Willis telling us what said scene is supposed to be (<i>Heat!; The Color Purple!</i>). The camera later fleetingly catches game supporting actor Kevin Pollak doing a spot-on De Niro impersonation, and its like seeing the difference between mastery and cacophony. Nearly all the jokes are spewed as if they were a barrage of bullets. Thats fitting, since this purported comedy is also senselessly violent: Guns are fired with reckless abandon. Blood is carelessly spilled. And amid all the carnage, were supposed to give a damn about whether Morgans wife is cheating on him and if Willis can give his daughter a dream wedding on a cops salary. Then theres the Seann William Scott stoner scenes, but, really, why prolong the torment? <br /></p>]]></review>

Suddenly, the slighted sibling discovers that hes the biological grandchild of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth. Welcome to an outrageous plot twist worthy of a Pedro Almodvar melodrama, but to paraphrase the title of an aborted Welles film: Its all true.</p><p><i>Prodigal Sons</i> is also a first-person testimonial, as documentarian Kimberly Reed films every uncomfortable moment with her brother Marc McKerrow, who wont relinquish their fraternal rivalry even though shes no longer a man. Welless longtime partner Oja Kodar invites them to an idyllic reunion in Croatia, which gives McKerrow a chance to recast his troubled existence and embrace his newfound ancestral fame. Instead, he immediately shames Reed by showing photos of her male past, offering a fascinating glimpse into how self-defining narratives inevitably ensure familial conflict.But instead of pushing deeper into any psychological dilemmas, this dirty-laundry doc gets lost in a sensationalistic flurry driven by a serious emotional unraveling. One particularly violent scene depicts McKerrows instability to an extent that robs him of any dignity, with Reeds narration crowding out his voice. Even when cinematically attempting to heal old wounds, the filmmaker cant help but have the last word.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[George Romeros original The Crazies was a prime slice of raw mid-70s exploitation schlock: scruffy, violent and politically edgy. Breck Eisners remake is slicker, prettier and dumber, but not entirely without merit. The cast is very strong: Timothy Olyphant exudes old-fashioned tough-guy charm as the small town sheriff whose constituents begin falling prey to a disease which turns them into bloodthirsty zombies, while Radha Mitchell provides credible if thankless support as his wife. Theres also an impressively high-strung turn from Joe Anderson (Peter Hook in Control) as a redneck cop on the brink.<br />But the film feels choppy and roughly edited, as though its makers were so keen to keep it short that they hacked out any scares, atmosphere or sense of impending dread. Theres too much story and key details are absent or underexplained. Though far from unwatchable, The Crazies feels like a missed opportunity.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>A far cry from the gritty 70s policiers it conjures with cock-of-the-walk swagger (<i>Serpico, Prince of the City</i>), Antoine Fuquas second-rate retread of his own <i>Training Day</i> is a bloated, multithread drama concerning three burnt-out cops at the end of their seemingly unconnected ropes. Just a week away from receiving his pension, spiritually ruined man-in-blue Eddie (Gere) would rather let crime run rampant than do paperwork; he wakes up each morning to a glass of whiskey and a cocked gun in his mouth. Then theres Officer Tango (Cheadle), whose undercover duty has been so overextended that his loyalties and moral compass have shifted to protect his gangland pal Caz (Snipes). Yes, weve seen that type of hot mess before. And gee, will underpaid narcotics cop Sal (Hawke) ditch his few remaining scruples to make the down payment on a new house for his baby mama, pregnant with twins?</p><p>Across the board, the capable cast of <i>Brooklyns Finest</i> works hard to sell a soulful intensity, which isnt easy considering that each of the leads could proclaim theyre getting too old for this shit at any given moment. Unsubtly scripted by former NYC transit worker Michael C. Martin, the film plays like the inverse of <i>Crash</i>a faux-intricate exercise in crosscutting fatalism that points fingers at its characters rather than the audience. Rock bottom is never as close as it appears and what goes around comes around (and all that noise), but for a character-driven piece digging up old tropes about the strains of humanity buried within corrupted people, the constant threat of violence seems to be its only dramatic momentum.</p>]]></review>

Butler plays Milo Boyd, an ex-cop turned bail bondsman assigned to haul in his ex-wife Nicole (Jennifer Aniston), a hotshot reporter in deep with the law. The pursuit takes this pair of bickering exes from New York to Atlantic City and back, via a series of perfunctory car chases, poorly choreographed punch-ups and excruciating romantic entanglements.<br />The trouble is not so much that Butler isnt funny  he isnt, even slightly  but that he sucks the merest hint of humour from the entire enterprise. Even proven performers like Aniston and Christine Baranski as a sexually voracious mother-in-law are reduced to desperate mugging and hysterical arm-waving in an attempt to fill the comic vacuum which their muscular co-star leaves in his wake. To be fair, the script gives them little to work with: there are maybe three decent laughs, interspersed with long stretches of interminable, would-be witty banter and one near-unwatchable comedy torture scene. <br />The score, too, is atrocious: infuriatingly cheeky in the comedy scenes, switching to screeching Bon Jovi-esque AOR whenever things kick off. The Bounty Hunter isnt bad enough to be offensive: its simply lazy, trite, smug, irritating and a colossal waste of time, talent and money. Therell be worse films released in 2010  but not many.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Jay Baruchel is the gentlest of the Apatow geeklings, more a mascot to sweathogs like Seth Rogen than an equal. (His spindly boxer in <i>Million Dollar Baby</i> looked beatable by even Hilary Swank.) So it makes sense that Baruchels first star vehicle, a twitchy, frequently funny affair, emphasizes the scrawn factor: <i>Shes Out of My League</i> casts him as a polite Pittsburgh airport-security worker, Kirk, dwarfed by the epaulets on his uniform and the pushy advice of his man-gang. When a bombshell traveler, Molly (Eve), makes her way through the gate, shes seen as a human being only by Kirk, who returns her iPhone and boggles at the possibility of her being attracted to him.</p><p>You might feasibly expectindeed, hope forthis to play out like a zanier <i>Say Anything </i>(judging from Baruchels rawness, he does, too). But were hardly in that romantic ballpark; the promising material, penned by the writers of the underrated <i>Sex Drive,</i> skews closer to Farrelly brothers slapstick than sweetness. One gag involving a loving act of manscaping by a heterosexual friend will make you want to vomit; you sense that<i> The Hangover</i> loomed large over this production. Still, Eve has a true flair for zingers, and the movies heart survives intact. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Fathers know foolishness best in this culture-clash family comedy, which presides over a cursed union of slushy sentimentality and dim-witted humor. Two lovebirds (Gross, Ferrera) wreak havoc among their clans by announcing their intentions to marry. Such news is upsetting to their respective not-so-proud popsa playboy radio personality (Whitaker) and a clingy car restorer (Mencia)who immediately begin volleying racial and class-based insults at each other.<br /></p><p>Paternal bickering and egomaniacal prejudices soon give way to slapstick fighting, which in turn leads to clichd crises (the couple starts to reconsider their relationship, other relatives find love amid the matrimonial chaos) and Kumbaya reconciliations that are as predictable as the scripts intolerant slurs are tame. A variety of peripheral players fulfill the stereotype quota, with African-Americans represented as party-hearty lotharios and Mexicans cast as traditionalist kooks. Aside from an uncomfortable-looking Carlos Mencia, who seems to actively cower before the camera, the cast is robotically efficientthough thats not the same thing as coming out of this lifeless mess unscathed. Itll take years of yeomans work for Forest Whitaker to repair his onscreen reputation after allowing himself to be humped by a runaway goat hopped up on Viagra.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[This years romantic heartthrob, R-Patz  Twilight star Robert Pattinson to those non-fanatics among you  has an executive-producer credit attached to this unobjectionable but slightly arch and sentimentalised 2001-set New York romantic drama. This may suggest an effort on his part to add thespian respect and some rebellious street-cred to his image. If so, he might have chosen a more subtle director than Allen Coulter (Hollywoodland, TVs Nurse Jackie, The Sopranos etc) and a better script than this clichd, strangely humourless effort by newcomer Will Fetters.Nevertheless, the all-important romantic mechanics work well enough. <br />The movies meet-cute occurs at the NYU canteen where conflicted rich kid Tyler (Pattinson) dare-dates overprotected, lone-parented Ally (petite star Emilie de Ravin from Lost) on the prompting of Tylers standard-issue flatmate and gooseberry, Aidan (Tate Ellington). Fate, family loss, father obsession and too much booze have brought them together: Allys cop dad (Chris Cooper, wasted) had previously banged up Tyler for a back-street brawl, which explains the cool-looking bruises the nice but nihilistic 21 year old sports throughout the movie  as well as the angry dads embargo and the curtailment of their brief idyll as the calendar turns fatefully towards September<br />Its a movie that craves much indulgence: Pattinson, playing handsome, mixed-up and misunderstood, is watchable enough but he aint no Olivier; while de Ravin bears her straitjacket role of pretty, sweet and wise with good grace. But, be warned, if youre vulnerable to outrageous, cringe-inducing implausibilities  not least the ludicrous stand-up row between Tyler and his father in the latters Twin Towers boardroom  youd best give this one a miss.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Once upon a time, a nebbishy New Yorker could fall for a willowy shiksa goddess and you could call it <i>Annie Hall.</i> No longer. Now, the whole movies got to be set in Los Angeles (not just one Christmas sequence), our love object barely gets a single la-di-da, and forget about naming the film after her. Weve got inner male pain to address.<br /></p><p>That shift, though, is precisely what makes<i> Greenberg,</i> Noah Baumbachs latest comedy-drama, so car-crash-arresting and emblematic of Gen X self-absorption. Baumbach, an expert at skewering urbane pretensions (<i>The Squid and the Whale</i>), has conceived a remarkably sour character in Ben Stillers furious letter writer and fortyish layabout, Roger Greenberg. Once a college-rock musician, he scotched his bands momentum in a fit of principle and now suffers the consequences: occasional work at carpentry and pride-swallowing in the home of his much wealthier brother. A ratty Steve Winwood T-shirt speaks volumes, as does a shelf of meds and a constant stream of bile directed at partygoing kids who scare him with their potential. Rogers just not fun to be around.</p><p>Baumbachs idea here is to find an expiration date on boyishnessits tempting to compare Greenberg to the more-trenchant <i>The Anniversary Party</i> (2001), also a shrewd examination of the limits of youthful decadence (and partly created by the filmmakers wife, Jennifer Jason Leigh, as is this). This movie corrects its wobbly, negative spiral with the romantic development of Florence (Gerwig, spacey as ever), a personal assistant to Rogers sib and perhaps a salvation. Scratch that perhaps: <i>Greenberg</i> only slightly misses the top flight by settling for too weak a foil. (The better option, Rhys Ifanss bruised bandmate, is right there.) But when Stiller indulges in moments of unfulfilled rage, this has real desperation. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For the past year, 3D has been a guarantee of box-office gold, as proven by the runaway success of Avatar. But now, for the first time, a film arrives for which the 3D element may prove to be a commercial hindrance. Its not only that Clash of the Titans will compete with Alice in Wonderland, How to Train Your Dragon and Avatar for the nations 3D screens. More critically than that, the film's conversion to 3D (a decision taken late in the filmmaking process) has rendered this campy, unashamedly old-school but still highly enjoyable blockbuster rather painful to watch.<br />In story terms, Clash of the Titans doesn't stray too far from the beloved 1981 Ray Harryhausen classic which spawned it. The setting is mythical Ancient Greece  an age of Gods, monsters and muscular men in little chainmail skirts. Sam Worthington is Perseus, an orphaned demi-God drawn into the battle between man and the immortals when Hades (Ralph Fiennes), lord of the underworld, threatens to unleash his great sea-beast, the Kraken, on the city of Argos. Accompanied by a ragtag band of warriors, Perseus sets off to learn the secrets of the Kraken and end the reign of the Gods once and for all.<br />Theres no ignoring the fact that Clash of the Titans is a mess: the plot is episodic and rushed, the dialogue blunt and occasionally laughable, and there are far too many characters, few of whom leave much of an impression. Both Worthington and love interest Gemma Arterton look like theyre on a strenuous Aegean package holiday, but luckily theyre surrounded by the likes of Fiennes, Pete Postlethwaite and Liam Neeson as Zeus, whose commanding, armour-clad presence seems, at times, to be the only thing holding this crumbling edifice together.<br />Other notable names dont fare so well: Danny Huston gets a mighty fake beard but just one line as sea-God Poseidon, Mads Mikkelsen does little more than bare his teeth as burly swordsman Draco and, most egregiously, Jason Flemyng gets a terrific backstory and some superb melting-face makeup as ruined ruler Calibos  and that's it. It's is a recurring problem throughout the film: with dialogue and character motivation cut back to the bare minimum, theres no way for anyone to express themselves except through action.<br />But, luckily, this is where Clash of the Titans succeeds. Whatever the flaws in the script, theres no faulting director Louis Leterriers visual ambition: this is a film of mighty vistas, beautifully designed beasts and intense, well-structured combat sequences, all rendered in eye-popping, though still rather fake-looking, CGI. Taking the lessons of The Lord of the Rings to heart, Leterrier goes all-out for excess: his computer-generated camera soars above sprawling cities, endless deserts and blasted underworld hellscapes, lending the film a dizzying, epic scale.<br />A shame, then, that the addition of 3D has rendered much of this grandeur all but unwatchable, blurring the image to a headache-inducing degree and adding absolutely nothing to a film which was obviously shot in two dimensions and should have stayed that way. As an experiment in high-Hollywood style over substance, Clash of the Titans is a very entertaining ride. But take our advice: sidestep the 3D and see it the old fashioned way. <br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Wasnt it only yesterday that Dakota Fanning shrieked her way into your splitting headache in <i>War of the Worlds</i>? She was just 11 back then, and in this fast-and-loose dramatization of the flameout of the 1970s proto-grrrl group, shes all of 15. Fannings costar, vamp bait Kristen Stewart, isnt that much more experienced (she can vote). The two make for an uncomfortably tarted-up frontline as, respectively, blond yowler Cherie Currie and future-bad-reputation-disregarder Joan Jett. Its exactly as it should be; the bands story is a cautionary one. So if you feel yourself getting protective, the movie is doing its job.</p><p>The two underage characters meet, naturally, in a bar over drinks, shoved together by creepy L.A. entrepreneur Kim Fowley (<i>Revolutionary Road</i>s Shannon, the only truly anarchic presence in the whole film). Soon enough, theyre crammed into a motor home with the rest of the band, working on chord ch-ch-changes and sliding inexorably toward drugs, soft-core lesbian sex and Japanese fame. As styled by video director Floria Sigismondi, the film mainly glances on these surfacesits more giggly goofy than coke-in-the-bathroom naughty. (Only vinyl collectors will insist that a serious legacy has been sullied; the plot is as contrived as the group itself.)So you dont blink an eye when the prefab wheels run off the railstheres very little pathos here for something presumably informed by Curries 1989 memoir. Still, you do get a sense of the moment when glam was being fought out in American high schools, and teen sex was barely contained in tight pants. Theres lots of volume in these tunesthe soundtrack is killerand at least everyone gets their rocks off. <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Who would think that a sleepy seaside snippet of the Bronx could foster a Faulkner novels worth of family skeletons? Vince Rizzo (Garcia) is a prison warden guarding two big secrets from his family: a moonlighting stint as an aspiring actor, and Tony (Strait), a grown son from a past fling who shows up as an inmate. Our guilt-ridden everyman takes probationary custody of his close-relations convict, setting off a chain of mishaps: Tony proceeds to make eyes at both Vinces wife (Margulies) and his teen daughterwhos secretly stripping to pay for collegewhile urging Vinces teen son to indulge his online fetish for obese women.</p><p>Somehow, writer-director Raymond De Felitta pulls off these proceedings way better than anyone has a right to, thanks to his light touch with potentially lurid plot developments and his generosity in letting actors flesh out their sitcom setups. Strait, a heartthrob in the making, almost steals the film from Garcia, who channels outer-borough local affably, if a bit thickly. Theres an inevitable clusterfuck climax of accumulated secrets that explode into histrionics, but what precedes the heavily accented sturm und drang is handled with delightful deft.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The 3D bandwagon keeps rolling with this smart, muscular, animated adventure. On a remote North Atlantic island, the Viking population is suffering harassment from swarms of marauding dragons, until geeky son-of-a-chief Hiccup finds an injured dragon in the woods and suspects this constant state of warfare may be unnecessary.<br />Rejecting the comic whimsy of Cressida Cowells source novel, How to Train Your Dragon is a surprisingly robust affair, backing its juggernaut narrative with a well-judged and timely political subtext which urges young viewers to question received wisdom and make up their own minds, especially when it comes to matters of life and death. The voices can be jarring  the burly adult Vikings are all Scots, while their offspring are whiny Yanks  and the characterisation remains disappointingly old fashioned and unoriginal. But the visuals are striking, the script sharp and well paced and it all wraps up with a breathtaking aerial battle sequence.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Alongside last month’s <i>Repo Men</i>, <i>The Joneses</i>
belongs in a group of better-living satires that lack a grasp of
rudimentary economics. To give away no more than the press materials
do: Say you dressed up a group of actors as a fake family, giving each
one a set of products to hawk over several months. How much would you
pay them? How many items could they sell relative to that price? How
long could you keep it up before your company went bust (or at least
got buried in union grievances)?</p><p>Set in an alternate universe
where viral marketing seems to have never harnessed the power of the
Internet, this amusing but benign send-up outdoes <i>The Truman Show</i> in sheer quaintness (and makes <i>The Stepford Wives</i>
look edgy). Needless to say, not all is paradise when Demi Moore’s sales
unit (“dad” David Duchovny, along with “kids” Amber Heard and Ben Hollingsworth) moves
into a McSuburb and begins to show off its golf clubs and reheated
gourmet food, which the neighbors immediately purchase in kind. There’s
no such thing as the perfect family, and conscience often comes into
conflict with capitalism: Unless these are revelations, <i>The Joneses</i>
is an exercise in inevitability, with a late-breaking development that
suggests a classic case of a screenwriter seeking a hasty exit. Moore
and Duchovny are more likable than they’ve been in some time. The movie
they’re in, however, may inspire buyer’s remorse.</p>]]></review>

But this low-key Italian charmer, which is more of a touching, humorous short story than a fully fleshed novel, takes that idea to extreme lengths. Writer-director Gianni Di Gregorio (one of the writers on last years Gomorrah, but dont expect any guns here) plays Gianni, a placid Roman in his fifties who lives with his elderly mum Valeria (Valeria De Franciscis), a refined 80 year old who always looks like shes dressed for dinner at the Ritz back in 1963.<br /><br />This loving pair live in a comfortable city-centre apartment, surrounded by good furniture and knickknacks accumulated over many years, but we know they have little cash as the manager of their building comes knocking, wondering when theyre going to pay their service charges. In place of a cheque, Gianni agrees to look after the managers mother for the weekend. However, when the mother, Grazia, turns up, she has another relative, Maria, in tow. Within hours, Gianni has also agreed to take care of Marina, his doctors mother, which means hell be spending the mid-August holiday (ferragosto) in the company of four women with a combined age of around 350.<br /><br />Its a bit of a stretch to call this a comedy, even though it puts a warm grin on your face from beginning to end. The real beauty of the film lies in how Di Gregorio quietly realises the relationships between Gianni and the four women. These ladies might need a bit of looking after, but they still like to talk about boys, eat good food and even, in one case, wander off in the middle of the night for a furtive drink.<br /><br />Underlying this amiable, thoughtful film is an assumption that age should bring with it respect  and however exasperated he gets, Gianni abides by this code completely. Oddly, the film reminded me a little of Curb Your Enthusiasm, partly because Gianni, with his silly domestic horse-trading, comes across as a much kinder incarnation of Larry David and partly because it shares a freewheeling concern for the absurdity of the everyday, such as when Gianni has to buy food from a local fisherman to feed his unexpected guests. But this is very much a real and warm enterprise, not least because Di Gregorio extracts such lovely performances from his elderly cast. A treat.</p><p>Click here to read our interview with the director of 'Mid-August Lunch' <br /></p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>If we tell you that this flick is set in a post-apocalyptic
wasteland, you can probably fill in a lot of the blanks: a loner who
walks through the desert, bands of cannibals, rumors of a place thats
green. You know the drill. Its all there in <i>The Book of Eli</i>,
with an overlay of Christian theology, or at least fetishistic
obsession with what may be the last remaining copy of the Bible, thrown
in for good measure. For what it is, its pretty entertaining.</p><p>Those
expecting a lot of action may grumble about the Hughes brothers focus
on ambiance. Sure, Bible-reading wanderer Eli (Washington) unleashes
some mad killing skills. <i>Book of Eli</i> doesnt have the deep attention to the details of post-disaster decay of, say, <i>I Am Legend</i> (<i>Book of Eli</i>s
wasteland is pretty generic), but the Hughes brothers know how to work
a mood and get good performances out of all the players, which is no
small feat in this sort of movie. </p><p>The religious aspects of Gary
Whittas screenplay get a bit overbearing at times, and the last 20
minutes could have been tightened up a bit, but on the whole, this is a
hell of a lot better than most of the post-apocalyptic thrillers weve
seen lately.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Tarantino detractors like to claim he takes nothing seriously, but
even at his most referential, he remains invested in such niceties as
dialogue and character. That’s not the case with his imitators’ movies,
and <i>Kick-Ass</i>—which sometimes plays like <i>Kill Bill</i> without <i>Volume 2</i>’s
moral convolutions—is further proof that comic books don’t necessarily
make good films. (The source is a 2008 Marvel series by Mark Millar.)
Like <i>Sin City</i>, <i>Kick-Ass</i>
is stylized within an inch of its life, a would-be cross between Mickey
Spillane and John Hughes. (In this florid context, even Cage’s lunacy
seems normal.) The hero is an ordinary dweeb (Johnson) who throws on a
costume and calls himself a superhero. But the movie never seems
particularly invested in either his adventures or his romantic
frustrations; it’s an object lesson in the point at which irony crosses
over into nihilism.</p><p>Still, <i>Kick-Ass</i> gains significant
momentum in its second half, once it abandons the arch origin-story
material and starts staking a claim as a straight-up action flick. This
is mainly because it cedes the stage to the hilariously foul-mouthed
and violent Hit Girl (the 13-year-old Moretz—a star is born), a fellow
vigilante tasked with taking down a skyscraper full of goons. A little
inventively choreographed mayhem goes a long way. Give Hit Girl her own
sequel and there may be some genuine kick-assery indeed.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Hyped at Torontos Midnight Madness sidebar as the next frontier in vampire movies, <i>Daybreakers</i> feels only slightly less anemic than an <i>Underworld</i>
sequel. This Australian-produced horror film boasts exactly one
intriguing idea: It takes place in a future world where vampires
outnumber humans, which means the food supply is shrinking, fast. In
the kind of speculative sci-fi invention that <i>Daybreakers</i>
could have used more of, we watch as vampire commuters at a coffee cart
complain about the diluted blood in their Styrofoam cups.</p><p>On the
verge of developing a kind of synthetic blood, a vampire hematologist
(Hawke) winds up in an unlikely alliance with a rogue band of humans,
who may have found an antidote to vampirism. (Dafoe, crossbow in hand,
appears in his most blatant paycheck role since <i>Speed 2</i>.)
With a set of supernatural ground rules that only a screenwriter could
love, they take on the vampire overclass, ruled by an arch and
self-amused CEO (Sam Neill). If most of this seems familiar, thats because
the best elements have been covered in more exciting movies: The
vampire camaraderie and reverse-conversion themes echo those in Kathryn
Bigelows magisterial <i>Near Dark</i> (1987), and the corporate satire feels like a pale shadow of that in George Romeros <i>Land of the Dead</i> (2005). Long before the end credits rise, <i>Daybreakers</i> has exhausted its novelty.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Call it benign ecological paranoia: a hyperawareness of all the garbage and other waste that the average consumer produces. For one year, New Yorker Colin Beavan and his family put this hard-core environmental consciousness into daily practicefrom composting and avoiding excess packaging to eating local and swearing off electricity. As chronicled by Laura Gabbert and Justin Schein, the incremental experiment becomes a good-hearted dip into a total lifestyle choice, with comic relief from spousal friction.</p><p><i>This is Super Size Me</i> inverted. Heres a self-inflicted crusade with good side effects, along with relatable reactions from Beavans caffeine-addicted wife, Michelle. He may be our semi-informed guide, but shes far more engaging as a funny journalist who gamely scooters to work but sneaks the odd disposable cup of coffee. His spouse also says more about how such drastic transformations make a person feela facet that, considering the health benefits of their fresh diet and new exercise habits, is perhaps underplayed.</p><p><i>No Impact Man</i> eventually runs out of gasor rather, pedal-poweras the filmmakers grope for how to cap the Beavans story. If you caught Colin on his extensive media rounds at the time, you might already know the climax. At least the doc avoids harangues, even if it could use a bit more scientific background.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>There are those of us who can watch the brainy Tiny Fey bobble around <i>30 Rock</i>
for hours, and drink up her every self-deprecating zinger like freshly
brewed espresso. (As for the others who dont get herwe understand
Sarah Palin has a new show.) Still, theres no reason Fey, so dynamic
on the small screen, has to get Anistoned out of a proper Hollywood
crossover. <i>Baby Mama</i> (2008) was cringingly mediocre; indeed, one has to cast back to 2004s tangy, Fey-scripted <i>Mean Girls</i> to get a reasonable glimmer of her talent. Even then, we were still watching Lindsay Lohan.</p><p><i>Date Night</i>
isnt going to alter this conundrumit makes you laugh in fits and
starts, but more often it feels toothless and exhausted, the kind of
project that exists to give Ray Liotta work. (The generic script is by <i>Shrek</i>-sequel
scribe Josh Klausner.) Fey is almost perfectly paired with Steve Carell as
bored, married New Jerseyites Claire and Phil: The way they trade quips
and cast snide aspersions at strangers, the actors seem totally
believable as intellectual mates and, more crucially, deeply in danger
of losing intimacy. After stealing a reservation at a clichd-snobby
NYC eatery, the couple are mistaken for blackmailers and pursued by
goons, <i>North by Northwest</i>style, throughout the city.</p><p>You
know where this is going; shouty misadventures in a slow-moving
motorboat, a clamorous car chase and an exclusive sex club will surely
move them out of the most excellent roommates category. When Mark Wahlberg
shows up as a shirtless tech-heavy spyone who can also flirt in
Hebrewhe almost constitutes a joke in himself. But cant there at
least be faster fish for Fey and Carell to shoot in the barrel?</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The story was already old-fashioned in 1948: budding prima ballerina Victoria (Moira Shearer) finds herself torn between the divergent demands of art and heart, as represented by two equally headstrong men  tortured control freak and impresario Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) and lovelorn composer Julian (Marius Goring). When they put aside their differences and collaborate, they produce work of awe-inspiring beauty, but ultimately the simmering tension between them leads to tragedy.<br /></p><p>The realisation that were in the presence of genius comes just a few minutes into The Red Shoes, as a gaggle of eager balletomanes take their places for the inaugural performance of Lermontovs latest masterpiece. They settle into their seats, the roar around them fades, a cheery onscreen ticker reads 45 minutes later, and Michael Powell moves us forward in time without even breaking the shot.These quietly radical directorial flourishes can be found throughout the film and Powells entire canon  but what sets this greatest of all British filmmakers apart from the competition is his refusal to thrust his genius in the audiences face, subsuming his natural showmans flair to the demands of story and character. <br />Until the time comes to cut loose, at which point Powell unleashes the most eyepopping visual extravaganza imaginable. Blending impressionist art and expressionist film, blurring the barriers between theatre and cinema, body and camera, reality and dream, drawing equally on the avant-garde and the classical, the centrepiece ballet is a sequence of sheer, reckless transcendence. Its here that The Red Shoes becomes more than the sum of its hoary old parts, taking flight as the crowning glory of our national cinema.</p>]]></review>

I made him an offer he couldnt refuse; Brando scratching his cheek with his pinky; crosscutting between a christening and the elimination of the Corleones enemies; Pacinos transformation from outsider to head of the family. Its all been praised so lavishly that one cant imagine the film living up to its reputation.</p><p>And yet, it does. From the haunting opening momentsan undertaker appeals to Don Vito Corleone (Brando) for justice, both of them enveloped in darkness so rich you could cut off slices of itCoppola demonstrates absolute control of his material. He and cinematographer Gordon Willis knew the look they wanted, even tweaking the film-development process to up the red and yellow in the final print (giving the film its rich, almost sepia look). It doesnt hurt, of course, that Coppola has a cast thats an embarrassment of riches. Yes, Brando is amazing, but so is everyone. Its worth watching secondary players like Abe Vigoda, Richard S. Castellano and Sterling Hayden, all of whom have great moments. Of course, its hard to find a moment in the film that isnt great. <i>The Godfather</i> lives up to the term <i>masterpiece</i>. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>A few scant pleasures can be had with <i>Repo! The Genetic Opera,</i> a tuneless slab of musical schlock. First comes the sight of Paris Hilton playing the plastic-surgery-obsessed daughter of a future magnate. While singing onstage, her entire face slips off like an especially silky negligee. Yuckbut a fascinating image. Second comes the embarrassing but riveting spectacle of <i>Goodfellas </i>Paul Sorvino crooning as the pungently named Rotti Largo, president of a company that reharvests organs when recipients cant make their payments. Sorvino must think hes doing Puccini. Finally, the inimitable Joan Jett makes a wordless cameo as a guitarist chugging behind some awful caterwauling. Her smirk says it all.</p><p>Working from an underground 2002 stage play, director Darren Lynn Bousman is trying to make the leap from the <i>Saw</i> movies (he did three of them). But he shouldnt be so quick to forget those films crude but effective measures. Bousmans big idea this time is to float the camera around aimlessly. None of his performances come to life, especially sub-Idol talent Alexa Vega as our heroine. Even a singer as experienced as Sarah Brightman is swaddled in distracting makeup and noise. Theres no song in <i>Repo!</i>s heartplus, its disembodied and squashed on the floor. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>The voiceover narration at the beginning of <i>The White Ribbon</i>
offers up the story as a collection of memories that the speaker hopes
will clarify things that happened in our country. Given that the film
is set in Germany just before World War I, and that the narrator is an
old man reflecting on his days as the new teacher in a rural German
village, its clear just what recent events he hopes to explain; the
rise of fascism hovers over the action of the film as a threatened
future and a possible key to understanding the story.</p><p>But does
nascent fascism explain the puzzling incidents that, for a year or so,
disrupt life in this small town? Or is fascism just another symptom?
Things get off to a suitably nasty start when a horse stumbles on a
trip wire someone has strung across the road. Both sinister and
inexplicable, this prank is just the beginning of a season of
motiveless malignity (to borrow Coleridges apt description of Iago). A
child is kidnapped and beaten. A building is burned down. A worker is
killed in a freak workplace accident. All is not well in this seemingly
tranquil, cohesive community.</p><p>Leaving aside that unsettling
voiceover hint about fascism, the film begins with the elements of a
simple mystery: Whos behind all this, and why is it happening? But
Haneke, the man who brought us such dark explorations of the human
heart as <i>The Piano Teacher</i>, <i>Funny Games</i> and <i>Cach</i>, does not traffic in Agatha Christie puzzles with tidy solutions. The answers are more elusive and more troubling.</p><p>One
of the films neatest tricks is the way it plays on the history of
horror. Early on, we are introduced to the blond children of the
village, who move with creepy placidity and uniformity. <i>Children of the Corn</i>,
anyone? But if the children, who we cant help but think are going to
grow up to be adults during the era of Hitler, seem sinister, so do the
adults, especially those in positions of authority. The local baron
treats the villagers like serfs; the doctor is a manipulative jerk who
mistreats the widow with whom he is having a secret sexual
relationship. The pastor ties his sons hands at night to prevent
masturbation. Haneke rejects any idyllic vision of old-fashioned
village life, offering instead the past as an oppressive, barbaric
nightmare ready to give birth to the horrors of fascism.</p><p>But
Haneke eschews easy horror shocks, creating a sense of dread precisely
through the reserve of his filmmaking. No crazy camera angles or
menacing music here; Hanekes approach is almost spartan, often
shooting interiors by candlelight and relying on long takes and minimal
use of close-ups to keep the story at a bit of a distance. </p><p>Adding
to the aestheticization of the story is Hanekes choice to make the
film in black and white. He shot in color, since black-and-white film
is virtually impossible to get, and then digitally converted the images
to black and white. As Haneke has noted in interviews, this was no
casual choice; he and his crew, used to color film, had to learn a
whole new cinematic vocabulary. It was worth the effort. </p><p>The
overall effect of Hanekes refusal to sensationalize is that we are
given a lot of room to think, and the things Haneke urges us to think
about are not very nice. Though <i>The White Ribbon</i> may not clarify the origins of fascism, it opens a door on the cruelties large and small of which we are all capable.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Its impossible to describe <i>My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done</i>
without making it sound like an ingenious prank. (Then again, maybe
thats what its supposed to be.) A Werner Herzog noir! Produced by
David Lynch! Starring Michael Shannon as a San Diego man who goes crazy
after a white-water rafting trip and, influenced by his role as Orestes
in a local theater production, kills his mother (Zabriskie) with a
sword! With Willem Dafoe playing the detective who investigates!
Featuring supporting turns by Chlo Sevigny and Udo Kierthe latter as
a theater director whose glasses are eaten by an ostrich!</p><p>If the
nonstop parade of weirdness suggests Herzog is pulling a fast one,
theres a case to be made that Shannons character is just another in a
long line of the directors real-life-inspired eccentrics. (Nicolas
Cages post-Katrina bad lieutenant is only the latest addition to a
gallery of Klaus Kinski figures.) But even if Herzogs intentions are
sincere, his filmmaking has never seemed more slapdash or clumsy, and
his commitment to capturing unmitigated peculiarity has led to
performances so stilted that some of the characters seem to have
wandered in from the storefront play theyre rehearsing. As Shannon
rolls a can of oatmeal at the cops, its difficult not to wonder if the
movie was made on a dare.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>In Bremen, Germany, a middle-aged Turkish prostitute called Yeter (Kse) says goodbye to Ali (Kurtiz), an elderly Turkish john, in their native tongue. The exchange is overheard by puritanical Muslim thugs, who warn Yeter to repent. The confrontation motivates Yeter to reconsider Alis offer to support her as his live-in courtesan. Initially, Ali seems like an affable old rogue, but booze brings out his dark side, and the mnage ends in fatal tragedy.</p><p>Hoping to atone for his fathers violence, Alis son Nejat (Davrak), an introverted academic, travels to Istanbul to search for Yeters daughter Ayten (Yesilay). Ayten, however, has fled to Bremen to seek her mother and escape arrest for belonging to a left-wing revolutionary sect. In Bremen, Ayten falls in love with Lotte (Ziolkowska), an open-hearted university student, who, under the sorrowful gaze of her mother (Schygulla, in a miraculous return), absorbs Aytens passionate but nebulous political commitments, thus setting the stage for further catastrophe.</p><p>Turkish-German director Akins previous feature, <i>Head-On</i>, struck us as a histrionic mess. Similar insofar as they both address themes of cultural hybridity, <i>Head-On</i> and <i>Edge</i> could otherwise scarcely be less alike: <i>Edge</i> is a mature, stately, emotionally authentic and beautifully acted drama superior to anything weve seen this year. And dont listen to anyone who compares it to <i>Babel</i>.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Adapting Cormac McCarthys grim post-apocalyptic novel <i>The Road</i>
for the screen is the sort of thing an unwise filmmaker would do on a
dare. The power of McCarthys writing comes from his control of
language, which moves with ease between the terse stripped-down clarity
of Hemingway and richer, more lyrical passages. On the screen, at least
in Hillcoats hands, the mix of despair and philosophical musing on
hope feels false and forced.</p><p>A man (Mortensen) and his son
(Smit-McPhee) are walking across the dying American landscape some
years after an unspecified event has killed most animals and plants.
Theyre headed south, toward the coast, in hopes that things might be
better there. The man still believes in the fire, that inner spark
that symbolizes both basic humanity and the will to survive. He tries
to teach this principle to his son, but the farther they go, the more
the mans moral compass is tested. If surviving means losing your
humanity, is it worth surviving at all?</p><p>Hillcoat wants to be
bleak and astringent, but somehow the profundity has been bleached out.
Images that should be haunting are paraded before us, one after
another, and you can almost feel the film straining to convey its
significance.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Shot without government permission in a remote part of China, <i>Ghost Town</i>
is about as handmade as filmmaking comes. Divided into three
sectionsVoices, Recollections and Innocencethis gently aestheticized
documentary doesnt so much mount an argument as seek to immerse
viewers in the rhythms of life in the village of Zhiziluo, economically
depressed and sorting out conflicting ideals in the post-Mao era.</p><p>The
first section, focusing on the villages Christian community, will
likely be the most novel even for those who have followed the career of
Jia Zhangkeanother filmmaker who has sought to document Chinese lives
left behind in the push toward modernization. The church serves as a
glue for the town, which was heavily Christianized after missionaries
arrived around 1930. Bogging down in oral histories, the films middle
hour rambles slightly, showing a recurring interest in the economic
constraints of marriage. But neither chapter is adequate preparation
for the hypnotic last section, which follows La Xiaolong, a 12-year-old
boy abandoned by his parents at a young age, who scrapes together a
bare-bones existence hunting for his own food and squatting in
abandoned buildings. The film finds unlikely poetry in his story, seemingly
one of utter hopelessness, and uses it to bring this epic portrait full
circle.</p>]]></review>

casts the towering performer as Eliot Deacon, a soft-spoken mortician
with the ability to talk to the recently deceased. Its never entirely
confirmed if his very particular set of skills is genuine or the
elaborate cover of a serial killer; suffice it to say that when
schoolteacher Anna Taylor (a necrolicious Christina Ricci) crosses his slab,
theres a lot of impassioned hemming and hawing about whether shes
dead or alive.</p><p>Deacon cleverly talks around the facts of her case
with the kind of mock-philosophical misdirection (Only I can see you

is different: Neeson clearly relishes the role, but he never plays to
the cheap seats by going whole-hog psychotic. The characters
motivations remain tantalizingly opaque from first frame to last.</p><p>Would
that writer-director Wojtowicz-Vosloo brought the same sense of
tightrope-traversing rigor (minus mortis) to the rest of the film.
Ricci is certainly game, baring body and soul in her scenes with
Neeson. But two subplotsone involving Annas bereaved boyfriend, Paul

narrative deadweight. This is one case where theres more life in the

Give him a speech in which he takes a scalpel to the heart of our
sentimentality and Clooney is at his finest. He gets just such a speech
in <i>Up in the Air</i>. When hes not jetting from company to
company firing people as a consultant, Ryan Bingham has a nice little
sideline in motivational speaking. His standard spiel is about
unpacking our backpacks; he imagines all the things that weigh us
down, like possessions, friends, family, emotional connections. Ryan,
of course, has eschewed all that in favor of the life of a Zen road
warrior chalking up frequent-flier miles. Its terrific fun watching
him rupture the navet of Natalie (Kendrick), a young up-and-comer at
work whose efficiency-minded proposals threaten his happy existence in
the skies. </p><p>You probably sense a but coming up, and indeed <i>Up in the Air</i>
cant avoid the inevitable punishment that awaits anyone in American
culture who does not embrace family and love and marriage and all that
crap. The pleasant surprise is that the screenplay (by Reitman and
Sheldon Turners screenplay from a novel by Walter Kirn) makes its
concessions to sentiment so halfheartedly. One of the joys of <i>Up in the Air</i>
is the no-strings relationship between Ryan and another frequent flier
(Farmiga) who seems equally detachedits like watching beautiful
sharks mate. Reitmans eye for satire is as sharp as it was in <i>Thank You for Smoking</i>, and our only regret is that the movie makes any concessions at all to the conventions of Hollywood. Bring on the sharks.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Since the 1960s, twin brothers George and Mike Kuchar have been
incredibly prolific filmmakers (“I don’t think anybody even knows how
many works George has made,” muses Anthology Film’s Andrew Lampert).
Their works, and especially those of the more prolific George, form the
ultra-low-budget bridge between the glossy melodramas of Douglas Sirk
and the trash aesthetic of John Waters. A typical Kuchar film might mix
a love story, a horror plot and some family melodrama. In this
enjoyable doc, director Jennifer M. Kroot shows enough clips that even a newbie can get a
sense of the Kuchar aesthetic, but she places the clips in a
traditional doc framework (interviews with friends and fans, a clear
chronology of their lives and clips are doled out in equal measure).</p><p>Kroot
also gives us a sense of ultra-gregarious George and more introverted
Mike. Raised strict Catholics in the Bronx, the Kuchars both bring a
strange mix of fascination and guilt to the subject of sex, which comes
up in all their films in one way or another. But what doesn’t come up
in a Kuchar film? For them, it’s not enough to include the kitchen
sink; they have to throw in the toilet too, if only to violate
Hollywood’s decorum. While capturing the weird mix of awe, amusement
and boredom that any Kuchar film can evoke, Kroot gives these
godfathers of the underground film movement the respect they deserve.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Rowan Isaacson is an autistic child whose parents take him on a journey through Mongolia to visit with a variety of shamans. The hope is less for a cure than for a balancing out of the childs disruptive behavior, which the presence of horses (a Mongolian spiritualist staple) tends to alleviate. <i>The Horse Boy </i>comes off as both an edifying work of advocacy and an invasive home movie. Mostly, as with the thematically comparable (and superior) doc <i>Praying with Lior,</i> the film gets by on the sheer adorableness of its subject.<br />]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Kicks, punches, pratfalls, head smacks, tumbles and free falls galore: A parade of pain dominates <i>Kung Fu Panda</i>, which forgoes the rigors of character development for lazy, bone-crunching mayhem. A few clever lines of dialogue give occasional respite from the cacophony and hint at genuine emotion, but the focus always returns to concussive superficiality.</p><p>The halfhearted attempt at a story focuses on Po (Black), a softheaded, soft-bellied panda who dreams of being worthy enough to battle alongside the Furious Fivenot Grandmaster Flashs rap posse but a quintet of fearsome martial artists. Each hopes to be chosen as the Dragon Warrior, a legendary fighter entrusted with the ancient secrets of the much-heralded Dragon Scroll. A firecracker blunder catapults Po smack into a celebrated selection process, where he becomes the Chosen One. An accident, you say? There are no accidents, calmly insists ancient turtle Oogway (Kim), who apparently invented kung fu and doles out wisdom like fortune cookies.</p><p>The animation veers from dazzling (particularly in an opening sequence deeply indebted to Genndy Tartakovskys wildly superior cartoon saga, <i>Samurai Jack</i>) to merely mechanical, showing only sporadic visual flair but, like much of the movie, otherwise content to revel in its conventional invention.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Who wants to see an avant-garde feminist masterpiece, other than feminists and the avant-garde? You should. Dont be spooked by the daunting length, the formalist mise-en-scne, or the fact that great chunks of screen time are devoted to potato peeling and dish washing. <i>Jeanne Dielman</i> is immersion cinema, a brilliant example of maximal minimalism that fuses viewer with subject so profoundly, the marathon experience transcends simple spectatorship.</p><p>Two and a half days pass in the life of a Belgian widow (Seyrig), who methodically fixes meals, cleans the house, tends to her teenage son (Decorte), goes on errandsoh, and whores herself in the afternoons. Sure, the films cinematic strategies, gender agenda and postwar condemnation of petite bourgeoisie forever tether it to the Me Decade. But <i>Jeanne Dielman</i> is far more than a political screed; its statements about the human condition, about our fears and frailties and the veneer of convention over a cauldron of regret and self-denial, are as universal and timeless as Greek tragedy.</p><p><i>Jeanne Dielman</i> plays like a slow-motion thriller. After all the stylized repetition of chores, a sudsy plate or a dropped knife is enough to chill the blood. Life is maintenance, and that maintenance is a form of both preservation and asphyxiation. Its the menial tasks and ritual errands that shield the soul from existential crisis, but they can also form the wall that prevents emotional engagement. And Jeanne Dielmans quiet desperation will speak volumes to every new generationas long as theyre willing to watch. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Although based on the real-life tale of nine underage underdogs from
Monterrey, Mexico, who swept the 1957 Little League World Series, this
Cinderella sports story rings false from first pitch to last. Boys
can’t just be boys here—they need to be pint-size saints, keeping the
faith and crusading against racism. With God fully on our side—the
Christian sermonizing leans heavily on vague, theologically dubious
suggestions of divine baseball providence—there’s not even a
swing-and-a-miss threat to the preordained outcome.</p><p>Recently
fired MLB janitor Cesar (Collins) retreats South of the Border to
booze, scowl and don a wifebeater, until a kid named Angel (!)
strong-arms him into coaching the town’s fledgling ball team. Along
with the local priest (Marin), Cesar shepherds them to the promised
lands—otherwise known as Texas and Kentucky—and then to the
championship, where the film belabors its namesake. Dear, apparent king
of baseball devotionals (<i>Angels in the Outfield</i>, <i>The Sandlot 3</i>),
betrays no understanding or respect for how the game is actually
played: He harps on home-run money shots in which balls limply fly as
if they were being controlled by string, remote control or the ghost of
Ed Wood. <i>The Perfect Game</i> courts its target demos like a
leg-humping hound, but sports fans, believers, Latinos and even
wanna-be Willie Mayses can find fellowship elsewhere.</p>]]></review>

But the 20-year-old Hubble Space Telescopewhose repair mission is the subject of this chronicleturns out to be a bit of a stage hog, and audiences expecting a blissout of swirling galaxies will wonder why so much time is spent on astronauts sweating over screws and bolts.</p><p>Of course, just about anything looks fairly impressive blown up to brownstone-size, and the movie offers a mlange of material: astrofolk training underwater, an earthshaking rocket launch, living-quarter antics and artful computer visualizations of Hubbles crown-jewel data. (Its a mix of footage from both the early 1990s and last years sortie, stirred together and haphazardly upgraded to bigger-faster-better 3D status.) Things perk up once the telescopes findings start sending a thousand points of light hurling at usthough these cotton-candy nebulae and whirligig baby stars are each laden with the multiplying cosmic-slop metaphors of Leonardo DiCaprios voiceover. Despite the astronauts bravery and good humor, their work on the Hubble, captured in cluttered shots, is not nearly as exciting as the brave new frontiers conjured up by the term <i>spacewalk.</i> But even if this stroll through the heavens isnt as immersive as, say, the recent Deep Sea IMAX, its still a trip. </p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Proving that a comedy’s performers are sometimes more important than
its jokes, this remake of Frank Oz’s dreary 2007 British farce of the
same name livens up the proceedings by subbing in a comic
African-American all-star cast. As before, the setting is a deceased
family patriarch’s services, which are spearheaded by the dutiful
oldest son (Rock) and his hotshot-author younger brother (Lawrence);
all manner of romantic, sibling-rivalry and cross-generational
wackiness ensues, mostly of the strained <i>Three’s Company</i> variety.</p><p>Nude,
hallucinogen-fueled jaunts on rooftops, revelations about same-sex
relationships—with a little person, no less—and individuals covered in
feces are all executed with verve by the typically misanthropic LaBute.
It’s his formidable cast (which also includes Luke Wilson, Peter
Dinklage, James Marsden and Danny Glover) that really keeps things
moving, though its ability to generate postmortem yuks by brute comedic
force never quite compensates for the middling slapstick nature of the
high jinks and an overreliance on easy poop and gay-panic gags. Still,
this <i>Death</i> laps the original, laugh-wise, and is LaBute’s
second-funniest film to date, trailing only his unintentionally
amusing, WTF cover version of <i>The Wicker Man</i>.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>This doc profiles 90-year-old dance artist (and Winnetka native)
Anna Halprin after a wave of renewed interest in her work that began in
Europe about five years ago. While this isn’t exactly a hagiography,
numerous cuts point to friction in her creative partnerships—most
notably with John Graham and A. A. Leath—without following up. The end
result is a standard-issue dance film that suggests drama only to demur
on grounds of maintaining the sanctity of its subject. (Halprin’s
daughter Daria remembers “longing to be like the so-called normal kids”
in 1960 while we see Graham prancing around with the then-ten-year-old
high over his head. She recalls discomfort with the riskiness of the
performance but, tellingly, her mother doesn’t comment, and Anna and
Daria never appear in the same frame.)</p><p>Director Ruedi Gerber offsets his
timidity with a treasure trove of archival material. Merce Cunningham
is captured on film during a West Coast homecoming, and a montage of
clips from <i>Ceremony of Us—Right On!</i> (1968) offers a
fascinating close-up on experimental community healing in the wake of
the Watts riots. Halprin’s conflicted relationship with the dance world
is increasingly pushed to the foreground, as it apparently has been in
life; the earthbound story of Bay Area modern dance that ran
perpendicular to New York formalism is the true subject here, and
Halprin is, more than anyone else, its author.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>A diamond in the rough is elevated from poverty, taken under the
wing of a taskmaster, schooled in rarefied classical technique, and
escapes fate to become prodigal, inspiring greatness in friends and
family back home. Aided significantly by its subject’s sincerity and
talent and a supporting cast of ballet luminaries, director Anne Bass’s portrait of
Cambodian-born dancer Sokvannara Sar mostly cheats this minefield of
clichés despite painting it by numbers.</p><p>The doc’s core is Sar’s
relationship with teacher Olga Kostritzky, who, after Sar is initially
denied entrance to the School of American Ballet, brings him up to
speed in a matter of months. (As a former student of Kostritzky’s, I
can attest that this feat, while dubious, is indeed possible.) Sar
finds work with Seattle’s Pacific Northwest Ballet, reaches the
semifinal round at the “ballet Olympics” in Varna, Bulgaria, and shares
a stage in Vail with Philip Glass; as PNB artistic director Peter Boal
puts it, his story had a one in a thousand chance of working out, and
did.</p><p>Bass herself discovered Sar at a Khmer folk-dance
performance during a trip to Siem Reap, brought him to the U.S.,
presumably underwrote his private lessons, and produced this
documentary, but doesn’t much get into why; her film moves the most
when Sar wonders aloud about the path she placed him on.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Wed never have believed we would react to an Almodvar film with a
shrug, but there it is. All the trappings of Almodvar are there: the
pretty colors and florid melodrama of his early work, the
cine-fetishism and Hitchcockian twists of plotting of his later work.
But <i>Broken Embraces</i> doesnt feel like a Greatest Hits album; its more like a cover-band version of an Almodvar film.</p><p>A
blind amnesiac screenwriter, who now goes only by his old nom de plume
Harry Caine (Homar), gets drawn into recalling his past by the death of
a financier and the probing questions of his agents son (Novas).
Harry, we learn, was once the film director Mateo Blanco. He was in
love with Lena (Cruz), but she was tangled up with Mateos wealthy but
sinister backer (Gmez). Meanwhile, in the present day, Harry/Mateo has
to deal with a mysterious filmmaker who wants something from him.</p><p>The
further we descend into this maze, the more references to other films
pop up. Here comes a bit of Hitchcock (the untrustable woman), and
theres some Douglas Sirk (the general air of melodrama). Hey, is that
a Michael Powell reference in the way Mateo uses his camera like a
weapon? And the movie Mateo was making looks like a parody of
Almodvars own <i>Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown</i>. By the end, we couldnt quite untangle the plot twists and all the cinematic references, but, more troubling, we didnt care.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Old Coot cinema seems the inescapable endgame for any venerable actor (see Peter OToole in <i>Venus</i> and Clint Eastwood in <i>Gran Torino,</i> for two recent examples), so watching Hal Holbrook play the steely geezer du jour feels more inevitable than surprising. Its a calculatedly unflattering stock role: a forlorn yet feisty man at the end of his years, who first resists and then comes to terms with a checkered life. Hes the kind of grandfatherly presence who connects with the younger generation (often represented by a girl emerging from her shy teen years) by giving them the courage to face their own demons; redeemed, he can then gird himself to shuffle off this mortal coil.</p><p>Adapting Southern author William Gays short story, writer-director Scott Teems suffuses <i>That Evening Sun </i>with a palpable regional languor that gives his fairly simple script more elegiac weight than it earns. Holbrooks Abner Meecham squats on his former farm estate (now being sold to a man he considers white trash) and has little to do but squint and grunt at the indignity. The grizzled veteran actor, naturally, elevates the material like a pro, yet the entire exercise feels thin and reedy, trading in geriatric sentiment instead of hard-forged emotion. <br /></p>]]></review>

The animal chews and chews for what seems like several minutes, then suddenly stops and looks smack-dab into the camera for an uncomfortably long time. Its tempting to imagine the creature is endowed with human emotions, but the truth is that theres nothing in its dead-eyed gaze beyond involuntary instinct. </p><p>Thats the perfect note on which to begin <i>Sweetgrass,</i> which turns out to be a requiem for a lost way of life. Beginning in 2001, Barbash and Castaing-Taylor filmed a family of sheepherderswhose business is now defuncttaking the animals into the mountains for summer pasture. As subcultural anthropology, its unassailable. Yet the often ugly-looking DV aesthetic dilutes the cumulative effect. For every gorgeously low-res image (a blobby, white sea of sheep racing heedlessly toward their pen), theres a correspondingly ineffectual visual or vista that one wishes had been captured with higher-end equipment and a keener cinematic eye.</p>]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[<p>Movements need anthems, and the fight for civil rights in the 50s and 60s had some amazing ones: We Shall Overcome, Eyes on the Prize, Aint Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around. These songs gave everyday men and women the power to stand up and the fortitude to not stand down. You can credit Bill Guttentag and Dan Sturmans documentary for reminding us about just what these freedom fighters had to endure: public humiliations, police brutality and constant threats of physical violence. Even if youve seen this footage of the sit-ins at Southern diners, the Selma-to-Montgomery marches and Martin Luther King Jr.s funeral before, you cant help but be moved to your core. For anyone who is either ignorant of or has simply forgotten the extent to which broken bones and unbowed heads paved the way for the Obama Age, its a much-needed history lesson.</p><p>But only the revolution itself gets the necessary rigorous attention; the actual soundtrack, ostensibly the focus, is treated like a footnote. Songs are mentioned and praised by talking heads, lyrics are presented as graphic text, then theyre summarily dismissed; any deeper notions about the who, where and why behind these gospel and folk tunes are largely left on the cutting-room floor. And far be it from us to pass up seeing the Roots or John Legend perform, but the idea that watching todays performers interpret inspiring standards can camouflage lazy musicology is, frankly, misguided at best. </p>]]></review>

Hes certainly a <i>Jew</i>-hating Jew. <br /></p><p>Other voices add to the complexity: an intellectual endorsement from former mentor Noam Chomsky (in a weird Kennedyesque photo, we see the two of them boating); a harsh slam from Harvards Alan Dershowitz, a sustained target of Finkelsteins critiques. Then theres the subject himself, the child of death-camp survivors. Unrepentant at the podium, he brings even mild-mannered Canadians to tears with his anti-Zionist screeds. Hes a bit of a showboat.<br /></p><p>With impressive restraint, the fascinatingly thorny<i> American Radical </i>is less interested in the validity of Finkelsteins ideasseriously mounted, if inflammatoryand more in the topsy-turvy life of todays professional academic. Amazingly, that choice doesnt result in a boring movie: We see student protests at Chicagos DePaul University in 2007 after Finkelstein is denied tenure (hes bounced among five different schools) and sit with the man in the back of a car as he wearily suggests that if his polemics were just about money, hed be smarter to change fields. His own worst enemy, Finkelstein has both trouble and tragic writ large on his brow.<br /></p>]]></review>
