Art decides to use inheritance money to pay for Canadian therapist Dr. Levi Ellington to come to his home in England and help Art "be more normal," about which his parents are less than thrilled.

      <review><![CDATA[DreamWorks 3-D interpretation of Cressida Cowells tale is fast-flying fun. But admirers of the source material may be caught off guard, because the movie has little in common with the 2004 novel. Even the basic premise has been changed: In the book, Vikings domesticate dragons; in this version, they destroy them.  Teen outcast Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) is a disappointment to his father, Stoick (Gerard Butler), the leader of a Viking tribe plagued by murderous fire-breathers. Trying to make his papa proud, Hiccup attempts to slaughter a monster, but ends up befriending him instead. It turns out that the beasts are just misunderstood. Cue a romance between a fellow dragon-slayer trainee (America Ferrera) and Hiccup, plus a scaly showdown and reconciliations between father and son (and between dragon and man).  Despite its formulaic unfolding, the film transcends banality through heartfelt performances and awesome CGI effects. And just think: After the flicks done, you can buy the book and enjoy a new story. Thats one upside to such an unfaithful adaptation. Raven Snook]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Theres tons of brooding for your buck in the hilariously earnest Remember Me, which will hopefully be revived several years from now as a beloved midnight movie. Twilight inamorato Robert Pattinson (star and executive producer) confidently sulks his way through this jaw-dropping mix of come-hither stares, love me, Daddy! histrionics and historical tragedy. Hes Tyler Hawkins, a gloomily soulful NYU student at odds with his businessman father (Brosnan), and who cracks Boyz II Men jokes as if he were Allen Ginsberg reading Howl. After getting into a street fight, hes arrested by a policeman (Cooper) whoit just so happenshas a daughter (De Ravin) also enrolled at NYU. One alpha-male bet with his roommate later, Tylers on a retributive datebut then love begins to bloom.  Sex is had, past secrets are revealed, but all is not well in Camelot, as director Allen Coulter and writer Will Fetters shamelessly hint via snatches of summer 2001 news broadcasts (its a period piece, see) and a telegraphing glimpse at a certain pair of buildings. I cant say any more beyond telling you that I came out of the screening with an ear-to-ear grin I dont usually get from even great movies. Bless you, R.Patz &amp; Co., because this gloriously steaming pile is officially in the bad-movies-we-love pantheon. Keith Uhlich]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Russia, 1910. In his old age, Leo Tolstoy has become so famous worldwide that the merest hint hes about to pop his clogs sends newsreel cameras gathering in anticipation. The real story though, as this slightly fusty drama elaborates, is unfolding inside the Tolstoy household, where the octogenerian writer (Christopher Plummer, authentically beardy) finds himself in the centre of a dispute over the valuable publishing rights to War and Peace. The Tolstoyan political movement  an organisation espousing his ideas on communal property to combat social injustice  sense a major funding opportunity should Tolstoy sign his best-known book over to their leader Chertkov (Paul Giamatti), yet Tolstoys aristocratic wife Sofya (Helen Mirren), having delivered him 13 children, is determined to fight her corner to the bitter end. Idealism versus family ties makes for a potentially juicy set-to, yet its the historical detail which keeps this adaptation of Jay Parinis novel relatively intriguing, rather than merely stodgy. Writer-director Michael Hoffman is all reverence towards Tolstoy himself, but curiously supercilious towards the beliefs of the Tolstoyan movement, thus undermining the key subplot (eager young acolyte James McAvoy gets his dream job as the great mans secretary, but must also spy on him) and unfairly loading the central conflict in favour of ferocious spouse Mirren. Her impressively projected performance becomes the dominating factor, causing Plummer to overdo it, and sidelining both the earnestly wet McAvoy and moustache-twirling Giamatti. Engaging performers all, but the movies superficial flummery is slightly exasperating when the true-life events would have provided an even richer palette of ideas. Trevor Johnston]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[On a South Carolina beach, a reticent G.I. Joe (Tatum) on temporary leave meets a rich girl (Seyfried), and the duo instantly ignites sparksNicholas Sparks, that is. Another achingly earnest adaptation from one of the chick-lit superstars formulaic weepies (The Notebook, A Walk to Remember), Chocolat director Lasse Hallströms tastefully old-fashioned melodrama has exactly one objective: yanking gallons of cathartic tears out of your face by any means necessary. After several heart-swelling weeks togetherwith a turgidly shot make-out session in the rain forever binding our young lovebirdsthe two vow to reunite after the soldiers tour of duty ends, leaving the art of letter writing to stoke their flames of passion. As they barely know each other (meaning ditto for us), however, insincere proclamations about their skin-deep chemistry, as read in voiceover, probably arent enough to lube the eyes. Which doesnt mean Dear John is without a few wet-duct tricks up its sleeve: Theres more autism, cancer, 9/11 shocks and bittersweet heartbreak here than you can shake a hankie at. Sometimes the leads pull off genuine tenderness, and other times their gauzily written caricatures cant elevate such overwrought housewife bait, but chances are, given its literary pedigree, most viewers are preordained to love or loathe it.

      <review><![CDATA[Like any given episode of Family Guy, this adaptation of CD Paynes novel is such a relentlessly cruel piece of work that you cant help but laugh heartily at it. The insatiable libido of horndog high-schooler Nick Twisp (Cera) is the impetus for various scattershot misadventures that revolve around his desperate attempts to bed the Belmondo-loving Sheeni Saunders (Doubleday). Shes a sharp-tongued inspiration in Nicks otherwise soul-deadening existence, constantly prodding him to come out of his shell and let his freak flag fly. And so it does, when Nick creates François Dillinger (also Cera), a more suavely confident and seemingly corporeal alter ego who wreaks havoc wherever he goes.As this snake-tongued doppel-gänger, Cera sports a pencil-thin moustache, lasciviously brandishes a cigarette and embodies a perfect parody of adolescent wish-fulfilment. Hes also a profane little f**ker: In Youth in Revolts funniest scene  set in that comic goldmine, an all-girl boarding school  the two Ceras share screen space, as François coaches Nick on the proper, most vulgar ways to seduce Sheeni. Its a kick to see Cera cut loose from his patented befuddled-nerd routine, even if the films caricatured performances and fish-in-a-barrel scorn are sure to be monotonous for some.

      <review><![CDATA[A ray of sunshine onscreen, Drew Barrymore isnt going to suddenly make a grungy roller-derby movie. (Even the naughtier ex-Drew who once flashed David Letterman couldnt swing that.) So shes done something harder: made an intensely sweet roller-derby movie about letting your kids grow up happy. Whip It, Barrymores confident debut behind the camera, starts off in a desperate Texas nowheresville  an oven of blonde beauty pageants and crap jobs. Then, along with its teenage dreamer, the film sneaks off to an evocatively captured Austin and the world of cute but callous indie-rockers and snarly girls in kneepads. Finally, it ends with a kitchen reconciliation. (This is where Barrymore is most effective at conveying heartbreak.)Along that exuberant trajectory, Whip It rights a few wrongs. First, theres proof here that Junos Ellen Page is no mere flash in the pan. She uses her tiny frame to project vulnerability, coming alive as she flings herself into danger, shedding the starchy name Bliss Cavendar for the unlikely track moniker Babe Ruthless. In assembling her sassy sisterhood, Barrymore has also given the criminally underused Kristen Wiig her first proper role, as a maternal roller with no-bulls**t sympathies. (You wish the script hadnt fully sanded down the butch aspects of the derby scene, but apparently thats what subtext is for.)Most substantially, the film pits parental hopes against the private ambitions of youth, and somehow manages to take both sides. Marcia Gay Harden is the pictures treasure; watching her swell with concern at her daughters choices, you understand how hard it is to let go  even when kneepads are provided.

      <genre><![CDATA[Comedy]]></genre>
      <review><![CDATA[Up in the Air seeks comedy from two of Americas  indeed the Western worlds  most current fears: flying and redundancy. A tough ask, you might think, but director Jason Reitman offers an enjoyable balance of laughs and sorrows, pratfalls and body blows, even if this charming road movie (or should that be air movie?), adapted by Reitman and screenwriter Sheldon Turner from a 2001 novel by Walter Kirn, finally doesnt end up anywhere nearly as interesting or original as the enticing signposts suggest en route.  This is Reitmans third film after Thank You for Smoking and Juno, both of which were much less assured when it came to marrying social reality and laughs. George Clooney is Ryan Bingham, a bachelor and corporate lone gun who derives more pleasure from the 300-plus days a year he spends travelling around the country making people redundant than the 43 miserable ones he spends at home in a characterless apartment, out of step with the parochial glamour of his middle-rung executive lifestyle. Bingham, played winningly straight by Clooney, is a rare airborne species whose entire existence is threatened when his company hires tight-faced, thrusting young graduate Natalie Keener (a fun Anna Kendrick) to reassess the companys operations. This preppy pipsqueaks big  idea is to stop sending reps around the country and instead give clients employees their marching orders via a glorified version of Skype. Its an idea that falls sympathetically on credit-crunched managerial ears, although Binghams worried reaction reflects our conflicted response to the movie as a whole: half of him fears for those about to be sacked by satellite, while the other half fears losing a lifestyle that allows him to indulge in pleasures such as no-strings affairs with fellow travellers like Alex (Vera Farmiga), a good-time lady who implores him to think of me as yourself with a vagina. We might sympathise with those clearing their desks, but the threat of not being able to tag along with Clooney for the ride feels just as critical. Its an honest point: empathy only ever stretches so far.  For all its superficial topicality, Up in the Air mostly feels old-fashioned, nostalgic even, in its fond lament for a pre-9/11 world of travel. There are no security scares in this world. Its fetishisation of the rituals of flying is near-pornographic, with check-in girls substituting for bedfellows and frequent-flyer cards for sex toys. Binghams winning of millions of air miles come across as notches on his bed post. Hes the Warren Beatty of interstate business travel.  Its a pleasure to watch an adult American comedy that tries to deal with the real world, however much of a fantasy it carves from it. But the films later scenes as Bingham attends the wedding of a distant sister and has to face some ground-level realities about himself and his relationships are not as convincing or edifying as they should be and his sideline in motivational speaking never rings true as a symbol of his changing attitude to life. The films final announcement that even the most frequent flights of imagination have to touch down at some point is conventional and a little disappointing. But the journey is a riot while it lasts.

      <review><![CDATA[Thirty-five years after Network and All the Presidents Men,  in which journalists told uncomfortable truths and defended democracy, Green  Zone makes military personnel do the noble work which craven  reporters shirk. The only consolation is that the movie is inspired by a  work of journalism, Rajiv Chandrasekarans Imperial Life in the  Emerald City: Inside Iraqs Green Zone.  Set in Iraq in the  months following the 2003 invasion, the film reunites the director and  star of The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum,  Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon; this time, however, we already know the  details of the underhanded government action our hero confronts. Damon  plays an army warrant officer whose WMD sorties keep coming up empty;  unwilling to roll over, hes soon embroiled in a turf war between the  CIA and the Pentagon (personified by conscientious Brendan Gleeson and  oleaginous Greg Kinnear) while attempting to wrangle a Baathist general  (Igal Naor), a useful veteran (Said Faraj) and a useless embedded  reporter (Amy Ryan) against a backdrop of more-or-less real events.  Greengrasss  approach to real-life disaster is far more simplified and pumped up  here than it was in United 93 or Bloody Sunday, but  theres much to be said for his Bourne in Baghdad approach. The  action is robust, the politics simplified but strident, insisting that a  wilfully under-prepped war worked against both US and Iraqi interests. By  shifting focus from the naively doctrinaire civilians of  Chandrasekarans book to street-level soldiers questioning authority,  Greengrass concocts a formula with a fighting chance of dispelling the  Curse of the Hollywood Iraq Movie. If a picture as conventionally  accessible as Green Zone tanks, that campaign is surely lost. Ben Walters]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Desperation oozes from every frame of Cop Out, which front-loads its best jokean aerial pan from Manhattan to Kings County scored with the Beastie Boys 'No Sleep Till Brooklyn'then spends the rest of its running time endlessly spinning its wheels. Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan are partners in law out to recover a stolen baseball card from some badass Hispanic gangsters. How we arrive at that golden nugget of a plot complication is something for the Robert McKees of the world to illuminate; for the rest of us, this is some soul-sapping dada with which director Kevin Smith is staining his already-dubious résumé. The actors constantly indulge in unfocused improv: Morgan is given what feels like a full reel to unleash an unfunny succession of re-created film scenes, each followed by a reaction shot of Willis telling us what said scene is supposed to be (Heat!; The Color Purple!). The camera later fleetingly catches game supporting actor Kevin Pollak doing a spot-on De Niro impersonation, and its like seeing the difference between mastery and cacophony. Nearly all the jokes are spewed as if they were a barrage of bullets. Thats fitting, since this purported comedy is also senselessly violent: Guns are fired with reckless abandon. Blood is carelessly spilled. And amid all the carnage, were supposed to give a damn about whether Morgans wife is cheating on him and if Willis can give his daughter a dream wedding on a cops salary. Then theres the Seann William Scott stoner scenes, but, really, why prolong the torment? Keith Uhlich]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[For the past year, 3D has been a guarantee of box-office gold, as proven by the runaway success of Avatar. But now, for the first time, a film arrives for which the 3D element may prove to be a commercial hindrance. Its not only that Clash of the Titans will compete with Alice in Wonderland, How to Train Your Dragon and Avatar for the nations 3D screens. More critically than that, the film's conversion to 3D (a decision taken late in the filmmaking process) has rendered this campy, unashamedly old-school but still highly enjoyable blockbuster rather painful to watch.  In story terms, Clash of the Titans doesn't stray too far from the beloved 1981 Ray Harryhausen classic which spawned it. The setting is mythical Ancient Greece  an age of Gods, monsters and muscular men in little chainmail skirts. Sam Worthington is Perseus, an orphaned demi-God drawn into the battle between man and the immortals when Hades (Ralph Fiennes), lord of the underworld, threatens to unleash his great sea-beast, the Kraken, on the city of Argos. Accompanied by a ragtag band of warriors, Perseus sets off to learn the secrets of the Kraken and end the reign of the Gods once and for all.  Theres no ignoring the fact that Clash of the Titans is a mess: the plot is episodic and rushed, the dialogue blunt and occasionally laughable, and there are far too many characters, few of whom leave much of an impression. Both Worthington and love interest Gemma Arterton look like theyre on a strenuous Aegean package holiday, but luckily theyre surrounded by the likes of Fiennes, Pete Postlethwaite and Liam Neeson as Zeus, whose commanding, armour-clad presence seems, at times, to be the only thing holding this crumbling edifice together.  Other notable names dont fare so well: Danny Huston gets a mighty fake beard but just one line as sea-God Poseidon, Mads Mikkelsen does little more than bare his teeth as burly swordsman Draco and, most egregiously, Jason Flemyng gets a terrific backstory and some superb melting-face makeup as ruined ruler Calibos  and that's it. It's is a recurring problem throughout the film: with dialogue and character motivation cut back to the bare minimum, theres no way for anyone to express themselves except through action.  But, luckily, this is where Clash of the Titans succeeds. Whatever the flaws in the script, theres no faulting director Louis Leterriers visual ambition: this is a film of mighty vistas, beautifully designed beasts and intense, well-structured combat sequences, all rendered in eye-popping, though still rather fake-looking, CGI. Taking the lessons of The Lord of the Rings to heart, Leterrier goes all-out for excess: his computer-generated camera soars above sprawling cities, endless deserts and blasted underworld hellscapes, lending the film a dizzying, epic scale.  A shame, then, that the addition of 3D has rendered much of this grandeur all but unwatchable, blurring the image to a headache-inducing degree and adding absolutely nothing to a film which was obviously shot in two dimensions and should have stayed that way. As an experiment in high-Hollywood style over substance, Clash of the Titans is a very entertaining ride. But take our advice: sidestep the 3D and see it the old fashioned way.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[The stylish opening  a camera track through an ashen forest  attests to the talents of ace cinematographer Don Burgess. His moody and immersive visuals (most memorably a shoot-out filmed, Children of Men-style, in an illusory single take) lend weight to this otherwise routine post-apocalyptic tale set in a future America of 2043.  A mean motherfuckin servant of God (Denzel Washington) shepherds a mysterious book to some locale way out west. After a stopover in a decrepit outpost, the holy warrior attracts the attention of a snake-tongued saloon owner (Gary Oldman) who wants to use the book for his own purposes. Cue guns n ammo showdowns, not to mention much product placement the J Crew and Motorola folk bedevil us even in the end-times.  Thank the pallid green heavens for Jennifer Beals (long ago in Flashdance) who is ravishing as a sightless kept woman acting as the storys oracle. She wanders the halls of her makeshift prison like a goddess deprived of power. For a few brief moments, the film becomes something close to Greek mythology, as opposed to weak graphic-novel imitation. Keith UhlichSee latest film reviews.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Apologies to all of you whove been looking forward to Lewis Carroll getting the Tim Burton treatment. For this loose amalga-daptation of both Alices Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, Burton is in dispassionate, for-hire mode, which means hes more concerned with computer-generated eyesores than with the character, Alice Kingsley (Wasikowska), whose subconscious theyre meant to represent. Alice is no longer a girl, but a woman in her late teens facing an arranged marriage to a snooty stick-in-the-mud. While mulling her situation, our heroine is drawn back to Wonderland by the White Rabbit. Its there that a prophecy is unveiled (damn prophecies!) saying Alice will slay the monstrous Jabberwock, whos been terrorizing the land at the behest of the literally big-headed Red Queen (Carter). Save the terrific Sweeney Todd, Burton hasnt convincingly visualized a dreamworld since his mid-90s heyday. The grounding psychology of his fantastical characterslike his two Eds, Wood and Scissorhandshas eluded him since hes gone green screen. Its especially damaging in this case, since the Alice novels are all about a girls inner life made animate. Wasikowska certainly looks the part, but we never get the sense that this placeor playth, as Johnny Depps lisping, unmemorable Mad Hatter might sayand its populace spring from her psyche. Shes basically lost on a Burtons Greatest Hits ride at Disney World, where even an ostensibly inventive character like the films toothy, dematerializing Cheshire Cat feels like a weightless derivative of the directors more tangible past creations. And unlike Carrolls perversely idealized protagonist, Burtons Alice is just another anachronistic feminist tearing down Victorian patriarchal norms. Even her[shudder]Avril Lavigneblared theme song is a skin-deep grrrl-power accessory. Keith Uhlich See latest film reviews.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Towards the end of the Coen brothers The Big Lebowski, a black-clad German complains that a situation isnt fair. Fair? splutters Walter Sobchak (John Goodman). Whos the f**king nihilist around here?! Life isnt fair for the lead of the Coens latest, A Serious Man, either. Larry Gopnik (Stuhlbarg), a mild-mannered mathematics professor in 1967 suburban Jewish Minnesota, is struggling with a crumbling marriage, alienated kids, a burdensome brother, malicious professional rumours, a siren neighbour and incessant calls from a mail-order record company. Unlike the nihilists, however, Larry has faith: he is a conscientious Jew and tries to be a serious man. So, to quote a Jefferson Airplane song from the films soundtrack, when the truth is found to be lies and all the hope within you dies Then what?Glanced at in many of the Coens earlier films, Jewishness is front and centre here, from the shtetl-set, Yiddish-speaking prologue to the hermetically Jewish community in which Larry lives. Drawing on the actual milieu of their own adolescence, the filmmakers  past masters of outré production design and sardonic genre subversion  play things relatively straight to tell a story that, for all its plentiful absurdities, is sincerely engaged with the challenge of unjust suffering. Bewildered, desperate, nose twitching in perplexity, Stuhlbargs Larry has been compared to Job; understandably, given his host of burdens and the settings Old Testament overtones. Yet Larry is perhaps closer to Kafkas Josef K, another put-upon character who suffers an unwarranted ordeal without quite being heroic.The Coens nod at familiar stylistic tropes  florid swearing, sexual euphemism, crusty, aged characters  but the films potency is rooted in quiet precision and detailed realisation. Roger Deakins typically polished photography gives an oppressively hard edge to Midwestern suburbia while the sound design is a wondrous mélange of soup-slurping, hacking coughs, gastric juices and ominous clanging. Stuhlbarg, a Tony-winning stage actor, leads a largely unknown but impeccable cast that also includes Sari Lennick as Larrys no-nonsense wife, Fred Melamed as her smug, unctuous lover and Richard Kind as Larrys sad-sack brother, forever draining a cyst on his neck.Established religion offers Larry little consolation, but the idea of faith  or at least good living  that emerges from his struggle matches the sensibility the Coens have unobtrusively espoused throughout their work: reject worldly status, bear trials with humility, find joy in fellow-feeling. Bad things happen to good people. To acknowledge  even, as storytellers, to embrace  this fact is not to indulge in nihilism, but to make more urgent the social task that might mitigate its effects. Youd better find somebody to love. Ben WaltersSee latest film reviews.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Following a disastrous incursion into bubblegum high-school romance territory (I Love You, Beth Cooper), Chris Columbus, director of the first two Harry Potters, returns to his comfort zone for this episodic and mirthless fantasy saga based on the first of a series of fantasy books by US writer Rick Riordan. Mulching together the angsty teen intrigue of Harry Potter and the frigid-and-proud flagwaving of Twilight, the film sees Zac Efron lookalike Logan Lerman (Gamer) playing an underachiever who turns out to be a sword-swinging demigod when he discovers his birth was the result of the god Poseidon (Kevin McKidd) having a quick fling with dowdy New York housewife Catherine Keener. When his mother is kidnapped by Hades (Steve Coogan in full Saxondale mode) as a bargaining chip for Zeuss lost lightning bolt, Percy is charged with finding a number of trinkets dotted across North America in order to avert a crisis on Mount Olympus (located just above the New York cloud cover, who knew?) and save mom from eternal damnation.  That Percy risks life and limb to preserve the family unit is typical Columbus, and the film works best when playing on the idea that no amount of bravado is enough to mask our desire for parental love. Yet its not enough to compensate for the computer-game-style plotting, which is largely based on us picking up narrative nuggets that mechanically slot into place later on. Problematic, too, is the product placement: witness the scene in which Percy battles Medusa (Uma Thurman) and avoids her deathly gaze by craftily using the shiny back of his iPod as a mirror.

      <review><![CDATA[Although far better than its troubled history lead one to fear, this gory, gothic take on the classic lycanthropic love story has had its romantic heart ripped out. Returning to his estranged fathers crumbling pile in 1891  to investigate his brothers disappearance  actor Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) falls for his dead siblings mourning fiancée, Gwen (Emily Blunt). But before this spark of love can ignite, Lawrence is bitten by the lunar-tic creature the locals fear, and must confront the beast buried within himself. With its mist-shrouded sets, gruesome slaughter and copious CGI, this is a surprisingly respectful updating of the 1941 Universal original. Thanks to Rick Bakers make-up effects, Del Toros transformations from handsome lover to hairy, howling beast are frighteningly convincing; Anthony Hopkins is restrained as his emotionally detached father; and a cruelly underused Blunt is all-a-quiver as the beautiful, bereaved Gwen. Ultimately, though, neither Joe Johnstons efficient direction nor Danny Elfmans hard-working score can lift the familiar storyline out of the ordinary. Nigel Floyd]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Anyone heading to the cinema this February 14 will find themselves conspicuously catered for by this romantic comedy from veteran Garry Marshall (Pretty Woman, Beaches). Throwing out a net to everyone from back-row teenage saliva-swappers to seasoned seniors, the film feels like it has been coldly calculated to hoover up demographics. How? Marshall gives his rom-com the Robert Altman Short Cuts treatment: an enormous megawatt ensemble cast appear in a dozen or so interlocking lurve stories that play out on Valentines Day in Los Angeles. Its supremely efficient and utterly ruthless.There are 19 all-star names above the title (in alphabetical order, naturally) but the lead belongs to Ashton Kutcher. A nice-guy florist, he proposes to his work-addict girlfriend (Jessica Alba), but is obviously much better suited to his teacher best friend (Jennifer Garner). Jessica Biel (is it me, or are the Jessicas interchangeable?) plays a neurotically single sports publicist. Anne Hathaway, an office temp who moonlights as a phone sex operator (little nod to Short Cuts there), hasnt told her new boyfriend about the sideline. Shirley MacLaine, happily married for 50 years, is keeping an old secret from her husband. In what reeks of final-draft add-on, country star Taylor Swift and Taylor Lautner from The Twilight Saga pair up as school sweethearts: no actual storyline here, but they tick the pre-teen box big time.  These are sassily-scripted but glossy, vacuous fantasies  with the exception of Julia Robertss army captain, whos on short leave from Iraq and meets a guy (Bradley Cooper) on a plane: after some sparky but non-committal flight banter they go their separate ways and both their tales resolve with unexpectedly lovely flourishes. Their stories make the rest of the film look like its got a cold, shiny cash register right where its heart should be. Cath Clarke]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Jeff Bridges, for all his glorious achievements, still hasnt been celebrated enough. A technical actor (remember Starman?) who manages to make every gesture a perfect one, hes been paired with difficult material over a meandering career and always succeeded. So if this better-than-average country-singer tale does the trick come Oscar time, heres someone who wont complain. Bad Blake, much like Bridgess immortal Dude, is belly-acting: gutsy and, well, big-gutted. The number of times Blake is seen emerging from a pickup truck with his belt unfastened is almost a running joke. Rambling through a series of Texas bars and vomiting behind them, Blake is haunted by a musical protégé whos become a huge star (Farrell). His own glory days are long behind him.  Crazy Heart pairs this fascinating private strummer with a curious journalist (Gyllenhaal), who soon shares with him a bed and the affections of her daddyless young son. For the movies first hour, you perk up at the vibrations of sympathetic emotions, pitched at a quiet frequency not heard since Tender Mercies. (The appearance of Robert Duvall is a bonus.) Upsettingly, though, someones decided that such intimate moments are not enough for a night of entertainment, so a manufactured kid-in-jeopardy climax and Blakes rehab stint blow the mood. Until then, this is great American acting. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Not a great deal happens in Bright Star, Jane Campions breezy and beautiful film about the nineteenth-century British poet John Keats (played by Ben Whishaw). The New Zealand directors film is light in the most attractive and dreamy of ways: it floats on its own, intimately explored love story and refuses to be weighed down by either period fixtures and fittings or the later reputation of Keats, whose final years and stalling romance with his neighbour Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish) Campion handles with a smartness and sensitivity that feel teasingly throwaway.Thats not to say theres anything slapdash about Campions story of how Keats moved in next door to the fatherless Brawne family and fell in love with slightly younger Fanny, tentatively courting her and writing her wonderfully honest letters but fatally kept at a distance by poverty and illness. In fact, for this critic, its the exquisite detail of the whole affair, coupled with the aerating winds of modernity that blow gently through the film, rather than the emotional pull of the doomed love affair at its heart, that are the films real success. (Others, I must say, differ on this point, judging by the sobs and sniffles to my left and right at the London Film Festival screening of the film.) A combination of unstuffy dialogue, wise casting, unselfconscious performances and sensuous but never pretty photography makes Campions version of the nineteenth century feel current but not anachronistic.Campion came to Keatss story, which she shot in Britain last year, after a four-year sabbatical from filmmaking  and it shows, especially following the dark, oppressive atmosphere of In the Cut, one of her least successful films. Her telling of this biographical tale, inspired by Andrew Motions biography, feels as if its told by someone with much knowledge but little weight on their shoulders. Its a feeling one gets from the performances too, especially from Cornish and Whishaw, who both, at times, threaten to float off on a cloud of their characters distraction. Its down to the side players, especially an earthy Kerry Fox as Fannys mother and a boisterous Paul Schneider as Keatss friend and protector Charles Brown, to give the film some vim away from the fog of love. Whishaw, with his troubled air and vulnerable features, is perhaps better as a Romantic lead than a romantic one, and if the film has one crucial failing, its that theres a crucial spark missing between Whishaw and Cornish. Campion treats Keatss talent as a given and not a cue for creaky explorations of inspiration and artistic otherness. She weaves his poetry into the drama, calling for it to be spoken naturally and not at all awkwardly by her characters. Its not easy to follow verse this way, but it certainly inspires the viewer to head straight from the cinema to the bookshop. Dave CalhounSee latest film reviews.]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Best wipe 8 1/2 from your mind, or at least delay seeing Fellinis loopy masterpiece, if youre going to enjoy this angsty romp through the directors 1963 film about a fictional Italian filmmaker, Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis), who loses his mojo and might be about to lose his marbles and his marriage.Surprisingly, though, theres lots in this musical version, itself an adaptation of a 1980s Broadway show, that relates to the sombre heart of Fellinis original. We still get Guidos formative childhood memory of watching a prostitute perform on the beach (although this time it is Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas brilliantly belting out the films foot-tapping anthem Be Italian). We also get the lingering ghost of his mother (Sophia Loren!), the pain of his adultery and the madness of his creative impasse. Also, Fellinis meshing of dream and reality is oddly suited to the unreal tendencies of a musical, although its anybodys guess what the director would have made of Penélope Cruz throwing herself around in stockings and suspenders and upping the sex factor beyond anything Claudia Cardinale offered in the original.The biggest difference, though, is that almost 50 years later, director Rob Marshall (Chicago) is able to play the story of 8 1/2 as a nostalgia piece. He fetishises the look and feel of 1960s Italy and especially Rome so that the films mood of artistic melancholia is expressed on a canvas that comes dangerously close to looking like an ad for Italian coffee. Marshall and his writers, including the late Anthony Minghella, also stress the humour of Guidos philandering, often preferring that his inner turmoil goes no further than chain-smoking. To give Day-Lewis his due, the actor grounds the films sillier tendencies in a charming performance of mercurial despair. Hes well supported by Marion Cotillard, who conveys the sadness of being  Guidos wife, although both Nicole Kidman as his leading lady and Kate Hudson as an admiring journalist are little more than window-dressing.

      <review><![CDATA[What am I now? asks the extraordinary Saoirse Ronan, her eyes welling. The dead girl? The lost girl? The missing girl? Im nothing. Whatever the flaws of this less-than-wondrous version of The Lovely Bones (and there are several), theyre not of this poised actor, as intuitive a teen talent as Haley Joel Osment. The sky around her just swirls a little too vigorously; the story, brought to screen in a showy CGI manner, takes place in a strange first-person purgatory out of which teenage Suzie Salmon, murdered by a serial killer, narrates her story. Alice Sebolds 2002 novel was heartrendinga potent mixture of grief, resignation and the resiliency of memory. Such spells can sometimes make it to the screen intact. (Think of Sofia Coppolas The Virgin Suicides.)  The filmmaker we get, though, is Peter Jackson, and while hobbits and giant apes are temporarily exorcised from his system, he hasnt quite recaptured the psychological intimacy of 1994s Heavenly Creatures. This new movies 70s-era clothes and cars are detractingly vivid; scenes often feel like the hyperreal dream sequences of Brian De Palmas Carrie. The Lovely Bones is a supernatural tale too, and Jackson, scripting with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, has amped up the suspense elements at the expense of delicate mood: An unrecognizable Stanley Tucci pursues Suzies younger sister in a Hitchcockian housebound chase that thrills to no purpose. There wont be any justice here, and you cant help but think a heroically committed Mark Wahlberg (less ruined than the books dad) or a sassy Susan Sarandon (as the boozy grandma) are somehow beside the point. Its a movie that tips toward overkilleven Ronans voice is amplified into a weird whisper. More quiet would have helped. Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[A companion piece to Fernando Meirelles souped-up (and lapped-up) 2002 urban crime drama, City of God, Paulo Morellis City of Men replaces that films hypnotic sadokineticism with something equally, if more quietly, audacious. By accentuating the humour and humanity of people stuck in desperate circumstances instead of fetishising the violence that surrounds them, City of Men serves as a belated corrective to its predecessor.The follow-up concerns two young Rio favela dwellers, best friends Ace and Wallace (Silva and Cunha, both non-professional actors who also appeared in Meirelles film), coping with a drug-gang turf war that forces them to reconcile with the past and accept incipient adulthood. A rift develops between them when Wallace finds his long-absent father and Ace begins taking more comfort in the thug life than with his wife (Monteiro) and son. Meanwhile, the gang leaders (Haagensen and Eduardo BR Piranha) pursue what amounts to a deadly, futile game of king of the hill that produces no real victor. This wry reductionism gives City of Men a moral edge over the gunplay-besotted posturing of the previous film, despite the fact that Morelli occasionally succumbs to earnestness and sentimentality, and loses narrative focus in the final act.

      <review><![CDATA[Its quite likely that Staff Sergeant William James (Renner)the bomb-defusing expert at the center of the terrific Iraq War action film The Hurt Lockerwas named by screenwriter Mark Boal after a certain pragmatic 19th-century philosopher. On the cleverness-to-profundity scale, that falls somewhere between calling a desert-island survivalist Locke and christening a living stuffed tiger Hobbes. But James is more than his moniker, not so much larger-than-life as eternally engaged, gruntlike, with the one thing he does better than anyone else.  Renner, whose half-muscled pudginess calls to mind Fassbinder circa Fox and His Friends, gets inside Jamess skin in ways that a more seasoned celebrity could not. Its a role that might have easily devolved into one-note paeans to badassery, especially in concert with an episodic story structure that constantly toggles between machismo-laden home-base drama and perilously prolonged fieldwork. Yet in this actors hands, the character comes off with a credible working-class clarityhes less concerned with performing kiss-off heroics than with doing a good job and pissing the night away.  The James-free prologue, which features the first of two kill-em-off star cameos, seemingly sets the stakes high. But director Kathryn Bigelow, doing her run-n-gun best, doesnt mine traditional suspense so much as impart a queasy feeling of monotony. The Hurt Locker is all about existing in an often repetitious moment. Superimposed titles count down the days left in James and his squads rotation, though theres little sense of movement toward an ultimate endpoint. As the opening Chris Hedges quote (War is a drug) suggests, there are no accomplishments in this line of work, only an unending round of highs, lows and in-betweens. Keith Uhlich]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[During the Bush era, it was pretty hard to make a military comedy. The armed forces tended to be presented as either noble or amoral but seldom as clowns. The Men Who Stare at Goats is refreshing, then, for its knockabout approach to martial matters; its problems lie with its lackadaisical approach to narrative and structure.  The film is a dramatised version of Jon Ronsons non-fiction book about a small pocket of the US Army given licence to experiment with non-violent and paranormal approaches to conflict resolution. American journalist Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) arrives in Kuwait in 2003 with a broken heart and something to prove. Stumbling upon Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), whom he recognises as having been involved in the so-called First Earth Battalion, he finds himself on what could well be a wild goose- (or goat-) chase inside post-Saddam Iraq. Meanwhile, he fills us in on the battalions history, from its instigation by Nam vet-turned-hippy visionary Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) to its undoing by bitter psy-op Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey).  Theres plenty to enjoy in the films outré set-pieces, insouciant tone and playful performances: Clooney keeps us guessing about Cassadys abilities (and sanity) and Bridges gets to deliver lines like: Im your commanding officer and Im ordering you to let out the dance! Theres also a running joke about Jedi warriors that bounces nicely off McGregors Star Wars pedigree. But the film hedges its claims to veracity (more of this is true than you would believe, indeed) and fails to make its characters or narrative dramatically compelling. The result feels less like a transcendental breakthrough than a bit of conjuring misdirection. Fun trick, though. Ben Walters]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Once upon a time, a nebbishy New Yorker could fall for a willowy shiksa goddess and you could call it Annie Hall. No longer. Now, the whole movies got to be set in Los Angeles (not just one Christmas sequence), our love object barely gets a single la-di-da, and forget about naming the film after her. Weve got inner male pain to address. That shift, though, is precisely what makes Greenberg, Noah Baumbachs latest comedy-drama, so car-crash-arresting and emblematic of Gen X self-absorption. Baumbach, an expert at skewering urbane pretensions ('The Squid and the Whale'), has conceived a remarkably sour character in Ben Stillers furious letter writer and fortyish layabout, Roger Greenberg. Once a college-rock musician, he scotched his bands momentum in a fit of principle and now suffers the consequences: occasional work at carpentry and pride-swallowing in the home of his much wealthier brother. A ratty Steve Winwood T-shirt speaks volumes, as does a shelf of meds and a constant stream of bile directed at partygoing kids who scare him with their potential. Rogers just not fun to be around. Baumbachs idea here is to find an expiration date on boyishnessits tempting to compare Greenberg to the more-trenchant 'The Anniversary Party' (2001), also a shrewd examination of the limits of youthful decadence (and partly created by the filmmakers wife, Jennifer Jason Leigh, as is this). This movie corrects its wobbly, negative spiral with the romantic development of Florence (Gerwig, spacey as ever), a personal assistant to Rogers sib and perhaps a salvation. Scratch that perhaps: Greenberg only slightly misses the top flight by settling for too weak a foil. (The better option, Rhys Ifanss bruised bandmate, is right there.) But when Stiller indulges in moments of unfulfilled rage, this has real desperation. Joshua Rothkopf ]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Photo: Twentieth Century Fox There are those of us who can watch brainy Tina Fey bobble around 30 Rock for hours, and drink up her every self-deprecating zinger like freshly brewed espresso. (As for the others who dont get herwe understand Sarah Palin has a new show.) Still, theres no reason why Fey, so dynamic on the small screen, has to get Anistoned out of a proper Hollywood crossover. Baby Mama (2008) was cringingly mediocre; indeed, one has to cast back to 2004s tangy, Fey-scripted Mean Girls to get a reasonable glimmer of her talent. Even then, we were still watching Lindsay Lohan.  Date Night isnt going to alter this conundrumit makes you laugh in fits and starts, but more often it feels toothless and exhausted, the kind of project that exists to give Ray Liotta work. (The generic script is by Shrek-sequel scribe Josh Klausner.)  Fey is almost perfectly paired with Steve Carell as bored, married New Jerseyites Claire and Phil: The way they trade quips and cast snide aspersions at strangers, the actors seem totally believable as intellectual mates and, more crucially, deeply in danger of losing intimacy. After stealing a reservation at a clichéd-snobby NYC eatery, the couple is mistaken for blackmailers and pursued by goons, North by Northweststyle, throughout the city.  You know where this is going; shouty misadventures in a slow-moving motorboat, a clamorous car chase and an exclusive sex club will surely move them out of the most excellent roommates category. When Mark Wahlberg shows up as a shirtless tech-heavy spyone who can also flirt in Hebrewhe almost constitutes a joke in himself. But cant there at least be faster fish for Fey and Carell to shoot in the barrel? Joshua Rothkopf]]></review>

      <review><![CDATA[Christopher Isherwoods seminal queer novel deserves a film adaptation that captures both its sense of place and its activist spirit. Cowriter-director Tom Ford settles for the glossy ephemera of a Vanity Fair cover spread. Both Isherwood and Ford follow Brit-expat college professor George (Firth, dully competent despite the film festival plaudits and Oscar buzz) through a single, sun-baked California day at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis. But only in the film is there a hoary motivating factora suicidal death wish stemming from Georges mournful pining for his dead lover Jim (Goode)meant to round off edges that should remain jagged. (The most frayed thing onscreen is, tellingly, an angora sweater.) Fords biggest mistake is making George a martyrdom-ready symbol; too many movies subscribe to the regressive notion that queers are unassailable victims of fate and circumstance. One of the most revealing amendments here involves a flashback in which George is informed of Jims death and is refused an invite to the funeral. Theres no such melodramatic manipulation in Isherwoods tome, where George is invited to the funeral and refuses out of a fascinatingly contradictory mix of pride, prejudice and anguish. It deepens his humanity rather than making him allegorically alien. Isherwood set out to normalize his gay protagonists experience, showing the many different poses he assumed within a seemingly routine day (in that context, masturbation was as mundane yet significant an occurrence as driving on the freeway). Ford privileges sexual preference over all else. Its the defining trait of his Georgea Camille-esque affliction signaled by a portentous cough and overcome in a sacrificial ending that turns Isherwoods beautifully enigmatic final passages into a poisonous, irony-laced tear-jerk.

      <review><![CDATA[Photo: Cathay-Keris Films and InnoForm MediaIts surely no coincidence that when Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), the comic-book-reading New York teenager who decides to buy a coloured wetsuit and become the superhero of the title, winds up in hospital after his first outing as a vigilante, he reads Watchmen. Like that story, the series by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr, on which Kick-Ass is based is a comic about comics, presuming a substantial knowledge of the icons and conventions of the superhero genre. Its an index of how successfully that genre has established itself in the Hollywood mainstream over the past decade that such postmodern, self-referential fare is now deemed apt fodder for major studio releases.  Puzzled that no one has ever tried to put comic-book theory into practice, Dave hits the streets in the name of righteousness, overcoming early setbacks to achieve hero status with a little help from MySpace and YouTube. He also attracts the attention of father-and-daughter vigilante team Big Daddy and Hit Girl (Nicolas Cage and Chloë Moretz) and arouses the enmity of crime lord Frank DAmico (Mark Strong), whose son (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) sees a chance to dabble in the hero game himself.  Director Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Stardust) directs with efficiency and a good sense of action while Johnson puts in an engaging turn that maintains sympathy and helps paper over some of the plots more jerky, episodic aspects. Wearing its sources on its Spandex sleeve, Kick-Ass fairly bulges with references to other comic-book movies, especially the Spider-Man and Batman franchises; Cages stilted delivery as the Dark Knightish Daddy is a nice touch. Theres some intriguing play around ideas of closetedness  a perennial concern of the genre  with Daves secret life leading classmates to presume hes gay. Other conventions are touched upon but left unexplored: while it is constructed around three father-child pairings, for instance, the film leaves Daves single dad a cipher.  The bond between pre-teen Hit Girl and her Big Daddy, meanwhile, is as intense as it is outrageously violent, rooted in such affectionate larks as his shooting her at close range to familiarise her with the use of bullet-proof vests. The duo are responsible for many of the pictures numerous fatalities, shown in more detail and with more gusto than in most superhero films (or most 15-rated films, for that matter). The sight of Hit Girl slicing and dicing half a dozen thugs to the accompaniment of the Banana Splits theme tune locates Kick-Ass in the post-Tarantino landscape of hyperfictional ultraviolence. Any gestures at a version of realism or the pathos that might result from someone actually trying to be a superhero are lost in the wash. Ben Walters]]></review>
