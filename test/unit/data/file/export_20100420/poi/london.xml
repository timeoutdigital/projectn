        <description><![CDATA[Behind a very discreet entrance on Endell Street, almost opposite The Hospital members club, jazz joint Octave played its last 7th augmented flat 9th chord in July last year, and Circus has now moved in. 

It has no connection to another bar-restaurant called Circus, now closed, that was fashionable in Soho during the noughties, though.

Lets get this straight: its not a circus. It should, instead, be called Cabaret, as theres a certain amount of that. 

Every night, a long banquet table doubles up as a catwalk and stage for fire-eaters, busty burlesque performers and dancers who dangle from the ceiling and do all manner of cunning stunts in a hoop. 

If that doesnt make your retinas wince then the gleaming white floors and walls will. The bar and dining areas are a little spartan and stark but you can sit soft in a lounge area and the loos are a bit fancy too. The service is spot-on. 

The drinks list, created by a consultancy called Worldwide Cocktail Club, was being dispensed by Dick Bradsell on our visits. There is an emphasis on classic cocktails delivered with a twist; theres no questioning their quality. 

We strayed off-piste with a request for hot toddy and, made with Talisker and cloves: it was a soothing sniffle snuffler. 

The food is high-end (ie pricey) American-accented with a Deep South twang - seafood jambalaya, spiced pork belly, slow-cooked beef short ribs and beef and black bean empanadas. 

With a starter and main, youre looking at 20-25 and then some. 

As well as the cabaret turns, it gets clubby at the weekends with regular DJs and even some dancing on the tables. 

Among all the guys and girls in glamorous get-up, at the weekends theres a certain amount of out-of-town folk going up west. ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[The new owners of the club formerly known as Home have turned it into the altogether more intellectual Book Club. 

It dwells in the Ditch at the Liverpool Street end of Leonard Street.

Hailing itself as a more cerebral sipping spot for the creative citizens of Shoreditch, its a lovely-looking, open and airy addition to an area that tends to lean towards darker, dingier drinking establishments. 

It comes courtesy of the folk behind the Queen of Hoxton and is looking to draw a thinking drinking crowd with a mix of cultural events, free wi-fi, meeting rooms and lots of comfy seats to get a good book on the go. 

The gigantic ground floor, padded out in exposed brickwork and white tiles with mosaics and a scattering of 1960s furniture, plays host to an open-plan kitchen, a bar and a side-shrine to ping-pong. 

Downstairs, theres a pool table, DJ booth and a bar. Smiley and switched-on staff throughout. 

Wine is served by the carafe, theres Tiger beer on draught and the cocktail list conjures up the usual classics as well as some locally themed libations including The Shoreditch Twat (Cazadores Reposado tequila, Jagermeister, vermouth, egg and vanilla sugar). 

Theres plenty of coffees and teas too, and the food  is served all day. 

It bigs up the breakfast with a house recipe of muesli and granola; French toast, kippers and a full English. Lunch leans towards excellent wraps, smoked haddock and poached eggs, seared tuna and dishes of the day. Puddings and cakes also give you the glad-eye.
 
Book Clubs entertainment calendar is crammed with plenty of chin-scratching, cultured carry-on including dance classes, art workshops, live hip hop and jazz, mock lectures and plenty of plain and simple partying. Check out the website to find out whats going down.

        <description><![CDATA[This new bar takes up residence in the basement beneath Mark Hixs eponymous new restaurant, located at the less smutty end of Sohos Brewer Street.  

It may be overshadowed by the much-lauded restaurant above it, but it's a destination bar in its own right  a sort-of subterranean speakeasy without the smugness. Theres a made-in-Manhattan feel, with a low zinc bar, tin panels on the ceiling and comfy Chesterfields slouched next to funky 1970s fixtures, a bar billiards table and retro rugs. Despite the dearth of natural light, its neither dark nor dingy, while the service is flawless throughout  beginning with a glass of water and bowl of Twiglets served before the drinks menu has even be touched. 

Hix has assembled an impressive, all-star dream-drinks-making team to boss the Boston shakers, led by Nick Strangeway, formerly of Hawksmoor and lauded as one of Londons leading barmeisters. Hes brought his stunning, quintessentially British and highly unusual historical cocktail list that, like the food menu, celebrates the seasons with its ingredients. The bar steeps fruits and herbs in spirits, experiments with its own infusions and serves them up in gorgeous glassware. 

While the 150-strong wine list might be expected in a restaurant bar, the enlightened beer menu is less so  rare is a top-end drinking venue that hails the ale. But here, with Hixs very own porter, pale ales, bitters, fruit beers and stouts all served in gleaming tankards, beer is celebrated in style. 

You have to order some food, as its part of the licence requirement. The entire  la carte restaurant menu can be had here alongside some lovely bar snacks such as pork crackling, sloe gin jelly, oysters and quails egg shooters.

The regulars are a mix of postprandial punters that have drifted down from upstairs and Soho workers (though not the ones paid by the hour).]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[This well-groomed Mayfair local is always near the top of 'London' and 'pub' search results, which may have something to do with its three owners  film director Guy Ritchie and the two men behind Mahiki - Nick House and Piers Adam. Then again, it may be because the Material Girl herself used to have an interest in it. But things have very publicly moved on since then. 

Despite the undue tabloid frenzy of interest this pub attracts, its not the blood-splattered tanking house that the redtops, and indeed the disgruntled neighbours, would have you believe. Well, at least not on our visits. 

There were no punch-ups with paparazzi, no noisy neer-do-wells of noble descent or half-cut cognoscenti. Perhaps Mayfairs idea of mischief-making is a little milder than most? Or perhaps the tabloid tales have been improved with the telling? It is, in reality, a classic, well-groomed pub with food that rivals restaurants in terms of price and approach. 

The tired 'function room' carpet that once distinguished the dining area from the drinking area from the pub has thankfully been ripped out as part of an discreet and tasteful improvement.

But, amid dark wood paneling, thickset tables and grandiose framed portraits, the distinction between drinking and dining remains with a cosy, candlelit restaurant area set back from the main bar where proper pub status has been preserved.

The food is fine yet not without fault and, it must be said, sold at a fair whack. The mushroom risotto we tried was bordered on stodgy, and the bangers &amp; mash impressed as much as bangers &amp; mash can. The waitress enitrely forgot about  our order of calf's liver. However when it did arrive, shortly after a profuse apology, it was superb. 

To drink, the pub could do with supporting the weighty list of wines with a broader range of beers. While Deuchars is a decent drop, Bombardier and Spitfire tread in the same ale territory. 

As for the slebs  notwithstanding the bloke who, we think, may present football highlights on ITV now and again, the pub was completely clean of celebrities. It being Mayfair, it was stuffed with a slightly older suited, braced and shiny-booted brigade talking quietly in twos.

        <description><![CDATA[Not so much a bar as a reproduction of your granny's sitting room, Bourne &amp; Hollingsworth is not easy to find (walk down some steps at the junction of Percy and Rathbone Streets), but it warrants the effort - particularly on Tuesday nights, when good bands entertain cool, young boozers. For the rest of the week, it's hip pop, which sometimes triggers impromptu dancing - surprising, as the lounge is tiny. It all adds to the cosy feel of the place, as do the standard lamps, old fireplace and granny's flowery (but so chic) wallpaper. The range of cocktails is good, and prices even better (5-7), which - with the friendly atmos - make this a fine venue. ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Owned by the same concern as the feted Les Trois Garons restaurant around the corner, this famously louche cocktail lounge may have had some of its thunder stolen by neighbourhood newcomer, Beach Blanket Babylon. Tasteful, low-lit decadence is still the decor key, with distressed wooden armoires, hot-house plants, vintage palm-frond chandeliers, a stuffed hippo's head, man-sized Chinese urns, antlers made of red, mirrored mosaic, a giant disco ball and tea lights set on elegant, glass-topped tables establishing a unique, upmarket ambience. Chinese-print-covered menus list cocktails by genre (Hot Lover, Old Flame [house specialties], First Love [classic mixes], Sweeties) and average around 9, while a glass of champagne is 8, but watch out for the 12.5% service charge added to your bill. It may be slightly pretentious, but staff are helpful to the cocktail-confused and if you're out to impress, the place can hardly be bettered. ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[The house rules here include 'No name-dropping, no star fucking. No hooting, hollering, shouting or other loud behaviour'. This admirable restraint continues in the low-key speakeasy-style decor and in the lighting - so dim that you may have trouble reading the menu - but who cares, everyone looks fantastic. Milk &amp; Honey is a members-only bar that is also open to all comers at certain times, and it's worth reserving a table here for the cocktails alone. Staff know their business, and drinks (a long list includes sours, swizzles, punches and fizzes) are first rate and not greedily priced (most cost 7.50). A grown-up place and all the better for it. Sister bars are the Player and the newly opened East Room. ]]></description>
