Tron: Legacy has been talked about for its music as much as the film. The music that Daft Punk recorded for this film has been leaking to the Internet for months. Daft Punk recorded the soundtrack with a 85-person orchestra. The film is just as magnificent as the soundtrack. Tron: Legacy was based in a digital world that looks like nothing we've seen on the silver screen before. It's an advanced technology 3D adventure that takes as its subject Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), who's the 27-year-old technology geek son of Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges). Sam Flynn is researching his father's disappearance and finds himself in the digital world of Tron, where his father has been living for 25 years. Together with Kevin's loyal friend Quorra (Olivia Wilde), father and son go on a quest of life and death in an visually mind-blowing cyber world that has become extremely dangerous.

The Tree is the latest project by young director Julie Bertucelli, whose movie Since Otar Left earned her wide acclaim.

When Dawn tells her little daughter Simone (Morgana Davies) that her father's spirit lives in the tree in their garden, she accepts this as a childish joke. This fantastical event, which no one believes at first, begins to receive acceptance among the family. After some time, the kids start speaking with their father, whom they believe lives in the tree, and Dawn follows their lead. In theatres January 21. Seda Pekçelen]]></review>

Needless to say, no one believes that the result will be love when Maggie and Jamie first meet. Yet as the relationship progresses, the love they experience starts to influence them in good ways. Love and Other Drugs was nominated for the 'Best Male Actor' (Jake Gyllenhaal), 'Best Female Actor' (Anne Hathaway) and 'Best Music' (A. R. Rahman) categories in this year's Golden Globe Awards.

Megamind is this month's animation film, which takes as its subject Megamind, the most intelligent and evil superhero ever. He's also the least successful. He tries every possible way to take over Metro City for years. Each attempt ends in failure, thanks to the unbeatable superhero who wears a cape and is known as Metro Man. Yet Metro Man's invincibility comes to an end someday, when he is killed while battling against an evil plan Megamind clumsily put into action. After that, life has no meaning for Megamind, as there's no point to being an evil superhero with no superhero. So Megamind sets out to create another superhero, named Titan, who's much bigger, better and stronger than Metro Man. Yet it doesn't take long for Titan to start thinking that it's much more fun being a bad guy than a good guy. Titan wants to destroy Earth, not conquer it. Now it is Megamind's job to defeat the evil monster he's created. In theatres January 14. Seda Pekçelen]]></review>
