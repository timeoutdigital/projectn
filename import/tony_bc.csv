Flaky empanadas are filled to bursting with leeks, peppers and a different meat or fish each day (the moist cod is an especially inspired choice). Spicy chorizo al jerez is tempered by a dry sherry saut&eacute;, while the gamba ajillo features shrimp flavorfully doused with garlic, olive oil and spicy red pepper. Flan, a light caramel custard, closes out the meal and is best paired with a slightly dry after-dinner sherry to undercut the dessert&#146;s sweetness.

Opening acts include the basics: Calamari alla griglia are grilled, tender tubes doused in lemon, olive oil, and more lemon, leaving a clean and sprightly finish; while the fagioli alla paolona is a pasta-less version of a Tuscan classic.

When the almost-twenty-four-hour haute diner opened over a decade ago, it was a perennial hot spot for model sightings and endlessly swarmed with sexed-up youngsters just on the verge of getting signed. But like any It-club, the luster starts to wear and hot young things begin to get replaced by cheesy bridge-and-tunnel renditions. The Coffee Shop still has its famous oh-so-comely wait staff and long lines for a table in either the large mirror-and-chrome front room or in the more private over-decorated World Room in back (complete with a roaring fireplace and a second bar). It also still has a very active people-watching scene at its snaking S-bar in the center. But for all its dark, broody fanfare, the menu remains just on the acceptable side of mediocre. The cuisine&#151;like last season's models&#151;is American with a Brazilian flair. But dishes that seem exotic in description, are rarely so inspired. The appetizer dumplings are more ravioli-like pockets stuffed with deliciously soft shrimp and caked in coconut. Unfortunately the dish gets drenched in a hopelessly watered-down mango puree. The hard-to-mess-up selections from the raw bar, like the oyster platter, and a range of basic salads are safer alternatives. The Brazilian-themed paella offers some more eclectic fish flavors, and entrees like the grilled salmon (alas, submerged in more mango) and a surprisingly generous rib-eye topped with a mushroom gravy are adequate eats. Thankfully, the Coffee Shop does do right by its various flavored caipirinhas, which can easily become both the main course and the main reason for staying late into the night. Crowded weekend brunches, the Union Square Lounge in the basement, and, in summer, outdoor tables set out along the sidewalk make Coffee Shop at least an all-access hangout&#151;even if the high-fashion atmosphere has gone a little too department store.","12/7/2009","212-243-7969","Fact check inRaw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit in","","10003","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","CoffeeShopUnionSquareLounge","","BC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From his early innovators Patria and Chicama sprang disciples who helmed their own kitchens, including both the original chef at Calle Ocho, Cuban Alex Garcia, and its current maestro, Peruvian Jorge Adriazola. In succession they&#146;ve fueled the supernova and continued post-hype popularity of the Upper West Side's nuevo Latino giant. And giant it is. The dining room, which is nearly hidden from view from the tropical mod lounge in the front room, was originally the courtyard of a U-shaped hotel. Now, enclosed by a skylight, it's an atrium made less cavernous by a false ceiling of wooden slats that frames the room to look smaller than it is. Oversized, wavy lampshades and large-scale wall decorations also cut the room down to size for a mix of middle-aged cronies, families and couples in their 20s and 30s. The oft-praised lobster ceviche with mango-grapefruit mojo remains a must-try, or order the crispy snapper with malanga mash or sliced hanger steak over gallo pinto and fig sauce.","12/7/2009","212-873-5025","Fact check inRaw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit inReady to galley","","10024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","CalleOcho","","BC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"Classic NY spot","","","","","","You wouldn&#146;t think of such a stunning classic as a backdrop to activism, but in the &#146;60s, Gloria Steinem refused to vacate the then for-men-only premises, even after the manager removed her table.

The Mexican standbys, particularly the heaping nachos and burritos, incorporate noticeably fresh ingredients and have a leg up on the hit-or-miss burgers and popcorn shrimp. The windows that form the front wall and afford a tree-top view of Broadway are opened when it's warm, and so is a roof deck.","3/24/2008","212-866-7035","Fact check inRaw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit in","","10025","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","cheap eats","HeightsBarGrill","View of Broadway","BC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.heightsnyc.com",""

Dinnertime is packed with tables of two - surprising to see muscle distributed so equally among boyfriends. The dim light and subdued beat music are always perfect for gay courtship. ""Appeteasers"" such as the crabcake and the quesadilla with mixed veggies truly tease you into thinking that the entrees will be just as scrumptious. Alas, the weight-conscious clientele may be the reason why the food here lacks rich flavor or (dare I say) creamy calories. While offering multiple options of pasta, chicken, fish, and even steak dishes, Foodbar somehow manages to score high on presentation and low on taste. Angel hair with grilled sea scallops, tomato, and broccoli rabe was generous on the pepper and undercooked on the seafood. The tamarind-grilled salmon with lime leaf broth was black on top and accompanied by bland jasmine rice. If you actually splurge on dessert, steer clear from the dry chocolate truffle cake and definitely dig into the restaurant-recommended key lime pie. On the way to the restroom, get a load of the random cathedral-like setting of assorted Virgin Mary paintings. Maybe if you say your prayers beforehand, you and your date can skip dessert and head home early. For Sunday brunch, get an eyeful of the various guy gangs working off hangovers generated by last night's partying at Earth or The Roxy. Nothing beats male bonding over an $11.95 prix fixe meal or the hearty ""Chelsea Boy Special"" (4 scrambled egg whites, chicken breast, and steamed spinach).","5/20/2008","212-243-2020","Raw review inFact check inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit in","","10011","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Foodbar","","BC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On one evening, this cornucopia held a blade of endive cradling aromatic Roquefort cheese and walnuts; a cigarillo-shaped pastry filled with mint-and-paprika-seasoned beef; savory albacore tuna salad spiked with anchovy atop a crunchy baguette; and the traditional tortilla espanola with egg, potato and onion. The assortment only faltered once with skewered morsels of octopus that were a tad over-cooked. Spain&#146;s seafaring heritage shines in a paella replete with clams, mussels, calamari and shrimp, and cut through with the spice of char-grilled chorizo sausage. Other seafood on offer includes roast monkfish; Atlantic scallops; and tomato bouillon with monkfish, shrimp, mussels, and clams. Carnivores can feast on buttery filet mignon in a rich brandy and green peppercorn sauce, accompanied by patatas bravas &#8211; golden fried potatoes, perfectly shaped for dipping in a velvety aoli. While ordering dessert may not be top-of-mind at a Spanish restaurant, don&#146;t make that mistake at Oliva. Try the cool vanilla flan glazed with black cherry confiture, or the warm chocolate almond torte &#8211; light, moist and not-too-sweet, it may just be the best dish on the menu.","6/6/2008","212-228-4143","Raw review inFact check inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit in","many s panish wines","10002","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Oliva","","BC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Amex, DC, Disc, MC, V.As recently as the late '90s, observers from critics to diners declared the Upper West Side the frontier of Manhattan perhaps most neglected in its desire for high-quality restaurants. The idea that this was a myth was novel enough to be a publishable column. Newcomers at the time, Calle Ocho, Ruby Foo's and Ocean Grill were hailed as significant steps in the right direction, and since it opened in 2001, artistically appointed French eatery Jean-Luc has certainly joined them. Chef Eric Le Dily brings his experience at Raoul's to the notable grilled red snapper with earthy red beet gnocchi and an array of immaculate appetizers. Shrimp Napoleon in champagne sauce and bison carpaccio serve as estimable supporting players to the tarragon-tinged lobster bisque. A singles scene of West Siders in their 30s thrives at the large bar area in the front of the space, while families, retirees and the young and beautiful take to the ostrich-leather banquettes of the dining room. Regardless of where they're sitting, patrons should avail themselves of a wine list specifically created to vie for a Wine Spectator award, assembled by David Sturno, ""21"" Club's sommelier.","10/28/2008","212-712-1700","Fact check inRaw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit inReady to galley","","10024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JeanLuc(CLOSED","","BC","yes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patrons get what they pay for from many entrees, including a respectable $20 filet mignon that otherwise would appear to be a bargain. Mussels in chipotle broth, duck confit salad and Japanese eggplant typify the laudable selection of international starters, although a seared foie gras overpowered by its eggy sauce leads the list of appetizers prepared non-traditionally or just plain off.

Is it the meditative floating-candle pond in the front window? Is it the long wood bar with a lit-up distressed-glass base and an open DJ booth perched overhead? Is it the soothing muted-cream back lounge outfitted in roomy booths and antique chandeliers, and sprinkled with comfortable leather loveseats? You bet. But mostly it's Anju's whole communal feng-shui philosophy to dining that makes the restaurant seem to belong to that novelty fusion era of the moneyed 90s when Eastern ethos and spalike food therapy was served with a lofty price tag and without a hint of irony. At the top of Anju's menu, there is a little blurb about ""holistic consciousness,"" the value of sharing with friends, and mind, body, and spiritual interconnectedness. But even for those who don't need an emotional upgrade at dinner or who like when only their silverware touches their entree, Anju provides some intriguing leaps with cuisine. The dining room is cordoned off to the front area of the airy high-ceilinged space, with chairs and banquettes situated underneath a wall of intersecting wood slats and a view of the street. Six-figure-salaried couples and young groups of Korean friends fill up the tables, sipping the bar's signature exotic cocktails (complete with names like ""Apparition"" and ""Eclipse""). Anju also boasts an impressive wine list, not only separated into red and white but further divided by mood (Seductive, Meditative, Rejuvenating, or Luscious). But it's really the food where Anju makes up for its new-age mentality. Anju is Korean for ""plate"" and the menu is divided into dishes of small or large portions (presumably based on how much you want to share). Start with Anju's specialty rolls, four fresh shrimp wrapped with raw carrot and drizzled in a sweet honey mustard. The dish's simplicity emphasizes the kitchen's attention to pure, profound ingredients. The barbecue offerings are probably the most popular fare, mainly because a small earthen grill is placed in the center of the table, and raw paper-thin slices of bul go gi (rib eye) or kal bi (short ribs) are served for DIY grilling. Wrapped in a lettuce leaf with sliver of beets and dipped in one of three sauces, the first-rate quality of the meats is indeed enlightening. The fish and noodle section is equally life-affirming (particularly the house-recommended black cod simmered in a heavenly spicy, garlic reduction), but don't be surprised if, by the time the entr&eacute;es are served, a red-rope is placed at the door, house music blares at full volume, and the feng-shui attitude is quickly replaced with lusty guidos and bridge-and-tunnel fashion nightmares cruising each other. Quickly the dining room becomes an extension of the dance floor, leaving many customers to cancel orders for a liquid dinner, or flee the embarrassingly bad nightclub scene entirely. Anju does have a small red-and-pink-colored side room downstairs called the ""sake therapy lounge,"" which boosts eight house-customized sake drinks, but if that isn't enough of an asylum, better as a rule to eat early and leave when the DJ rolls his records in.

The gigantic silhouette beam of a cow skull projected onto the next door building beckons an eclectic but loyal crowd of local country-music folk, Manhattan natives who miss their Texas home, and foreign tourists who want a different taste of the old USA. But whoever is crowded around the bar or eating at the tables, they all get to enjoy the free live music, ranging from country to rockabilly, alt country to bluegrass that plays nightly. Of course even when the bands arenât twanging, the wagon-wheel lamps, antler chandeliers, ropes, saddles, neon beer signs, and rodeo memorabilia set the right mood for the extensive Tex Mex menu. Start with the cowboy kisses, succulent shrimp covered with a fried jalapeno pepper and wrapped with a strip of bacon. The appetizer comes with a watery chipotle sauce, but even alone, itâs hotter than a firecracker in August and too darned delicious to stop. In terms of entrees, most of the menu sticks to traditional Tex Mex favorites-three-cheese quesadillas, chicken fried chicken, and some seriously rich barbequed ribs and chicken are among the hits. The crispy catfish, served with mashed potatoes with the peels thrown in, is surprising light underneath its potent fried crust and the moderately priced Texas steaks are as tender and juicy as anything served this side of the Mason Dixie. Houston would be proud. Of course, washing it all down with one of the Rodeoâs famous $26 pitchers of frozen margaritas (it comes in six different flavors) will have you singing like Johnny Cash and staggering like Vince Gill in no time.

Designed by Hugh Hardy and situated in the eye-catching Gordon Bunshaft building, the main showstopper is the snaking staircase that segues the otherwise upwardly mobile and polished clientele down into the lounge and dining room. Ferdinand L&eacute;ger&#146;s only known stained glass piece, which divides the open kitchen from the dining room, is an attraction unto itself. And who wouldn&#146;t want to stare at the rest of the room from extra-deep leather banquettes&#151;simply made for intimate under-the-table moments? While this spot might be a beacon for fans of buffed chrome and sweeping Guggenheim-esque spaces, Brasserie 8 1/2 serves up more than song and dance. While incumbent bistro classics like steak frites and c&ocirc;te de boeuf paired with airy pommes souffl&eacute;s shine, chef Julian Alonzo, who studied under David Bouley and Paris&#146;s Guy Savoy, takes a cue from his surroundings and throws in some modern angles. Black sesame-flecked tuna tartare with passion fruit cream and grated-at-your-table wasabi will entice you to boycott single-minded sushi, and a crispy jumbo-lump crab cake finds a fresh edge in its sidekick salad of sea beans and razor-thin artichokes. As you pause for breath in between courses, take a gander around the room. Matisse artwork dons the walls, and if looked at from the lounge, the L&eacute;ger glasswork makes sense as a design element rather than a dining room diversion. The unpretentious and pulled-together vibe plays out in the white-chocolate mousse and devil&#146;s food cake ring ding. It&#146;s delicious enough to make you forget about the artwork and the ambience and devote all of your attention to what&#146;s on the plate.

Flickering candles decorated withmagnifying glass sets a romantic mood, but the wine bar doesn't stay old-worldfor long.

In the unlikely event that you have room for dessert, the apple strudel and chocolate mousse cake are recommended. Afterwards, while you rub your belly and wonder how you could have ingested so much, be sure to take in the environs - the charming old-fashioned booths, the stained glass windows, the cuckoo clock. If your visit coincides with a holiday, check out the decorations: the staff hang 27,000 fairy lights around the dining room every Christmas; inflate hundreds of red and pink balloons for Valentineâs Day; and install hundreds of fresh flowers and vines for Rolfâs annual Spring festival.","3/10/2009","212-477-4750","Fact check inRaw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit in","","10010","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","RolfsRestaurant","","BC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ten drafts include the malty Maredsous 8 and biting La Chouffe, and there are nearly 30 bottled beers, many of them Trappist (Westmalle, Rochefort)&#151;a solid, enjoyable lineup.

The owners hired Sylvain Bazinet, a partner in Chelsea&#146;s slick Open lounge, to revamp the former bar Totem. Bazinet brought in TV tables and a drop-down screen to show art videos&#151;and occasional soccer games, as the name suggests&#151;and he installed black slate floors and cedar paneling to update the look. The menu will evolve as business picks up, with a limited selection of panini to start. The signature drink is the Mundial Mango, a frilly blend of mango vodka, triple sec and lime juice.

"","","","","","","There&#146;s a certain ilk of New York bars that, at first glance, are decidedly ordinary&#151;they offer nothing special in terms of drinks, decor or anything else. Somehow, though, these unassuming, often rundown spots transcend any one of a number of stereotypes and provide pub crawlers with a terrific bar experience. No place fits the bill better than TriBeCa Tavern. While the decor borders on decrepit (TriBeCa Tavern may be a contender for Manhattan&#146;s Worst Restroom), it&#146;s actually quite homey: Ample tables provide plenty of seating space, but the real prize is up front, where a cozy enclave provides patrons with a view of bustling West Broadway. The friendly bartenders are more than happy to whip up whatever drink you desire, though the reasonably priced draft beer, served by the pitcher, is really the way to go. The standard digital jukebox and surprisingly good sound system, like most things at this great little bar, sound better than you would&#146;ve thought.","NYCVisit: Trendsetter","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tribeca","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11am&#8211;4am","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21670","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","247 West Broadway between Walker and White Sts","Tribeca Tavern","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-941-7671","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average drink: $5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bars","","Subway: A, C, E to Canal St; 1 to Franklin St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11/9/2007","212-941-7671","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TribecaTavern","","BC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bar 108&#146;s spartan name echoes its straightforward concept: comfy leather banquettes, eight TVs showing anything from ESPN to CNN and more than 30 international beers. Until the kitchen opens in March, the grub is equally everyman: panini, wings and salads. The one courtly concession: specialty cocktails like the brow-raising 4 Godfathers (Jack Daniel&#146;s, Johnnie Walker Black, Jim Beam and Jose Cuervo).","","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Greenwich Village","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Wed 4pm&#8211;midnight; Thu 4pm&#8211;2am; Fri 2pm&#8211;4am; Sat noon&#8211;4am; Sun noon&#8211;midnight","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","22332","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","108 W Houston St at Thompson St","Bar 108","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-505-2015","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average drink: $8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bars","","Subway: A, C, E, B, D, F, V to W 4th St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY 698 NTW Jordana Rothman &#8211; Assign","","2/6/2009","212-505-2015","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bar108","","BC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"","","","","","","Like a starlet with beauty but no talent, this refined tavern offers lots of flash (see the requisite old-timey trappings) and little substance. Beer is the drink of choice, but the 16 drafts are mostly static, with warhorses (Blue Moon) trotted out alongside treats (Belhaven&#146;s gently hopped Thistle IPA). The wine selection, meanwhile, is sparse, with just a handful of offerings that read better than they taste. Ditto the food: The haddock in the fish-and-chips was the picture of golden-fried perfection, but quickly disintegrated into greasy lumps.

An oblivious, dude-heavy crowd undermines the ornate 19th-century interior and the tasteful beverage list, which includes an easy-drinking proprietary wine, rare whiskeys (look out for the nine Glenmorangie Scotches) and a broad collection of craft beers.

"","","","","","","Barkeep Phil Ward focuses on tequila and its cousin, mescal, at this East Village haute cantina. His wonderful menu features a cool-as-marble Cinquenta Cinquenta&#151;a pairing of chamomile-infused <em>reposado</em> tequila and white vermouth that goes down like iced tea. The Slynx cocktail is a liquid campfire of aged tequila, applejack, bitters and a smoky rinse of mescal. The craftsmanship in the drinks is equaled in the bar menu, featuring juicy pork bellies. Despite its many strengths, Mayahuel wears its ambitions lightly. With so many of today&#146;s top-tier cocktail bars lousy with vanity, that humility is a welcome departure.","Noteworthy cocktailsNoted mixologistFoodConversation-friendlyDate placeNYCVisit: Culture buffNYCVisit: TrendsetterSpecialty drinksSpecialty spirits","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","yes","","East Village","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Sat 6pm&#8211;2am; Sun 11am&#8211;4pm, 6pm&#8211;2am","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","22358","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","304 E 6th St between First and Second Aves","Mayahuel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-253-5888","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average drink: $13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bars","","Subway: F, V to Lower East Side&#8211;Second Ave; 6 to Astor Pl","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY 709 NTW Daniel Gritzer","","10/22/2009","212-253-5888","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mayahuel","","BC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","mayahuelny.com",""

The cocktails alone almost pull it off: The Karzai blends Hennessy, egg white and poppy-seed puree; the Sommerwind juxtaposes lychee and cucumber in riesling in a fruity, fragrant melange.

Other cocktails&#151;like the overwhelmingly salty, anchovy-garnished, vodka-and-Sambuca-based Moby Dick&#151;make it clear why the hipster crowd favors the beer menu: a well-curated list of 46 foreign and domestic microbrews.","FoodGood for large groupsGreat viewsNoteworthy cocktailsNYCVisit: Culture buffSinglesSpecialty drinksSpecialty spiritsTrendy","Cash only","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lower East Side","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Daily 11am&#8211;midnight","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","22366","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","77 Delancey St at Allen St","White Slab Palace","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-334-0913","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average drink: $10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bars","","Subway: F to Delancey St; J, M, Z to Delancey&#8211;Essex Sts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY JO 702 Francoise Villeneuve","","6/5/2009","212-334-0913","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WhiteSlabPalace","","BC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are 18 German brews on tap (crisp Radeberger pilsner, bitter Oktoberfest Hofbr&auml;u lager) and many more by the bottle. And there are plenty of affordable, satisfying small plates&#151;like Berlin&#146;s classic <em>currywurst.</em> Where Der Schwarze falls short is its appearance: Despite a prime corner location and huge wrap-around windows, the space suffers from a sparse and generic design.

"","","","","","","Designer Lauren Rottet crafted this deco beauty as a nod to Coco Chanel, an homage that&#146;s quite appropriate in the heart of the Upper East Side. The bar, owned by Daniel Boulud and located across the Surrey lobby from Caf&eacute; Boulud, is framed in black lacquered panels that recall an elegant makeup compact. If you&#146;re used to sipping serious cocktails in neo-speakeasies, the luxe setting and monied, buttoned-up crowd might seem a little stiff. But the drinks, crafted by Cameron Bogue (from DB Bistro Moderne in Vancouver), are so exquisitely executed and downright delicious, you won&#146;t mind sharing your banquette with a suit. As at Caf&eacute; Boulud, the menu is divided into four categories: &#147;la tradition&#148; (classics), &#147;la saison&#148; (seasonal), &#147;le potager&#148; (vegetal), and &#147;le voyage&#148; (global). Amongthe three traditional tipples was a gorgeous Sloe Gin Fizz ($16), aneasy-sipping stunner that combined tart Plymouth sloe gin with lemon juice and homemade rhubarb bitters, crowned with a silky egg-white head. The aptly named La Terre ($15, from le potager) is an earthy, complexblend of red vermouth, Aperol, grapefruit juice and beet-infused gin (made in-house, as are many of the tinctures, bitters and infusions). Bogue&#146;s mixology finds afine complement in a selection of canap&eacute;s from Caf&eacute; Boulud. Arriving on a tiered silver platter are savory mouthfuls like flaky <em>goug&egrave;res</em> and <em>arancini</em> with flecks of black truffle. All of this refinement will cost you: Canap&eacute;s for four is $28, and cocktails top out at $19. It&#146;s well worth the price.","Conversation-friendlyDate placeFoodNoted mixologistNoteworthy cocktailsNYCVisit: Glamour houndNYCVisit: TrendsetterNYCVisit: RomanticNYCVisit: Power brokerSpecialty drinksSpecialty spirits","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","yes","","Upper East Side","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Daily noon&#8211;midnight","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","22426","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","The Surrey, 20 E 76th St between Fifth and Madison Aves","Bar Pleiades","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-772-2600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average cocktail: $18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bars","","Subway: 6 to 77th St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY 733 NTW Daniel Gritzer","","12/11/2009","212-772-2600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$$","BarPleiades","","BC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","danielnyc.com",""

"","","","","","","The Bowery Hotel&#146;s ornate lobby bar, from veteran hoteliers Eric Goode and Sean MacPherson (both of the Maritime Hotel), is among the city&#146;s most inviting settings for a drink. Plush velvet couches and chairs, Middle Eastern tilework, Turkish rugs and the green sprays of palm leaves share space with dark, wood-paneled walls sporting antlers and paintings of hounds. The combined effect falls between an officer&#146;s club in the colonial Far East and an aristocrat&#146;s hunting lodge in the British countryside. The luxurious decor is a throwback to the grand hotel bars of yesteryear, except unlike many of those stalwarts still operating in New York today, the bartenders here can mix a decent (albeit pricey) drink. We were especially partial to the namesake Bowery Cocktail ($18), an aromatic concoction that layered Bulldog gin with the sweet-spiced flavor of Dubonnet and a splash of celebratory champagne. The absinthe-based Dutch Courage ($16), meanwhile, is sure to please licorice lovers with its anise notes and fresh muddled mint. Unfortunately, only hotel guests can order food from the adjacent Gemma restaurant in the bar area, though perhaps a skilled negotiator can convince someone to bend the rules&#151;a tactic you may have to employ to score seats on the lovely heated back patio, also reserved for guests only.","Conversation-friendlyDate placeFireplaceGardenOutdoor seatingLoungeNoteworthy cocktailsNYCVisit: RomanticNYCVisit: TrendsetterNYCVisit: Glamour houndSpecialty drinksSpecialty spiritsTrendy","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","yes","","East Village","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu, Sun 6pm&#8211;2am; Fri, Sat 6pm&#8211;4am","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","22445","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","335 Bowery at 3rd St","The Lobby Bar at the Bowery Hotel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-505-9100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average cocktail: $16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bars","","Subway: 6 to Astor Pl","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY Hotel Bar feature 742.743 Daniel Gritzer","","12/11/2009","212-505-9100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$$","LobbyBarattheBoweryHotel","","BC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","theboweryhotel.com",""

"","","","","","","When the Ace Hotel opened a New York outpost last spring, it brought with it the city&#146;s first Stumptown caf&eacute;, guaranteeing early-morning crowds in need of artisan coffee. But the massive space, its soaring ceiling punctuated by trunk-thick columns, has ended up having more than just a.m. appeal; it&#146;s become a popular spot for all types, at all hours. Techies punch away on their laptops along library-style communal tables, models strut to and fro, small groups spread out on mismatched sofas, and flannel-clad hipsters huddle around the bar at the back of the wood-paneled room. The crowd also tends to spill into the Breslin, the Ace Hotel&#146;s sceney restaurant from Ken Friedman and April Bloomfield (both of the Spotted Pig). This paean to British cookery features two pubby bars (one downstairs and one in an upstairs mezzanine); Friedman and Bloomfield also operate the lobby bar, which offers a menu similar to its Breslin counterparts. Among the many great suds, don&#146;t miss the proprietary Breslin Aberdeen ($8) by Sixpoint Craft Ales, a hand-pumped, cask-conditioned, Scotch-style ale. The barely chilled brew has only the slightest carbonation and a pleasant acidity that goes down easy. We also fell hard for the Breslin Bloody Mary ($11), a version that gives horseradish-spiked organic tomato juice and vodka a crowning garnish of pickled vegetables and smoked okra. Bloomfield&#146;s lip-smacking fare&#151;&#147;thrice-cooked chips&#148; (some of the best thick-cut fries you&#146;ll find; $7); a crunchy and gooey three-cheese grilled cheese sandwich ($16); and a board of cured meats, sausages and housemade terrines ($16)&#151;makes an ideal companion to the drinks.","","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","yes","","Midtown West","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Daily noon&#8211;2am","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","22449","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ace Hotel, 20 W 29th St at Broadway","The Lobby Bar at the Ace Hotel New York","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-679-2222","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average drink: $9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bars","","Subway: B, D, F, V, N, Q, R, W to 34th St&#8211;Herald Sq","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY Hotel Bar feature 742.743 Daniel Gritzer","","12/11/2009","212-679-2222","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","LobbyBarattheAceHotelNewYork","","BC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","acehotel.com/newyork","yes"
"","","","","","","Maialino, the Gramercy Park Hotel&#146;s new trattoria, has the makings of another Danny Meyer blockbuster: solid, rustic Italian fare; a packed house; and a bustling enoteca that is quickly becoming one of the neighborhood&#146;s most desirable spots to down a glass of wine. The buzzy bar area was standing-room-only on a recent visit, with the various counters, cozy two-tops and stools all occupied. A Berkel slicer whirs in one corner, dispatching gossamer ribbons of prosciutto and <em>speck.</em> The wine list is all Italian and mercifully compact; most of the selections are available by the bottle, <em>quartino</em> and glass (many are less than $10). We liked a full, fruity Barbera d&#146;Alba ($11 a glass), but the room is festive enough to merit a sparkler, like one of two proseccos ($7&#8211;$15 a glass) or an $8 lambrusco (a young, fizzy red wine). If you&#146;re planning on making a meal of the excellent <em>salumi,</em> cheeses and small plates on the bar menu, perhaps indulge in one of the excellent apertivi. The Aviation ($13)&#151;made with Plymouth gin, and maraschino and violet liqueurs&#151;was a floral complement to whipped lardo on toast, sprinkled with coarse rosemary salt ($4). The bitterness of a classic spritz (white wine, Campari and club soda; $13) cut the richness of the <em>cacciatorini</em> (pork salami, $7). All of this bodes well for the Gramercy Park Hotel&#146;s penthouse bar, accessible for now only via keycard. Though it&#146;s currently operated by the hotel, team Meyer plans to take over management of the space in 2010. With its series of richly appointed chambers, a wood-burning fireplace and low-slung couches surrounded by greenery, it&#146;s one of the city&#146;s most beautiful hideaways. If the bar at Maialino is any indication, Gramercy could soon have another nightlife destination on its hands.","","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","yes","","Gramercy/Flatiron","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Daily 5pm&#8211;midnight","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","22450","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Gramercy Park Hotel, 2 Lexington Ave at 21st St","Bar Maialino","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-777-2410","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average drink: $15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Bars","","Subway: 6 to 23rd St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY Hotel Bar Feature 742.743 Jordana Rothman","","12/11/2009","212-777-2410","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","BarMaialino","","BC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","gramercyparkhotel.com/restaurant",""
