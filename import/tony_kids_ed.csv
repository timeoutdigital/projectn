"","","","","","","Since 1995, crowds have been vying for seats beneath this trattoria&#146;s canopy of red Christmas lights. Although a slew of cut-rate Italian eateries have since joined the East Village neighborhood, diners still endure long waits and blas&eacute; service for a stab at Il Bagatto&#146;s affordable, well-executed dishes. Of course, there are worse places to wait than the woodsy bar, where a ceiling of tangled branches hovers above patrons sipping from a selection of 10 by-the-glass wines and 60 bottled choices. Once seated, the room is so tightly packed, it&#146;s hard to resist sticking your fork in your neighbor&#146;s <em>gnochetti verdi e blu</em> (spinach gnocchi in Gorgonzola sauce). The tiny open kitchen also makes garlicky mussels and <em>tagliolini</em> with a seafood-laden tomato sauce. It&#146;s great for a big family dinner on Sunday, when you can order meaty homestyle specials like lasagna, and osso buco with mashed potatoes.","Reservations requiredTakeoutCateringFull barNotable wine listGay-friendlyVegetarian-friendlyTrendyDate placeDeliveryConversation-friendlyNo steps at entranceWheelchair accessible bathroomBar scene","AmEx ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","","","East Village","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tue&#8211;Thu 5:30&#8211;11:45pm; Fri, Sat 5:30pm&#8211;12:45am; Sun 5&#8211;10:45pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","192 E 2nd St between Aves A and B","Il Bagatto","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-228-0977","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Italian: $16-24","","Subway: F, V to Lower East Side&#8211;Second Ave","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ebarr","x","5/26/2004","212-228-0977","Raw review inFact check inFinal edit inFirst edit inCopy edit in","Well priced; all Italian","10009","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$$","IlBagatto","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ilbagattonyc.com ",""

"","","","","","","Even though soups are featured prominently on its kosher menu, the prospect of visiting such a simply monikered joint in this otherwise impersonable, gray neighborhood did not exactly have us salivating. It was a great surprise, then, to find a spacious, comfortable, beautifully Art Deco-styled and super-child-friendly oasis. Boasting four kinds of quintessential chicken soup&#8211;chicken and rice, along with three varieties of chicken-noodle (plain, with beef-filled kreplach or with a matzo ball)&#8211;plus a mushroom-barley and an always-changing soup of the day, this is a must-visit soup spot for kids. If you&#146;re not a carnivore (even the mushroom soup is meat-based), you needn&#146;t be left out in the cold: Tasty small-plate vegetarian items like house-made knishes, potato pancakes and spinach logs will warm you up, too.","CateringTakeoutVegetarian-friendlyWine & beer onlyKid-friendly","AmEx, DC, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","","","Midtown West","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Daily 11am&#8211;9pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1166","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","209 W 38th St between Seventh and Eighth Aves","Ben&#146;s Kosher Delicatessen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-398-2367","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Kosher","","Subway: N, Q, R, W, 42nd St S, 1, 2, 3, 7 to 42nd St&#8211;Times Sq","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","hh hold for deli sidebar","","6/18/2003","212-398-2367","","","10018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","BensKosherDelicatessen","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.bensdeli.net",""

While &agrave; la carte dinners are certainly an alluring (if pricey) option, the all-you-can-eat weekend buffet is a real steal&#151;$14 per person, and kids eat for half price. It packs a spicy punch with (take a deep breath): one lamb and two chicken dishes (saucy curry and tender tandoori), four vegetable dishes, several appetizers, rice, fluffy nan and two desserts.

"","","","","","","Should you wish to make soup the centerpiece of dinner rather than just a starter, look no further than Blue Ribbon&#146;s swank Fifth Avenue outpost in Park Slope. It is exceedingly welcoming to families, even though it&#146;s open evenings only (well, a 4pm weekend dinner could almost be called lunch). Among the great selection, our favorites include the spicy fish, filled with what seems like an ocean&#146;s worth of protein; garlicky cream of tomato; and the famed matzo ball soup. None are cheap (ranging from around $7-$11), but portions are huge, and the list of eminently shareable raw-bar specials, appetizers and salads with which to expand your meal is enticing, to say the least.

A jumble of antique cooking gear surrounds the enthusiastic diners who fill the farmhouse-kitchen tables at this longtime comfort-food haven. Plates of Uncle Red&#146;s Addiction (honey-dipped fried chicken, which tastes candied) and the house best-seller, macaroni and cheese (covered with a crisp savory crust), are as delicious as they are generously apportioned. Unfortunately, the service can be uneven: On our most recent visit, the server was more interested in showing off quasi&#8211;-cheesy kung fu moves to the hostess than in bringing us our food.","Outdoor seatingTakeoutGay-friendlyKid-friendlyBrunchDeliveryDate placeConversation-friendlyCateringFull barDining at barNYCVisit: Family","AmEx, DC, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","yes","","Gramercy/Flatiron","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Fri 11am&#8211;midnight; Sat 10am&#8211;midnight; Sun 10am&#8211;11pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10 E 16th St between Fifth Ave and Union Sq West","Chat &#146;n&#146; Chew","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-243-1616","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American Regional","","Subway: L, N, Q, R, W, 4, 5, 6 to 14th St&#8211;Union Sq","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","uu","x","6/1/2004","212-243-1616","Fact check inRaw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit in","","10003","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","ChatnChew","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.chatnchewnyc.com",""

"","","","","","","Charles Gabriel grew up cooking for his 19 siblings in North Carolina, so he knows from Southern cuisine. His Harlem kitchen launches a multilateral assault on the arteries, offering breakfast, fried seafood, takeout fare and an eat-in buffet. He whips up four specials a day&#151;mostly soulful grub like panfried chicken, barbecued ribs, meaty oxtails, flash-fried whiting and pork chops smothered in peppery brown gravy. The decor isn&#146;t all that special, but the fried chicken will make you forget your surroundings&#151;it&#146;s some of the best in the city, with tender, juicy meat and a crispy exterior.

"Private parties","","","","","","Next time you&#146;re strolling around Soho, stop by this longtime favorite, which maintains the same successful formula honed in the days when galleries (not chain stores) ruled the neighborhood. Owner Jerry Joseph mixes diner cool with &#146;80s artiness: red booths, a wall of Ralph Gibson and Starn Twins originals, and a black-clad waitstaff. Executive chef Eric Thomas, formerly of BLT Steak, serves comfort food with French bistro influences. Grilled portobello-mushroom pizza and piquant citrus-braised short ribs are popular with regulars, many of whom bring their kids (ages 8 and under eat free from the kids&#146; menu in early evening).","CateringDeliveryBrunchFull barVegetarian-friendlyTrendyNo steps at entranceReservations requiredTakeoutClassic NYSolo diningDate placeKid-friendlyBar sceneWheelchair accessible bathroom","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","yes","","Soho","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1364","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","101 Prince St between Greene and Mercer Sts","Jerry&#146;s (CLOSED)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-966-9464","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average kids&#146; meal: $8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Caf&eacute;s & diners","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","E&D Maile Carpenter (first round)","x","","212-966-9464","Raw review inFact check inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit inReady to galley","","10012","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","mid-priced","Jerrys(CLOSED","Take-out Mon&#8211;Fri lunch and Sat brunch | Delivery lunchtime only","ED","yes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although a bit lighter than the usual stick-to-your-ribs recipe, the aromatic gumbo with tender pieces of chicken is a treat. Encourage young hot-dog lovers to sample the relatively mild red beans and rice, studded with andouille sausage. For dessert, try the syrupy cinnamon-raisin bread pudding, mammoth enough to satisfy a tableful of cravings.","DeliveryFull barDining at barBar sceneEntertainmentTakeoutCateringNo steps at entranceWheelchair accessible bathroom","AmEx, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","","live jazz fri/sat night","Midtown West","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon noon&#8211;midnight; Tue&#8211;Fri noon&#8211;midnight; Sat 11:30am&#8211;midnight; Sun 11:30am&#8211;midnight","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","700 Ninth Ave at 48th St","Delta Grill","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-956-0934","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American Regional","","Subway: C, E to 50th St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","rr ED05 Michael DeSimone","x","7/6/2004","212-956-0934","Fact check in","","10036","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","DeltaGrill","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","thedeltagrill.com",""

"","","","","","","At this buzzing Italian institution, arriving early is a must if you want to avoid waiting around: Families crowd the cozy, casual and surprisingly inexpensive spot&#146;s tables nightly. Although the menu features plenty of flavorful fish and meat entr&eacute;es, kids tend to order the simple, hearty pastas such as homemade gnocchi with tomato, cream and basil or spaghetti with cherry-tomato marinara sauce. The generous desserts (primarily Italian traditions like a delectable tiramisu and a lighter panna cotta) can easily be shared.","High chairsBooster seatsTakeoutDate placeConversation-friendlyDeliveryVegetarian-friendlyNo steps at entranceNotable wine listWine & beer onlyWheelchair accessible bathroom","Cash only","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","","","Upper West Side","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu, Sun 5&#8211;10:30pm; Fri, Sat 5&#8211;11pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1506","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","665 Amsterdam Ave between 92nd and 93rd Sts","Gennaro","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-665-5348","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Italian: $16-24","","Subway: 1, 2, 3 to 96th St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","uu","x","5/27/2004","212-665-5348","Fact check inRaw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit in","good and affordable ($20 range)","10025","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","Gennaro","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"","","","","","","Mama&#146;s Food Shop has long been a favorite of East Village hipsters on a budget, but it is also the perfect place to eat a home-cooked meal when you&#146;re not up for spending time in front of the stove. After entertaining the dining room&#8211;which looks like the living room of an artsy aunt who knows how to make killer fried chicken&#8211;we sidled up to a counter laden with bowls of colorful and simply prepared vegetables like brussles sprouts, roasted carrots and string beans with garlic. I loved that we were able to create our own plates, choosing one portion of meat or fish&#8211;such as fried or roasted chicken, meat loaf or grilled salmon&#8211;and two sides for $10. You can also go all-vegetarian: For Belle, I balanced a pile of mac and cheese with a side of honey-glazed sweet potatoes and broccoli (portions are not kid-sized, but the leftovers make for a great next-day lunch), and we shared my order of crunchy, succulent fried chicken. The cafeteria-style service is a big plus: You can order immediately, grab a seat in the living-dinning room and eat at your own pace. The constant buzz of activity in the open kitchen provided all the entertainment Belle needed.","Gay-friendlyTakeoutVegetarian-friendlySolo diningDeliveryCateringFull barNo steps at entranceNYCVisit: TrendsetterNYCVisit: ExplorerWheelchair accessible bathroom","Cash only","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","yes","","East Village","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Sat 11am&#8211;10pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1526","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","200 E 3rd St between Aves A and B","Mama&#146;s Food Shop","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-777-4425","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American Regional","","Subway: F, V to Lower East Side&#8211;Second Ave","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","uu","","6/3/2004","212-777-4425","Fact check inRaw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit in","","10009","10009","","","","","","","10009","","","","","","","","","$","MamasFoodShop","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.mamasfoodshop.com",""

"","","","","","","Many of us still lament the loss of the original Sacred Chow, the deli-style vegan eatery on Hudson Street in the west Village. But its reincarnation in the heart of NYU-dom greatly improves upon the original. A deep-red-painted brick wall, fanciful grape-bunch lights dangling throughout and a small Turkish fountain give the place a calm Eastern vibe. Table service, new tapas offerings, beers on tap and a host of organic wines all enhance what is truly excellent, inventive fare. Best of all, you&#146;ll have no trouble recognizing the old Sacred Chow&#146;s signature soups and stews by name or taste: the Vietnamese sweet-potato&#146;s silken lightness and intense but soft flavors are still there, as is the dense richness of the black-bean chili soup. All the old favorites rotate as daily specials.","Gay-friendlyTakeoutDeliveryCateringVegetarian-friendlyNo steps at entranceConversation-friendlyKid-friendlySolo diningWheelchair accessible bathroomCheap eats","AmEx, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","","","Greenwich Village","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu, Sun 11am&#8211;10pm; Fri, Sat 11am&#8211;11pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1738","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","227 Sullivan St between Bleecker and W 3rd Sts ","Sacred Chow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-337-0863","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Vegetarian & Organic","","Subway: A, C, E, B, D, F, V to W 4th St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","E&D Sarah Breckenridge (first round)","x","4/18/2003","212-337-0863","Fact check inFinal edit inFirst edit inRaw review inCopy edit in","","10014","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","SacredChow","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","sacredchow.com",""

"","","","","","","Shabu Shabu 70, open since the Nixon administration, is a hidden gem on the Upper East Side. On a Sunday night we sat at a banquette in the front room, next to the bar (with a good view of the TV), and watched as a constant flow of regulars, including families with kids, came in and were greeted personally by the hostess and waitstaff. The sushi and Japanese specialties, like crab shumai and Japanese pickles, are well made and fresh, but we came for the fireworks known as the hot pot. For shabu-shabu, a cast-iron pot is filled with broth made from water, sake and seaweed, then placed on a burner at your table. The waiters bring you raw meat sliced so thin that it will cook in mere seconds, as well as a bowl of raw vegetables, silky udon noodles and two dipping sauces. For novices, the friendly waiters (who all sport shaggy mohawks) will get you started and provide instruction. Letting very young children take a turn at the pot is not recommended, but Belle was held rapt by our routine of dunking the ingredients and fishing them out. She also enjoyed the results, including the chance to dip her noodles and chicken into the sauces herself. Although a bit on the pricey side ($25 per person with a two-person minimum), two shabu-shabu orders can feed several people.","Date placeGood for large groupsTakeoutDeliveryCateringConversation-friendlyKid-friendlyFull bar","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","","","Upper East Side","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu, Sun 5&#8211;10:45pm; Fri, Sat 5&#8211;11:45pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1988","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","314 E 70th St between First and Second Aves","Shabu-Shabu 70","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-861-5635","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Japanese","","Subway: 6 to 68th St&#8211;Hunter College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","uu","","6/10/2004","212-861-5635","Fact check inRaw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit inReady to galley","","10021","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","ShabuShabu70","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"","","","","","","A beloved shawarma stop for Carroll Gardens and Cobble Hill families since 1998, Zaytoons serves Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian dishes. We like the fattoush salad ($4) and malphouf ($10), a Syrian stuffed cabbage filled with rice, beef and a hint of cinnamon. Other highlights include a spicy falafel and pillowy, baked-to-order pitas, perfect for scooping up hummus and tabouli. Walls hand-painted to resemble the thick bricks and archways of a Middle Eastern coffeehouse enhance the cozy atmosphere.","Cheap eats","AmEx, DC, Disc, MC, V","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","Cash only","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn, NY","Brooklyn, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","Brooklyn, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","","","Brooklyn: Carroll Gardens","Brooklyn: Fort Greene","","","","","","","Brooklyn: Prospect Heights","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu 11am&#8211;11pm; Fri, Sat 11am&#8211;midnight; Sun noon&#8211;10pm","Mon&#8211;Thu 11am&#8211;11pm; Fri, Sat 11am&#8211;midnight","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu, Sun noon&#8211;11pm; Fri-Sat noon&#8211;2am","","","","","","","","2000","472 Myrtle Ave between Hall St and Washington Ave, Fort Greene, Brooklyn","","","","","","","594 Vanderbilt Ave at St. Marks Ave","","","","","","","","283 Smith St between DeGraw and Sackett Sts","Zaytoons","Zaytoons","","","","","","","Zaytoons","","","","","","","","","718-875-1880","718-623-5522","","","","","","","718-230-3200","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $9","","","","","","","Average main course: $9","","","","","","","","Middle Eastern","","Subway: F, G to Carroll St","Subway: G to Clinton&#8211;Washington Aves","","","","","","","Subway: B, Q to Seventh Ave; 2, 3 to Grand Army Plaza","","","","","","","","","","rr ED05 Jem Aswad","x","5/3/2004","718-875-1880","Raw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit inFact check inReady to galley","","11231","11205","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","Zaytoons","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"","","","","","","This old pooch&#146;s newest trick: The owners of the cozy West Village institution of the same name offer a similar menu and family-friendly vibe in this eastern outpost. That means a selection of hearty sandwiches, burgers and salads for lunch and dinner, and the always-popular traditional brekkie options. The decor may be a bit more ambitious here than at the Carmine Street location (owners David Ethan and Peter Stein scoured antiques markets for the perfect accent pieces), but it&#146;s still laid-back. Get your tykes there before 9:30am on Saturdays and Sundays to avoid the rush, and fill up on brunch standards like challah French toast.","High chairsBooster seatsTakeoutVegetarian-friendlySolo diningBrunchDeliveryCateringWine & beer onlyDessert placeCheap eatsConversation-friendlyBreakfast","AmEx, MC, V","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","","","West Village","Greenwich Village","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Daily 7:30am&#8211;10:30pm","Daily 7:30am&#8211;10pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2233","90 University Pl between 11th and 12th Sts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","33 Carmine St between Bedford and Bleecker Sts","The Grey Dog&#146;s Coffee","Grey Dog","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-462-0041","212-414-4739","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Caf&eacute;s & diners","","Subway: A, C, E, B, D, F, V to W 4th St; 1 to Houston St","Subway: L, N, Q, R, W, 4, 5, 6 to 14th St&#8211;Union Sq","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Kate Lowenstein (first round)","x","6/1/2004","212-462-0041","Fact check inRaw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit in","","10014","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","GreyDogsCoffee","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","thegreydog.com",""

The eatery is best known for its doner ($12) and beyti ($12.50) kebabs and ezme, a fiery tomato salad ($5.50), but we prefer the simple dishes: perfectly blended red lentil soup ($4) squeezed with lemon; and the cacik ($5.25), a garlicky cucumber-and-yogurt sauce. Kids will likely go for the chicken kebab with french fries ($12.95) and the crisp, cinnamon-flavored baklava ($4.50).

The seasonal menu is all over the map&#151;Asian, American&#151;but kids go for the haute comfort items like gooey mac and cheese (optionally topped with roasted chicken breast or portobello mushrooms). A finely spiced slab of meat loaf conceals a pocket of melted cheddar, and the chicken noodle soup is perfectly homey, loaded with white meat, pastina, carrots and fresh herbs.","Good for large groupsDate placeSolo diningTrendyGarden seatingWheelchair accessible bathroomKid-friendly","AmEx, DC, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","","","Midtown West","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu, Sun 6am&#8211;11pm; Fri, Sat 6am&#8211;midnight","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3367","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hudson Hotel, 356 W 58th St between Eighth and Ninth Aves","Hudson Cafeteria","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-554-6500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American: $16-24","","Subway: A, C, B, D, 1 to 59th St&#8211;Columbus Circle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","rr ED05 Reed Tucker","x","5/28/2004","212-554-6500","Raw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit inFact check inReady to galley","","10019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","HudsonCafeteria","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.chinagrillmanagement.com",""

The soy-based broth is graced with superlative versions of the usual suspects&#151;tender slices of pork, fresh spinach, bamboo shoots, boiled egg, fish cake, scallions and nori, plus those glorious long noodles, cooked until ha gotai (think al dente, but in Japanese).","Conversation-friendlySolo diningWine & beer onlyCheap eatsTakeoutDeliveryNo steps at entranceNYCVisit: Culture buffNYCVisit: ExplorerNYCVisit: FamilyDate placeKid-friendlyLate nightNo reservations","Cash only","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","yes","","East Village","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Sat noon&#8211;2:30am; Sun noon&#8211;11:30pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3778","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","214 E 10th St between First and Second Aves","Rai Rai Ken","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-477-7030","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Japanese","","Subway: L to First Ave; N, R, W to 8th St&#8211;NYU; 6 to Astor Pl","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Karen Shimizu (E&D 2009)","x","6/6/2003","212-477-7030","Fact check inRaw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit inReady to galley","","10003-7706","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","RaiRaiKen","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"","","","","","","Is there anything this restaurant can&#146;t batter? The fish-and-chips here and at the shop&#146;s other location (129 Atlantic Ave between Clinton and Henry Sts, Cobble Hill) are among New York&#146;s best, whether you choose cod, haddock or plaice. This is also the spot for such U.K. classics as bangers and mash, Welsh rarebit and shepherd&#146;s pie. And for dessert, go for one of their famous deep-fried candy bars. The Monday&#8211;Thursday special (20% off the eat-in menu from 4:30 to 6:30pm) is a perk for the early-bedtime crowd.","Changing tablesHigh chairsDeliveryTakeoutKid-friendlyVegetarian-friendlyGood for large groupsLively sceneNo steps at entranceWheelchair accessible bathroomWine & beer onlyOutdoor seatingCheap eatsBar scene","","Cash only","","","","","","","Cash only","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn, NY","Brooklyn, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","Brooklyn, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","","","Brooklyn: Cobble Hill","Brooklyn: Park Slope","","","","","","","Brooklyn: Bay Ridge","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Wed noon&#8211;10pm; Thu, Fri noon&#8211;11pm; Sat 11am&#8211;11pm; Sun 11am&#8211;10pm","","","","","","","Fri&#8211;Sun noon&#8211;midnight; Mon&#8211;Thu noon&#8211;11pm","","","","","","","","3779","383 Fifth Ave at 6th St, Park Slope, Brooklyn","","","","","","","7215 Third Ave between 72nd and 73rd Sts","","","","","","","","129 Atlantic Ave between Henry and Clinton Sts","Atlantic Chip Shop","Chip Shop","","","","","","","The Bay Ridge Chip Shop","","","","","","","","","718-855-7775","718-832-7701, 718-244-7746","","","","","","","718-748-0594","","","","","","","","Average kids&#146; meal: $6","Average main course: $9","","","","","","","Average main course: $10","","","","","","","","British & Irish","","Subway: M, R to Court St; 2, 3, 4, 5 to Borough Hall","Subway: F, M, R to Fourth Ave&#8211;9th St","","","","","","","Subway: R to Bay Ridge Ave&#8211;4th Ave","","","","","","","","","","uu","x","6/10/2004","718-855-7775","Fact check inRaw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit inReady to galley","","11215-3304","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","AtlanticChipShop","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.chipshopnyc.com",""

None of his enterprises stay small for long, and this one, which expanded into the next-door space, is no different.

The Classic Margharita is lavishly sauced, while the cheeseless Bianca is liberally brushed with truffle oil and flecked with rosemary.","Booster seatsHigh chairsGarden seatingGood for large groupsLively sceneTakeoutDeliveryKid-friendlyVegetarian-friendlyTrendySolo diningOutdoor seatingDining at barFull barCateringNo steps at entranceWheelchair accessible bathroomLate night","Cash only","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","","","East Village","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu, Sun 10:30am&#8211;2am; Fri, Sat 10:30am&#8211;4am","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4850","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","19 First Ave between 1st and 2nd Sts","Lil&#146; Frankie&#146;s Pizza","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-420-4900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Italian: Pizza ","","Subway: F, V to Lower East Side&#8211;Second Ave","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","nn ED05 Jill Donenfeld","","6/18/2003","212-420-4900","Raw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit in","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","LilFrankiesPizza","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.lilfrankies.com",""

"","","","","","","Beloved by brides-to-be and Disney-adoring children, this magical spot offers much more than $9 pots of tea. The brunch menu is fit for royalty, with Alice&#146;s Curious French Toast (it&#146;s drenched in fruit coulis, vanilla cr&egrave;me anglaise and syrup) and scones in scrumptious flavors like blueberry and pumpkin. Special occasion? Outfit your fairy-princess-in-training with a pair of glittery wings, available for purchase at the store&#146;s gift shop. And don&#146;t worry if there&#146;s a line. Alice&#146;s has an interior waiting area with reading material for parents and assorted furry figures, including a grinning Cheshire cat, for kids to play with.","Vegetarian-friendlyTakeoutCateringKid-friendlyBrunchWheelchair accessible bathroomPrivate roomsDessert placeNYCVisit: Family","AmEx, Disc, MC, V","AmEx, DC, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","AmEx, DC, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","Bronx, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","yes","","Upper West Side","Bronx: City Island","","","","","","","Upper East Side","Upper East Side","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu, Sun 8am&#8211;8pm; Fri, Sat 8am&#8211;10pm","Tue&#8211;Thu 11am&#8211;7pm; Fri 11am&#8211;10pm; Sat 10am&#8211;10pm; Sun 10am&#8211;4pm","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu 8am&#8211;10pm; Fri 8am&#8211;midnight; Sat 10am&#8211;midnight; Sun 10am&#8211;8pm","","","","","","","","5004","296 City Island Ave","","","","","","","156 E 64th Street between Third and Lexington Aves","220 E 81st St between Second and Third Aves ","","","","","","","102 W 73rd St at Columbus Ave","Alice&#146;s Tea Cup","Alice&#146;s City Island (CLOSED)","","","","","","","Alice's Tea Cup Chapter II ","Alice&#146;s Tea Cup","","","","","","","","212-799-3006","(718-885-0808","","","","","","","212-486-9200","212-734-4832","","","","","","","Alice&#146;s vanilla cr&egrave;me anglaise ($9)","Average main course: $8","","","","","","","Average sandwich: $8","","","","","","","","Caf&eacute;s & diners","","Subway: B, C, 1, 2, 3 to 72nd St","6 Travel: 6 to Pelham Bay Park, then take the Bx29 bus to City Island","","","","","","","Subway: F to Lexington Ave&#8211;63rd St","","","","","","","","","","rr ED05 Joanne Chen","x","4/28/2004","212-799-3006","Raw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit inFact check in","","10023-3047","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","AlicesTeaCup","","ED","","yes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.alicesteacup.com",""

"","","","","",""," True, Otto&#146;s train station&#8211;themed name board (you get your table when your &#147;city&#148; comes up) will inspire eye-rolling&#151;as will the lengthy wait if you fail to make a reservation. The Otto team can get away with it, though, because the food lives up to its rep. Italian cheeses come with such condiments as apricot mostarda or black-truffle honey. The weakest link might be the restaurant&#146;s centerpiece, the individual-sized pizzas. Toppings are terrific, but the crust can be a bit limp. Still, at about $13 a pie and with everything else so perfect, it&#146;s hard to complain.","Good for large groupsTrendyNotable chefNotable wine listTakeoutDeliveryFull barNo steps at entranceWheelchair accessible bathroomNYCVisit: Power brokerNYCVisit: RomanticNYCVisit: TrendsetterNYCVisit: Culture buffKid-friendly","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","yes","","Greenwich Village","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Daily 11:30am&#8211;midnight","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5684","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1 Fifth Ave at 8th St","Otto Enoteca Pizzeria","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-995-9559","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Italian: Pizza ","","Subway: A, C, E, B, D, F, V to W 4th St; N, R, W to 8th St&#8211;NYU","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Erin Meister (E&D 2008)","x","5/26/2004","212-995-9559","Raw review inFact check inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit in","Over 700 regional Italian wines","10003-4312 ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","OttoEnotecaPizzeria","Delivery in neighborhood only","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.ottopizzeria.com",""

"","","","","","","Australia may be the only nation as fond of supersizing as ours. So it&#146;s no wonder that Down Under eatery Sunburnt Cow&#146;s hefty burger ($9) is so tall it&#146;s probably easier to attack sideways. They do things differently down there, so along with lettuce, tomato and cheese, this whopper is piled with bacon, fried egg, beet, and pineapple&#8211;a.k.a. &#147;the Lot&#148;&#8211;and thus tastes like a cross between a meat loaf and a tropical salad.

Pay special attention to dishes centering on eggplant (at its peak through early fall) and lamb: We were floored by the shushbarak ($18), lamb ravioli cooked in a mint-garlic-yogurt sauce and served with vermicelli and rice ($18), and the eggplant napoleon ($6.50), baba ghanoush sandwiched between tender crisp-fried aubergine disks and topped with chopped tomato-basil salad. The secret to Bishara&#146;s cooking lies in imported, fresh ground spices, which she sprinkles over her dishes with a doting mother&#146;s care.","TakeoutDeliveryKid-friendlyVegetarian-friendlySolo diningBYOBCateringWheelchair accessible bathroom","AmEx, DC, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","","","Brooklyn: Bay Ridge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tue&#8211;Sun 10:30am&#8211;10:30pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6117","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7704 Third Ave between 77th and 78th Sts","Tanoreen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","718-748-5600","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Middle Eastern","","Subway: R to 77th St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","x","4/10/2004","718-748-5600","Raw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit inFact check inReady to galley","","11209-3002","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","Tanoreen","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dish (7.50) is strikingly fresh, full of flavor, and the essence of what this kid favorite should be. Chewy rice noodles, substantial shrimp that are actually worth sinking your teeth into, matchsticks of tofu, scrambles of egg and the requisite bean sprout-peanut-lime wedge combo are brought together in the four-part harmony of spicy, sweet, salty and sour that makes authentic Thai cuisine a thrill.","No steps at entranceGarden seatingGood for large groupsConversation-friendlyBYOBKid-friendlyTakeoutVegetarian-friendlyWheelchair accessible bathroomNYCVisit: ExplorerNYCVisit: TrendsetterNYCVisit: Family","Cash only","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Queens, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","yes","","Queens: Woodside","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon, Tue, Thu&#8211;Sun 11:30am&#8211;10pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6236","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","64-13 39th Ave between 64th and 65th Sts","Sripraphai","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","718-899-9599","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Thai","","Subway: 7 to 61st St&#8211;Woodside","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","yes","uu","x","5/18/2004","718-899-9599","Fact check inRaw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit in","","11377-2846","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","Sripraphai","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The innovative children&#146;s menu includes pork kebab with Cypriot fries ($9).

"","","","","","","By night, Landmarc is the perfect mommy-and-daddy destination featuring elegant interiors, robust dishes and a kilelr wine list. By day, however, it&#146;s very kid-friendly, with wipeable wood tables, a kids&#146; menu and several types of juice by the glass. While children have lots of choices, ranging from veggie sticks with peanut butter to a bowl of Cheerios, those with more adult tastes get the most out of their meals. Chef Marc Murphy&#146;s menu offers bistro favorites like fris&eacute;e aux lardons, duck confit, and moules frites. Daytime fare is a bit lighter, and includes traditional sandwiches like croque-monsieurs and pain bagnat. No matter what time you go, dessert is a must.","Outdoor seatingTakeoutVegetarian-friendlyWheelchair accessible bathroomNo steps at entranceGood for large groupsDeliveryFull barPower mealsNotable chefConversation-friendlyKid-friendly","AmEx, DC, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","yes","","Tribeca","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Fri noon&#8211;2am; Sat, Sun 11am&#8211;2am","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6405","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","179 West Broadway between Leonard and Worth Sts","Landmarc Tribeca","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-343-3883","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Eclectic","","Subway: 1 to Franklin St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","yes","E&D Heather Tierney (paid)","x","7/15/2004","212-343-3883","Fact check inReady to galleyCopy edit inFirst edit inFinal edit inRaw review in","","10013-2921 ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","LandmarcTribeca","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.landmarc-restaurant.com",""

"","","","","","","Make-your-own-pizza parties have been a big hit here since Pinch&#146;s 2003 opening. Each kid gets a section of a three-foot-long pie to decorate, choosing from a list of 25 toppings. Children can take the traditional route, simply using pepperoni, for instance&#151;or be mad scientists, piling on spinach, sweet sausage and roasted garlic. At party time or dinnertime, Pinch believes in freedom of choice. In fact, you can order your pie in lengths of 4, 12 or 36 inches, with a different topping every four inches.","TakeoutGood for large groupsVegetarian-friendlyKid-friendlyDeliveryCateringWine & beer onlyWheelchair accessible bathroomCheap eatsSolo dining","AmEx, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Gramercy/Flatiron","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Fri 11am&#8211;11pm; Sat noon&#8211;11pm; Sun noon&#8211;10pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6511","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","416 Park Ave South between 28th and 29th St","Pinch&#8211;Pizza by the Inch","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-686-5222","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Italian: Pizza ","","Subway: 6 to 28th St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","nn ED05 Mark Sinclair","x","7/6/2004","212-686-5222","Fact check inReady to galley","","10016-8407","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","Pinch&#8211;PizzabytheInch","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.pinchandsmac.com",""

The long gray counter is decorated with, among other colorful tchotchkes, a Homer Simpson figurine. Kids&#151;and their parents&#151;will appreciate old-school video games like Pac-Man and Galaga. And as cartoons play on plasma TVs above the counter, happy patrons can order a thick-and-creamy malted, a hot dog or a hot fudge sundae. Mmm...rainbow sprinkles.

"","","","","","","If you like your pork ribs smoked-rubbed, head to this biker joint on Harlem&#146;s far west side. Call ahead to reserve a table, or be prepared for up to a two-hour wait (always fun with little ones). On a typical Saturday night, the front sidewalk is crowded with hungry patrons and rows of Harleys. In addition to killer versions of ribs and pulled pork, Dinosaur offers superior sides, like delicate fried green tomatoes and Syracuse salt potatoes (boiled, then sauced with garlic and butter). Bonus points for the temporary T. rex tattoos offered to the whole family.","High chairsBooster seatsOutdoor seatingTakeoutDeliveryCateringFull barDining at barNo steps at entranceWheelchair accessible bathroom","AmEx, DC, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","New York, NY","","","Columbia University&#8211;City College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu 11:30am&#8211;11pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6735","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","646 W 131st St between Broadway and Twelfth Ave","Dinosaur Bar-B-Que","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-694-1777","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Barbeque","","Subway: 1 to 125th St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY 524 eat adds","","","212-694-1777","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","DinosaurBarBQue","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.dinosaurbarbque.com",""

Extras include salads, crispy onion rings and refreshing smoothies like the Berry Extreme, a zingy combo of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, cranberry and orange juices, and vanilla ice cream. A second location sits a bit to the west (678 Sixth Ave between 21st and 22nd Sts; 212-229-1404).

(Righteous Urban Barbecue) seems unusually authentic, there&#146;s a reason why: Paul Kirk, a Kansas City legend who&#146;s won hundreds of awards and authored several books on smoking and grilling, designed all the recipes and menu contents. The result is pure pig heaven. Head chef Scott Smith slow-smokes pastrami for 14 hours and serves &#147;burnt ends&#148;&#151;brisket that&#146;s smoked twice and cooked well-done.

Friendly, Fifties-chandeliered POP Diner features the usual breakfasts, burgers, sundaes and midnight espressos. But unlike most diners, it takes its food seriously, confidently turning out generous, creative dishes. Seafood is a particular strength, accounting for tender fried calamari and meaty Maryland crabcakes. Seafood risotto, bursting with fresh, saffron-kissed squid and shellfish, is as expertly cooked as a fancy paella. And on a recent visit a savory T-bone steak arrived rare as requested, a rare occurrence. Quality touches are everywhere&#151;house-baked challah rolls, daquiris made with fresh berries, entr&eacute;e-accompanying soups as thick as stews. And, for once in a diner, the homemade desserts taste as good as they look. (The cheesecake tastes even better.) POP Diner does many things well, but it&#146;s best at making you think you&#146;re dining in a fine restaurant.","","718-426-2229","Fact check inRaw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inCopy edit inReady to galley","","11373-3749","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","PopDiner","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Very afraid. Because once people get a taste of Angon, no one&#146;s going to settle for what the other places have to offer. The wonders begin the minute you step inside. Not a tacky garish chili-pepper light anywhere. Milton TK, a host and co-owner, is an attentive, gregarious water-filler; the only thing more sparkling than his vest is his smile. The star is the chef: Mina TK, who Milton claims is the first female chef among the Indian restaurants on 6th Street, has quite the cult following. On one visit, we discovered several diners were fans who had followed the Chowhound darling from Mina&#146;s Foods in Queens to this location. And for good reason. There is virtually no flat dish on the menu. Aloo tikka (deep-fried potato balls) has a remarkably even breading and an unusually rich creaminess. Samosa chat was virtually unrecognizable, covered in a yogurt sauce packed with more herbs and flavors than we could ever guess at. The caramelized onions on top of the khichuri (lentil and rice) made the dish a tad sweet but it all became a nice foil for the spicy chicken curry on the side. Dal fry, the house specialty of fried and baked lentils, was truly spectacular and complexly flavored, though you wouldn&#146;t have known by the way one server described it: It&#146;s just some lentils with turmeric, onion, garlic, ginger and cilantro. There are probably some secret ingredients he left out. No matter. We&#146;ll just enjoy Mina&#146;s magic touch&#151;and pity the other restaurants.","","212-260-8229","Raw review inFirst edit inFinal edit inFact check inCopy edit in","","10003","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","AngonontheSixth","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.angon.biz",""

Tucked on a quiet side street, this cozy and unpretentious spot charms with brown-paper covered tables and menus held together with wooden spoons. To satisfy any hunger that might develop while working through the impressive list of 70 Italian wines&#151;with nightly vino specials added&#151;D.O.C also serves up a host of palate-pleasing small plates, all perfect for sharing. A mouthwatering assortment of cheeses can be ordered individually and also come in cheese and cold cut platters. The vegetarian carpaccio is served as a heaping mound of thin, perfectly rolled slices of carrot and zucchini topped with a generous dose of parmesan shavings. An assortment of pistokku&#151;traditional flatbread from the region of Sardinia&#151;are served pizza style, warm and crispy with toppings such as bresaola (air cured beef), goat cheese and argula. The only disappointment of the evening was a mealy fregola pasta with proscuitto and a bland gorgonzola cream sauce, but that was quickly overshadowed by a ricotta mousse with chocolate chips and fresh strawberries. And, of course, another glass of wine.","","718-963-1925","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","DOCWineBar","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"","","","","","","Get over hating Whole Foods, because this chain simply has one of the city&#146;s best buffets. Your family may have to scramble for a seat, especially at the packed Columbus Circle location, but $7.99/pound lets you sample literally dozens of globally inspired dishes. The steamed kale is piquant and brilliant green, and there&#146;s no better place to introduce children to unusual grains (wheat berries, quinoa, kasha). Constant crowds ensure that the food is replenished frequently, so your lasagna never has the dry edges that plaque 24-hour deli bars.","Vegetarian-friendlyTakeoutCateringDelivery","AmEx, DC, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","AmEx, Disc, MC, V","AmEx, DC, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","Gramercy/Flatiron","Lower East Side","","","","","","","Tribeca","Upper West Side","","","","","","","Daily 8am&#8211;10pm","","","","","","","","Daily 8am&#8211;11pm","Daily 8am&#8211;11pm; Wine store: Mon&#8211;Sat 9am&#8211;10pm, Sun noon&#8211;9pm","","","","","","","7130","95 E Houston St between Bowery and Chrystie St","","","","","","","270 Greenwich St at Warren St","808 Columbus Ave at 97th St","","","","","","","40 E 14th St between Broadway and University Pl ","Whole Foods Market Union Square","Whole Foods Market ","","","","","","","Whole Foods Market","Whole Foods Market Upper West Side","","","","","","","","212-673-5388","212-420-1320","","","","","","","212-349-6555","212-222-6160","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Food or Beverage Shop","","Subway: L to First Ave; N, Q, R, W, 4, 5, 6 to 14th St&#8211;Union Sq","Subway: F, V to Second Ave&#8211;Lower East Side","","","","","","","Subway: 1, 2, 3 to Chambers St","Subway: 1, 2, 3 to 96th St","","","","","","","","","","","","212-673-5388","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","WholeFoodsMarketUnionSquare","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.wholefoodsmarket.com",""

"","","","","","","Among the faded storefronts on Amsterdam Avenue, this spot boldly announces itself, courtesy of its blue neon sign. But it also attracts attention for the namesake flatbread wraps that dominate its small menu. Similar to kathi rolls (kebab-stuffed Indian bread), these savory frankies are filled with ingredients like spiced egg, chicken and lamb and are topped with yogurt-and-cilantro sauce. You can get them to go, but the potato-filled ones feel like they weigh seven pounds each, so eat them at the counter if you&#146;ve got kids in tow.","TakeoutCateringKid-friendlyVegetarian-friendly","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Upper West Side","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Daily 11am&#8211;2am","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7140","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","994 Amsterdam Ave at 110th St","Bombay Frankie","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-666-1500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Indian","","Subway: 1 to 110th St&#8211;Cathedral Pkwy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-666-1500","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","BombayFrankie","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.bombayfrankie.com",""

"","","","","","","Yes, Telepan is a fancy, expensive restaurant. But it&#146;s also on the Upper West Side, and thusly is equipped to handle children. Chef Bill Telepan (JUdson Grill, Bar Americain) mixes high-end ingredients with low-end recipes and vice versa. Whether high or low, the quality of Telepan&#146;s ingredients and power of his culinary imagination is exceptional. Case in point: The killer carrot-cake sundae features cream-cheese ice cream and sugar-sweet Day-Glo carrot shavings. Although the place is upscale, the vibe is casual, and the servers are good-natured and knowledgeable. It feels like a friend&#146;s apartment&#151;filled with a bunch of Upper West Side moms and dads&#151;only this friend can cook.","Kid-friendlyNYCVisit: Culture buffNYCVisit: ExplorerNYCVisit: FamilyNYCVisit: TrendsetterNYCVisit: Glamour houndNYCVisit: Power brokerNYCVisit: RomanticBYOBBrunchConversation-friendlyDining at barFull barNo steps at entranceNotable chefPretheaterReservations requiredSolo diningTakeoutVegetarian-friendlyWheelchair accessible bathroom","AmEx, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","yes","","Upper West Side","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon, Tue 5&#8211;11pm;Wed, Thu 11:30am&#8211;2:30pm, 5&#8211;11pm; Fri, Sat 11:30am&#8211;2:30pm, 5&#8211;11:30pm; Sun 11am&#8211;2:30pm, 5&#8211;10:30pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7190","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","72 W 69th St at Columbus Ave ","Telepan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-580-4300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American: $25 and up","Recently Reviewed","Subway: B, C to 72nd St; 1 to 66th St&#8211;Lincoln Ctr","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY 541 MR&#151;Randall Lane","","2/3/2006","212-580-4300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$$","Telepan","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.telepan-ny.com",""

"","","","","","","When the Japanese cream-puff franchises moved in, we knew it was only a matter of time before the grill-it-yourself megachain Gyu-Kaku turned up, too. Here and at the midtown location (805 Third Ave at 50th St; 212-702-8816), meat lovers savor yakiniku standards, including kalbi (short ribs) and harami miso (skirt steak), along with more esoteric cuts like bite-size kobe kalbi. There&#146;s even a way to get your kids to eat their greens: A platter of foil-encased vegetables is like a tray of little gifts waiting to be unwrapped.","High chairsBooster seatsWine & beer onlyFull barVegetarian-friendlyNo steps at entranceWheelchair accessible bathroomDining at barSeparate bar menuPrivate roomsGood for large groupsKid-friendly","AmEx, Disc, MC, V","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","East Village","Midtown East","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu 6pm&#8211;midnight; Fri, Sat 6pm&#8211;1am; Sun 6&#8211;11pm","Mon&#8211;Thu 6pm&#8211;midnight; Fri, Sat 6pm&#8211;1am; Sun 6&#8211;11pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7210","805 Third Ave between 49th and 50th Sts, second floor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","34 Cooper Sq between 5th and 6th Sts","Gyu-kaku","Gyu&#8211;kaku","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-475-2989","212-702-8816","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Japanese","","Subway: L to Third Ave; 6 to Astor Pl","Subway: E, V to Lexington Ave&#8211;53rd St; 6 to 51st St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY 507 Maile Carpenter","","6/16/2005","212-475-2989","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","Gyukaku","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.gyu-kaku.com",""

But there&#146;s also a savory version&#151;a dense, fist-size ball made with yuca flour, along with beef and chicken empanadas and delicious little corn cakes. If the kids want something familiar, the grilled sandwiches (&#147;booty-press specials&#148;) come with a choice of guava jelly or banana and Fluff, pressed between thick slices of bread.","","Cash only","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chelsea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8am&#8211;9pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7267","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","261 W 23rd St between Seventh and Eighth Aves","Big Booty Bread Co","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-414-3056","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Caf&eacute;s & diners","","Subway: C, E, 1 to 23rd St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","E&D Elisabeth Vincentelli (paid)","","","212-414-3056","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","BigBootyBreadCo","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.bigbootybreadco.com",""

Purists beware: At Ziggiz, the cheese steaks are automatically made with provolone, so you have to specify Whiz if you want an authentic Philly version. Otherwise, the sandwich sticks to the rules, with top-notch Angus and buns shipped in from Atlantic City. Brothers George and Steve Zamfotis, who also run a casual lunch spot, have hedged their bets by stocking the menu with kid-friendly burgers and burritos.","Garden seatingGood for large groupsDeliveryTakeoutDining at barNo steps at entrance24 hoursDessert placeBYOBBreakfastWheelchair accessible bathroomLate night","AmEx, MC, V ($10 minimum)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Gramercy/Flatiron","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Daily 24hrs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7285","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","333 Third Ave between 24th and 25th Sts ","Ziggiz","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-683-3663","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American: $15 and less","","Subway: 6 to 23rd St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-683-3663","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","Ziggiz","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"","","","","","","The last time you toured Italy, your bambino was just a zygote. Relive the culinary highlights at this stylish yet casual Upper West Side spot, where your honeymoon baby can snooze in his stroller right by your table in the double-wide aisle. Each of Italy&#146;s 20 regions is represented by at least one dish on the menu of small plates, pastas and entr&eacute;es. Expect thick meat rag&ugrave;, spicy fish stew, and classics like cavatelli with broccoli rabe, sweet sausage and dried chili. Toddlers will delight in the exotic-sounding cjalzun ampezzani: beet-and-ricotta ravioli in a simple thyme-butter sauce. The creamy beet filling is not only high in folate but also a lovely shade of hot pink. The management may hate us for saying so, but with its easygoing staff, cry-cloaking noise level and good selection of Italian wines by the glass, Regional is a parent&#146;s dream.&#151;Maureen Shelly","Good for large groupsTakeoutDining at barFull barKid-friendlyNo steps at entranceWheelchair accessible bathroomRestaurant Week participantBar sceneDessert placeBrunch","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Upper West Side","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Wed 5&#8211;11pm; Thu, Fri5&#8211;11:30pm; Sat 11am&#8211;3:30pm,5&#8211;11:30pm; Sun 11am&#8211;3:30pm, 5&#8211;10:30pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7286","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2607 Broadway between 98th and 99th Sts ","Regional","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-666-1915","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average man course: $18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Italian: $16-24","","Subway: 1, 2, 3 to 96th St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY 515 NR James Oliver Cury","","8/11/2005","212-666-1915","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","Regional","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.regionalnyc.com",""

"","","","","","","Comfort food goes high-concept at this Nolita eatery, but your kids won&#146;t be intimidated&#151;thanks to an inviting atmosphere and friendly service, they&#146;ll probably even feel right at home. Meat loaf, fried chicken and PB&J all make an appearance on the menu, and many old-fashioned dishes get a playful, modern update.

"","","","","","","Since opening its doors in 2005, this joint has become a hit with Main Street&#146;s young&#146;uns who like their burgers and fries served straight up, with no plastic toys. Joe&#146;s marries a classic fast-food menu familiar to anyone who&#146;s made a pit stop on I-95 with a teen-centric atmosphere (plasma-screen TVs hang on the walls; XM Satellite radio pumps in tunes). And unlike that roadside Hardee&#146;s, Joe&#146;s cooks each order fresh. The burgers are topped with crisp lettuce, tomatoes with actual flavor (!), Joe&#146;s special Thousand Island&#8211;esque sauce, and (if you like) grilled or raw onions.<a href='http://newyorkkids.timeout.com/articles/restaurants/10324/joes-best-burger'>Click here</a>","","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Queens, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Queens: Flushing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10:30am&#8211;10pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7596","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","39-11 Main St at Roosevelt Ave","Joe&#146;s BestBurger","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","718-445-8065","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American: $15 and less","","Subway: 7 to Flushing&#8211;Main St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY RO 530","","11/18/2005","718-445-8065","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","JoesBestBurger","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.joesbestburger.com",""

At the bar, sample his famous cheesecake lollipops (though beware, they melt quickly) or any of Burke&#146;s 18 flavored (calorie-free) sprays; they&#146;re available as condiments, or you can take a bottle home for $4.50.

"","","","","","","This 10,000-square-foot space is full of quirky aquatic touches that keep kids distracted, such as oversize fish tanks and flat-screen monitors playing underwater scenes. The menu contains a few comfort-food offerings like spareribs and mac and cheese, but the main draws come from the sea: plump steamed mussels in a creamy, spicy coconut-curry broth with cilantro and red peppers, and whole trout stuffed with sweet crabmeat. Aside from being tasty, the portions are enormous and the prices affordable. And although the fare is upscale and the dress code is formal, the vibe here is more family-friendly than stuffy.","Kid-friendly","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Harlem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Daily 11am&#8211;1am","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7813","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2110 Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Blvd (Seventh Ave) between 125th and 126th Sts","Pier 2110 (CLOSED)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-280-7437","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Seafood","","Subway: 2, 3 to 125th St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY 565 NR&#151;Leslie Price","","7/21/2006","212-280-7437","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","expensive","Pier2110(CLOSED","","ED","yes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"","","","","","","Most New Yorkers know to avoid eating in Times Square, but this 3,500-square-foot restaurant-arcade may lure you in. If you can pry your child away from the profusion of kid amusements (highlights include simulated race cars and Skee-Ball), you&#146;ll find a full menu of massive entr&eacute;es to sate your family&#146;s appetites. Tots can grab a juicy burger with fries, chicken fingers, grilled cheese or pasta off the kids&#146; menu, then delve into the hot sugared doughnut holes with raspberry and chocolate dipping sauces. Parents should try the Cajun shrimp Alfredo or blackened-chicken pasta, and maybe dip into the ginormous drinks bible.","Booster seatsHigh chairsChanging tablesKid-friendly","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Midtown West","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu, Sun 11am&#8211;midnight; Fri, Sat 11am&#8211;2am","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7854","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","234 W 42nd St between Seventh and Eighth Aves","Dave & Buster&#146;s","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","646-495-2015","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average kids&#146; meal: $7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American: $15 and less","Recently opened","Subway: N, Q, R, W, 42nd St S, 1, 2, 3, 7 to 42nd St&#8211;Times Sq","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY 548&#151;Leslie Price","","3/27/2006","646-495-2015","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","DaveBusters","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.daveandbusters.com",""

"","","","","","","Those in search of a healthy meal can stop reading right now: Even the veggies (like broccoli, asparagus, string beans and okra) are coated in butter. But caloric concerns aside, the soul food served here is among the best on the Upper West Side, and portions of the artery-clogging stuff are more than generous. Kids can choose from downsized versions of the regular menu&#146;s fried catfish strips, pulled pork, fried chicken and baby back ribs. Every entr&eacute;e arrives with a choice of two sides, such as sweet candied yams and gooey macaroni and cheese. Save room for dessert: Enormous slices of homemade coconut-pineapple and red velvet cakes are worth forfeiting the last few savory bites of your main course.","High chairsBooster seatsChanging tables","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Upper West Side","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu 11am&#8211;10pm; Fri, Sat 11am&#8211;11:30pm; Sun 11am&#8211;9:30pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7864","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","258 W 109th St at Broadway","Rack & Soul","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-222-4800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average kids&#146; meal: $5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American Regional","Recently Reviewed","Subway: 1 to 110th St&#8211;Cathedral Pkwy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY 558 NR&#151;Jay Cheshes","","6/2/2006","212-222-4800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","RackSoul","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.rackandsoul.com",""

"","","","","","","Got a kid going through a serious chicken-finger phase? At this buzzed-about takeout and delivery place, chicken (all free-range and organic) is the star&#151;and rightly so. The tiny open kitchen churns out brined, double-battered, deep-fried chicken that&#146;s moist inside and dark brown outside, cooked until it&#146;s crisp. A lonely-looking rotisserie in back serves up a less fatty option for those who want it, and there&#146;s always a veggie-of-the-day among the Southern-inspired sides.

The restaurant doesn&#146;t outdo nearby Pearl&#146;s or Mary&#146;s on the shellfish front, but it holds its own with the $29 lobster roll, a mound of luscious chopped meat mixed with scallions, tarragon and aioli and served on a soft roll with a side of sweet-potato chips.","High chairsBooster seatsKid-friendly","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","West Village","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Daily 7am&#8211;2am","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7897","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","29 Bedford St at Downing St ","Ditch Plains","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-633-0202","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Seafood","Recently Reviewed","Subway: A, C, E, B, D, F, V to W 4th St; 1 to Houston St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY 560 MR&#151;Randall Lane","","6/20/2006","212-633-0202","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","DitchPlains","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.ditch-plains.com",""
"","","","","","","This French addition to the otherwise unexceptional stretch of Columbus Avenue between 81st and 86th Streets does enoughthings well to make it stand out. The decor is standard bistro&#151;diners are surrounded by distressed mirrors and vintage ads. And the menu follows suit, listing all the expected staples: escargots, steak tartare, foie gras, steak frites. Although there&#146;s not much on the menu for young tykes, older children can choose from nonintimidating items like a meaty sirloin burger with fries. A $15 prix-fixe brunch, served Saturdays and Sundays until 3pm, is predictably packed.","Kid-friendly","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Upper West Side","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Sat 5&#8211;11pm; Sun 11am&#8211;3pm, 5&#8211;11pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7898","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","473 Columbus Ave between 82nd and 83rd Sts","Bistro Citron","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-400-9401","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","French: $16-24","Recently Reviewed","Subway: B, C to 81st St&#8211;Museum of Natural History","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY 561 NR&#151;James Oliver Cury","","6/23/2006","212-400-9401","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","BistroCitron","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.bistrocitronnyc.com",""

"","","","","","","Husband-and-wife team Caesar and Sarita Ekya turn out 12 varieties of mac and cheese that range from simple all-American (mild enough for picky pre-K types) to a more complex dish&#151;with Brie, roasted figs and shiitakes, or mac and La Mancha with fennel and shallots. There&#146;s a size for everyone: &#147;nosh&#148; (great for kids), &#147;major munch&#148; (a hearty adult serving) and &#147;mongo&#148; (if you want leftovers). A generous &#147;partay!&#148; size serves eight to 12 lucky folks. Children are offered a regular bowl in lieu of the sizzling skillet in which meals are typically served. The line can be frustratingly long, but for M&C fans, the food is worth the wait.

"","","","","","","Father-and-son team Harry and Peter Poulakakos knew what they were doing when they opened this family-welcoming, 24-hour diner in an unusual location--the desolate-at-night Financial District. With its neon signs and leather-and-vinyl banquettes in primary colors, it looks like something you&#146;d stumble upon in Times Square. Its kitchen-sink-type menu is clearly designed to appeal to a diverse set. Kids and adults alike should relish an appetizer of truffled mac and cheese. Then, dig into a hefty, decadent ice cream sandwich made with soft chocolate-chip cookies and creamy vanilla ice cream. Haute cuisine it&#146;s not, but everyone from families to college kids to tourists looking for a pit stop will find something appealing here.","Good for large groupsTakeoutBar sceneKid-friendlySolo diningFull barVegetarian-friendlyNo steps at entranceWheelchair accessible bathroom","AmEx, DC, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Financial District","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Fri 11am&#8211;3am; Sat, Sun 9am&#8211;3am","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8164","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2 Gold St between Maiden Ln and Platt St","Gold St (CLOSED)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-747-0797","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average kids&#146; meal: $4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Caf&eacute;s & diners","","Subway: A, C to Broadway&#8211;Nassau St; 4, 5 to Fulton St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY 603 JO &#151; Jordana Rothman","","","212-747-0797","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GoldSt(CLOSED","","ED","yes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"","","","","","","Park Slope&#146;s recent addition, the NoNO Kitchen (that&#146;s North of New Orleans to you), offers roasted alligator sausage with a zippy splash of Creole mustard sauce. The spicy dish ($7), served up by chef Gregory Tatis, a disciple of Nawlins culinary legend Paul Prudhomme, tastes suspiciously like...well, sausage. The spicy meat finds its complement in the restaurant&#146;s crunchy crawfish popcorn, crusty-top macaroni and cheese, and buttery candied yams, which are all likely candidates for NoNO&#146;s new kids&#146; menu coming this spring.","","AmEx, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn: Park Slope","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Wed noon&#8211;10pm; Thu noon&#8211;11pm; Fri noon&#8211;midnight; Sat 10am&#8211;midnight; Sun 10am&#8211;10pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8216","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","293 Seventh Ave between 7th and 8th Sts","NoNO Kitchen (CLOSED)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","718-369-8348","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American Regional","","Subway: F, G to Seventh Ave","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY 590 NR&#151;Gabriella Gershenson","","1/12/2007","718-369-8348","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","mid-priced","NoNOKitchen(CLOSED","","ED","yes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"","","","","","","All too often, NYC hotel restaurants have a haughty vibe and cuisine to match. Not so at Fireside, a new eatery from chef Sam DeMarco (First, Merge, District) inside the Omni Berkshire Place. The open, airy space, which seats 80, is decorated with red leather booths and large Lucite boxes meant to serve as hanging fireplaces (pending approval from the New York City fire marshal). The restaurant is open for breakfast (&aacute; la carte and buffet), lunch and dinner seven days a week. Adults can nosh on playful New American dishes such as foie gras candy apples, short-rib tacos, escargot profiteroles, pizzette and barbecued-pork &#147;osso buco,&#148; as well as black and white chocolate mousse cake for dessert; children can choose from a kids&#146; menu that includes chicken bites, crustless grilled cheese and hot chocolate with homemade marshmallows. In keeping with the pyro theme, menus are shaped like oversize matchbooks. Sounds like a hot spot indeed.","","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Midtown East","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Fri 6:30am&#8211;11pm; Sat, Sun 7&#8211;11am, 11:30am&#8211;10pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8246","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","19 E 52nd St at Madison Ave","Fireside","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-754-5017","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American Creative","","Subway: E, V to Lexington Ave&#8211;53rd St; 6 to 51st St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY 589 JO&#151;Leslie Price","","1/5/2007","212-754-5017","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$$","Fireside","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.firesidenewyork.com",""

"","","","","","","This friendly, unassuming restaurant boasts an impeccable pedigree: It&#146;s a collaborative effort from Craig Samuel (City Hall) and Ben Grossman (Picholine). Seating is comfy and simple&#151;bare wooden tables indoors and on a glass-enclosed porch. Most meats are dry-rubbed and all are served alongside a trio of sauces (Jointsmoke, Hollapeno and Brown Sugar&#8211;Chile). The short ribs and pulled pork sandwich are both standouts. For a simple yet seductive surprise, try the iceberg wedge served with chunky blue-cheese dressing; it&#146;ll tempt you to lick the plate&#151;really.","High chairs","AmEx, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn: Fort Greene","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Daily noon&#8211;10pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8269","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","87 South Elliott Pl between Fulton St and Lafayette Ave","The Smoke Joint","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","718-797-1011","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Barbeque","","Subway: C to Lafayette Ave; G to Fulton St; B, M, Q, R to DeKalb Ave","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY 583 MR&#151;Randall Lane","","11/27/2006","718-797-1011","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","SmokeJoint","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.thesmokejoint.com",""

Where else are you going to see a so-called 15-bite all-beef hot dog served on a brioche bun with spicy mustard, sweet pickle relish, sauerkraut and onions rings for $15.95? If the menu doesn&#146;t fascinate your little ones, the baseball-themed, wood-paneled space definitely will.

"","","","","","","The pressed sandwiches (or &#147;swiches&#148;) at this lime green mini-cafeteria are twice as good as the panini you&#146;ve been attempting to whip up at home. Humdrum grilled cheese receives unprecedented flavor (and crunch) in the double-decker version made with Gruyere, cheddar and sliced beefsteak tomato on perfectly warmed rye bread. While kids should have no trouble gobbling down any number of the savory options here, our pick for a real treat is the sweet and sticky Memphis, made with peanut butter, sliced bananas and honey on grilled golden-raisin semolina bread. Balance out the sweetness with a bag of potato chips; made on the premises, they have just the right amount of spice and, surprisingly, aren&#146;t greasy.","","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chelsea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Fri 11am&#8211;11pm; Sat, Sun 11am&#8211;10pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8356","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","104 Eighth Ave between 15th and 16th Sts","Swich","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-488-4800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American Creative","","Subway: A, C, E, 1, 2, 3 to 14th St; L to Eighth Ave","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","assign","","","212-488-4800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","Swich","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.swichpressed.com",""

"","","","","","","A roomier version of its West Village namesake (210 W 10th St at Bleecker St, 212-741-7971), this all-American spot serves some of the freshest comfort food in town. The specialties are oh-so-thick milk shakes, juicy cast-iron-cooked turkey burgers and a slew of grilled hot dogs topped with relish, cheese, grilled onions or chili. Kids may beg for the giant Oreo cookies stacked behind the counter, but with a little cajoling you might get them to fill up on healthier fare first. Long, crispy french fries may be replaced with a side of vegetables from the eatery&#146;s signature seasonal market, which features a rotating list of fresh produce, from Brussels sprouts and broccoli to fennel, kale and bok choy.","","AmEx, DC, Disc, MC, V","AmEx, DC, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","East Village","West Village","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Fri 11:30am&#8211;11pm; Sat, Sun 10am&#8211;11pm","Daily 11:30am&#8211;11pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8399","210 W 10th St at Bleecker St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","173 Ave A at 11th St","Westville East","Westville","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-677-2033","212-741-7971","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American: $15 and less","","Subway: L to First Ave; 6 to Astor Pl","Subway: 1 to Christopher St&#8211;Sheridan Sq","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Gabriella Gershenson (E&D 2008)","","2/2/2007","212-677-2033","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","WestvilleEast","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.westvillenyc.com",""

"","","","","","","Designer ingredients elevate this Park Slope doggeria above other fast-food stops. One wall of the petite rectangular space bears a bright blue, orange and yellow hot-dog mural; diners can sit on cheddar-cheese-hued plastic chairs to nosh on a dizzying variety of tube steaks. On offer are six types of dogs, among them the Mutt (all-beef franks with natural casing), the Best-in-Show (grass-fed beef), the Bird Dog (chicken or turkey) and the veggie-friendly Downward-Facing Dog (tofu), as well as a wealth of toppings and three choices of bun. Desserts are decadent, but we think the sweetest thing about this place is the photo collection of rescued canines that lines its walls.","","Cash only","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn: Park Slope","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Daily 11am&#8211;11pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8407","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","351 Fifth Ave between 4th and 5th Sts","Willie&#146;s Dawgs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","718-832-2941","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American: $15 and less","","Subway: F, G, M, R to Fourth Ave&#8211;9th St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY 594 NTW&#151;Alexis Korman","","2/9/2007","718-832-2941","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","WilliesDawgs","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.williesdawgs.com",""

Kids will go for the skewers of traditional choices like lamb and pork. Finger-friendly sides include zucchini-and-corn fritters and french fries with herb salt.

"","","","","","","Winter, surprisingly, is a great time to go to Coney Island. The amusement park may be closed, but lines at the aquarium, open 365 days a year, have dwindled. After a visit, the hearty food in the Russian community of neighboring Brighton Beach makes an ideal end to a chilly day. The menu at Cafe Glechik is a perfect example: the homey Russo-Ukrainian restaurant specializes in pelmeni and vareniki, which are basically Slavic takes on ravioli&#151;and what kid doesn&#146;t like stuffed pasta? The small, wontonlike vareniki can be ordered as a savory entr&eacute;e (a potato-filled version, for instance, comes with mushrooms and onion on top) or as a dessert (we preferred the one stuffed with cherries). Even better, perhaps, is pelmeni Moscow, a very white dish in which ample potato dumplings are doused in a cheese-and-butter sauce, then baked in a crock, creating a thin, yummy crust. Many dishes here come in a crock, like the Odessa stew (beef and potatoes in a rich gravy). Make sure to wash it all down with &#147;compote,&#148; a refreshing drink made of cherries, apples and pears&#151;fishing out the chunks of fruit is part of the fun In a nice touch for grown-ups, the cappuccinos come in a tall glass that reveals elegant, painstakingly poured layers of coffee, milk and froth.

"","","","","","","This classic Brooklyn pizza joint&#151;think no-frills booths with Formica tables, and plenty of delivery and to-go orders&#151;offers an array of menu options from pressed sandwichesto pastas and salads, but pizza is the prime attraction here. Husband-and-wife owners David and Lourdes O&#146;Keefe bill their stellar grilled pizzas (with superthin, chewy crusts and just the slightest bit of char) as &#147;personal size,&#148; though at six slices they&#146;re easily big enough to feed two hungry kids. We liked one with chunks of sweet sausage, grilledred and yellow peppers, onions and cloudsof soft ricotta; the traditional tomato, mozzarella and basil is a good choice for picky eaters.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn: Clinton Hill","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8573","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","214 Court St between Baltic and Warren Sts","LaylaJones","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","718-624-2361","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Italian: Pizza ","","Subway: F, G to Bergen St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","718-624-2361","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LaylaJones","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"","","","","","","We did our best to rule out chains, but when we discovered that some of the city&#146;s top soup spots (including Amy&#146;s Bread, Murray&#146;s Bagels and Park Slope&#146;s Tea Lounge) actually serve Hale and Hearty, we knew we had to include this one&#146;s home base in Chelsea Market. With close to 150 made-on-the-premises soups (about 17 are offered at any given time) and a focus on fresh ingredients&#8211;all the corn they use is shucked by hand, for instance&#8211;even the most devoted repeat customers are bound to find a new variety to try, as we did recently with the spinach-artichoke-cheddar concoction (verdict: superb). Seafood fans, vegans, chowder devotees and chicken-and-vegetable-only tots will all find something to love, and the staff is generous with tastings. At this location, you can get a glimpse into the kitchen that generates the entirety of the company&#146;s production, with 3 million portions last year alone.

"","","","","","","During a torrential downpour, my mother-in-law and I walked into the former Shopsin&#146;s space with my two-year-old son and three-month-old daughter. The host escorted us through the entryway grocery, which offers a variety of prepared foods and gourmet fixings for a home-cooked meal,and into the rustic dining area.Our server found a place to park our double stroller (no eye-rolling, no forcing us to fold it up). At first the menu seems too sophisticated for a toddler, but I found tasty, uncomplicated entr&eacute;es such as baked chicken or a simple piece of cod, plus french fries and hush puppies, to sate the white-food set. The dish that made my heart sing was the gnocchi with short ribs, escarole and Parmesan broth (pictured): Not only would we survive this outing, but I&#146;d also get to eat an adult meal.Because the restaurant was bustling enough to cover up my son&#146;s rising voice and my baby&#146;s tired cries, we braved dessert. The chocolate&#8211;banana bread pudding with bourbon syrup and whipped cream had a pleasing, cakey texture and both looked and tasted divine.We had just about dried off from the rain by the end of the meal. The staff helped us with the stroller and thanked us, with genuine warmth, for coming. Really, it was our pleasure.","NYCVisit: TrendsetterEat Out Award Winner","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","West Village","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu 11:30am&#8211;2:30pm, 5:30&#8211;11pm; Fri 11:30am&#8211;2:30pm, 5:30pm&#8211;midnight; Sat 10am&#8211;2pm, 5:30pm&#8211;midnight; Sun 10am&#8211;2pm, 5&#8211;10pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8761","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","54 Carmine St at Bedford St","Market Table","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-255-2100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American: $16-24","","Subway: A, C, E, B, D, F, V to W 4th St; 1 to Christopher St&#8211;Sheridan Sq","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY NTW 622 - Jordana Rothman","","","212-255-2100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","MarketTable","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.markettablenyc.com",""

"","","","","","","The founders of this Boerum Hill ice cream parlor aim to do more than just sell great frozen treats. They&#146;ve also invested in eco-friendly practices and want to educate consumers on the origins of their sweets. Alexis Miesen and Jennie Dundas, first-time restaurant owners, have recruited fourth-generation ice cream maker Matt White to churn up 16 flavors of superpremium at local Ronnybrook Dairy just for the shop, and they source their chocolate from a cooperative in Ghana. Rounding out the menu is coffee from Dutchess Country purveyor Irving Farm and high-end In Pursuit of Tea brew; pastries, sandwiches and other snacks are in the works, all to be served with biodegradable cutlery. The duo&#146;s shop, built in part with reclaimed lumber, isn&#146;t simply a place to grab a cone: Parents can enjoy indoor seating and free Wi-Fi service, while kids work off their sugar buzz in the play area at the back at the space.","","Cash only","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn: Boerum Hill","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu, Sun 10am&#8211;9pm; Fri, Sat 10am&#8211;10pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8783","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","420 Atlantic Ave between Bond and Nevins Sts","Blue Marble Ice Cream","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","718-858-1100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Food or Beverage Shop","","Subway: F, G to Bergen St; M, R to Court St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY NTW 625 Jordana Rothman assign","","","718-858-1100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","BlueMarbleIceCream","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"","","","","","","The menu reads like an omnivore&#146;s list of favorite foods&#151;fried calamari, lamb schnitzel, seared tuna ni&ccedil;oise salad, ricotta gnocchi, vegetable bibimbap and four cuts of steak&#151;but somehow it works. Families will feel welcome here, and not just because the acoustics drown out even a colicky baby&#146;s wails, or because the menu is loaded with kid fare like mac and cheese and spaghetti and meatballs. We&#146;ll be back for the beer-battered string beans and, for dessert, the Pink Pussy Cat (one of eight sundaes)&#151;an intoxicating mix of red velvet cake, strawberry ice cream, fresh strawberries and whipped cream.<a href='http://newyorkkids.timeout.com/articles/restaurants/28073/the-smith'>Click here</a>","High chairsChanging tablesNYCVisit: TrendsetterNYCVisit: FamilyReservations requiredGood for large groupsTakeoutDining at barKid-friendlySolo diningOutdoor seatingPrivate roomsLively sceneDeliveryFull barTrendyNo steps at entranceWheelchair accessible bathroom","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","East Village","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu 10am&#8211;1am; Fri, Sat 10am&#8211;2am; Sun 10am&#8211;midnight","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8861","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","55 Third Ave between 10th and 11th Sts","The Smith","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-420-9800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American: $16-24","","Subway: L to Third Ave; 6 to Astor Pl","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NR 646 Gabriella Gershenson","","","212-420-9800","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","Smith","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.thesmithnyc.com",""

"","","","","","","Jackson Heights residents have no problem satisfying a dosa craving, a taco jones or a taste for Peruvian rotisserie chicken. But until recently, the area lacked a comfy java joint.Enter Espresso 77. The petite, cheerful spot&#151;four white tables, a dozen blue chairs (plus two window seats), orange walls and a pressed-tin bar&#151;already feels like a neighborhood fixture. On a recent Monday morning, a pair of nannies sat with their charges; soon after, two stroller-wielding moms stopped in. A bulletin board advertises nearby yoga classes, and both a new-mothers&#146; group and a knitting circle regularly meet in the space.The homey menu befits the community vibe. Breakfast treats include moist, crumbly scones from the Heights&#146; Ambrosia Bakery; among the unusual varieties is the pancetta-Gruy&egrave;re, a sweet-salty combo. Velvetty lattes and other barista concoctions made with beans from Ithaca, New York&#146;s Gimme! Coffee provide a refreshingly noncorporate pick-me-up. At lunchtime, a changing roster of homemade soups, panini and wraps round out the offerings; the chicken curry wrap hit just the right balance of creaminess and spice. On weekends the place gets packed, so if your schedule permits, bring the clan by on a weekday and check out the artwork on display: The rotating exhibitions, naturally, highlight the work of locals.&#151;Carolyn Juris","","Cash only","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Queens, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Queens: Jackson Heights","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu 7am&#8211;9pm; Fri 7am&#8211;10pm; Sat, Sun 8am&#8211;10pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8878","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","35-57 77th St between 35th and 37th Aves","Espresso 77","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","718-424-1077","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average scone: $2.50.

"","","","","","","The kosher oasis, founded in 1954, has left its longtime East Village location and resettled in Murray Hill. Steer kids toward old favorites like noodle pudding, supermoist brisket and fruit blintzes with sweet maple syrup, or new options like miniburgers and franks-in-blankets, any of which tots can wash down with a glass of fountain-pulled chocolate soda. The famed deli sandwiches are large enough to split among three children or two adults; they arrive with a basket of rye bread that makes divvying up the house-cured corned beef (superior to the pastrami and salami) as easy as gobbling it down.<a href='http://newyorkkids.timeout.com/articles/restaurants/26772/second-avenue-deli'>Click here</a>","Changing tablesBooster seatsHigh chairsTakeoutDeliveryCateringClassic NYSolo diningKosherBrunchNYCVisit: Culture buffFull barEat Out Award Winner","AmEx, DC, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","New York, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Midtown East","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu, Sun 6am&#8211;midnight; Fri, Sat 6am&#8211;4am","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8888","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","162 E 33rd St between Lexington and Third Aves","2nd Ave Deli","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","212-698-9000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American","","Subway: 6 to 33rd St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY 637.638 NTW Jordana Rothman","","","212-698-9000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","2ndAveDeli","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.2ndavedeli.com",""

"","","","","","","To paraphrase Kermit the Frog, it&#146;s not easy being ecologically responsible. This new Park Slope store can help you get dinner on the table and do your part for the planet. Seasonal, pre-prepped meals include options like roasted pork chops with apples and cider glaze ($30) or crispy fish cakes with lemon aioli and frisee salad ($16), and are made with locally sourced, organic ingredients whenever possible. The dinners, which serve two to three people, are packaged in biodegradable &#147;eco-tainers&#148; that can be returned for composting.","","AmEx, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn: Park Slope","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Fri 7am&#8211;10pm; Sat, Sun 10am&#8211;4pm.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8893","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","370 Fifth Ave between 5th and 6th Sts","Get Fresh Table and Market","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","718-360-8469","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Food or Beverage Shop","","Subway: F, G to Fourth Ave&#8211;9th St; M, R to Union St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY JO 637. 638 Alex Van Buren","","","718-360-8469","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","GetFreshTableandMarket","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WWW.GETFRESHNYC.COM",""

"","","","","","","DUB Pies&#146; second Brooklyn outpost, the Pie Shop is just a block from Prospect Park. Now that spring is here, it&#146;s a boon for family picnics. Like those at the original Columbia Street location, the self-contained meals, a staple in New Zealand and Australia, come with kid-pleasing fillings surrounded by a delectable crust&#151;flaky outside and moist inside. My picky four-year-old gave his &#147;steak mince&#148; (ground beef) pie a suspicious look, turned it over a few times, then dug in with a gusto usually reserved for Halloween candy. The flavorful sausage roll, which resembles an elongated pig-in-a-blanket, was another hit with both of my boys. I preferred the surprisingly sophisticated and creamy vegetarian-curry pie, with the peppery chicken a close second. For dessert, we split a moist Lamington, another Down Under classic&#151;jam-filled sponge cake covered with chocolate icing and shredded coconut.Staffers are friendly&#151;and they pour a great cup of coffee&#151;but since the sunny corner shop has just three small tables, you may prefer to order your pies to go. If so, thoughtful extras include insulated bags to keep them warm, and reheating instructions so that your family can enjoy the treats at home.","","AmEx, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn: Park Slope","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Fri 7am&#8211;10pm; Sat, Sun 8am&#8211;10pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","211 Prospect Park West at 16th St","The Pie Shop","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","718-788-2448","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average pie: $4.50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Australian & New Zealand","","Subway: F, G to 15th St&#8211;Prospect Park","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY NTW 637.638 Jordana Rothman","","","718-788-2448","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","PieShop","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"","","","","","","In the most child-friendly union since Brad and Angelina, the folks behind the erstwhile Pinch (Pizza by the Inch) and the East Village&#146;s S&#146;MAC (Sarita&#146;s Macaroni and Cheese) have joined forces. The result is lacto-carb heaven. Fun fare like pizza topped with hot dogs and cheeseburger-infused macaroni has major kid appeal. Adults will appreciate delectable dishes like S&#146;MAC&#146;s Parisienne, which combines Brie, figs, roasted shiitake mushrooms and fresh rosemary, or a savory pizza with chicken sausage and chorizo.

"","","","","","","The menu at this neighborhood caf&eacute; incorporates as many locally sourced, seasonal and organic ingredients as possible; a bookshelf features the work of area authors. Kids may gravitate toward the peanut butter, banana and honey or Nutella and banana panini, and adults will appreciate the changing selection of salads&#151;particularly the fregola with cucumber, mint, parsley, tomato and pumpkin seeds&#151;and the &#147;Red Neck,&#148; a breakfast wrap with hominy grits, smoked ham, scrambled eggs and farmhouse cheddar. The homemade desserts are crowd-pleasers, especially the triple-chocolate brownies. Almost everything is made on-site, right down to the mayonnaise.<a href='http://newyorkkids.timeout.com/articles/restaurants/67381/ted-honey'>Click here</a>","High chairsKid-friendly","AmEx, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn: Cobble Hill","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tue&#8211;Fri 7:30am&#8211;7pm; Sat, Sun 8am&#8211;6pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8975","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","264 Clinton St at Verandah Pl","Ted & Honey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","718-852-2212","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average kids&#146; sandwich: $4.50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American","","Subway: F, G to Carroll St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","718-852-2212","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","TedHoney","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","tedandhoney.com",""

"","","","","","","Like its neighboring sibling, Sweet Melissa P&acirc;tisserie, the Cr&egrave;merie is a delightful temple of decadence. The Campfire Sundae is a kid-magnet for all seasons: graham crackers, toasted marshmallows, hot fudge and fresh whipped cream atop rich Bassetts ice cream. Grown-ups, when not dipping into their children&#146;s dishes, may opt for a buttery caramel-and-rum-raisin-bread-pudding sundae or the espresso-soaked coffee ice cream garnished with candied lemon peel. Baked goods from the P&acirc;tisserie, such as homemade brownies and Peanut Butter Indulgence (layers of chocolate cake, peanut butter and ganache), make welcome guest appearances in the sundaes. All of these treats, as well as cones, malteds and egg creams, can be ordered to go.<a href='http://newyorkkids.timeout.com/articles/restaurants/40971/sweet-melissa-cremerie'>Click here</a>","High chairs","AmEx, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn: Cobble Hill","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Fri noon&#8211;11pm; Sat, Sun noon&#8211;1am","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9124","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","274 Court St between Butler and Douglass Sts","Sweet Melissa Cr&eacute;merie","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","718-855-3410","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average kids&#146; scoop: $3.50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American: $15 and less","","Subway: F, G to Bergen St","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY NTW 663 Jordana Rothman &#8211; Assign","","","718-855-3410","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","SweetMelissaCremerie","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.sweetmelissapatisserie.com",""

This is apparent from your first bite of the slightly sweet, slightly salty popovers brought to the table in lieu of bread soon after you sit down; similarly, the delicata squash tart appetizer with house-made buttermilk ricotta is a creamy revelation. The attention to culinary detail extends even to the children&#146;s meal, which finishes with a Blue Marble mini-sundae. After 7pm the place is mobbed, but for the two hours before that, you&#146;ll have it to yourselves. The obliging staff won&#146;t bat an eye at your picky eaters, or at tykes who can&#146;t sit still.","High chairsDate placeDessert placeDining at barFull barGood for large groupsKid-friendlyLively sceneNo reservationsNo steps at entranceNotable chefNYCVisit: RomanticNYCVisit: ExplorerVegetarian-friendly","AmEx, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","yes","","Brooklyn: Carroll Gardens","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu, Sun 5&#8211;11pm; Fri, Sat 5pm&#8211;midnight","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","524 Court St at Huntington St","Buttermilk Channel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","718-852-8490","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average kids&#146; meal: $10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American","","Subway: F, G to Smith&#8211;9th Sts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY NTW 687 Daniel Gritzer","","","718-852-8490","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","ButtermilkChannel","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.buttermilkchannelnyc.com",""

"","","","","","","Carefully curated, seasonal fare reminds you what skilled hands can do with top-notch ingredients. This is apparent from your first bite of the slightly sweet, slightly salty popovers brought to the table in lieu of bread soon after you sit down; similarly, the delicata squash tart appetizer with house-made buttermilk ricotta is a creamy revelation. The attention to culinary detail extends even to the children&#146;s meal, which finishes with a Blue Marble mini-sundae. After 7pm the place is mobbed, but for the two hours before that, you&#146;ll have it to yourselves. The obliging staff won&#146;t bat an eye at your picky eaters, or at tykes who can&#146;t sit still.","High chairsDate placeDessert placeDining at barFull barGood for large groupsKid-friendlyLively sceneNo reservationsNo steps at entranceNotable chefNYCVisit: RomanticNYCVisit: ExplorerVegetarian-friendly","AmEx, Disc, MC, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brooklyn, NY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","yes","","Brooklyn: Carroll Gardens","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Thu, Sun 5&#8211;11pm; Fri, Sat 5pm&#8211;midnight","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9947","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","524 Court St at Huntington St","Buttermilk Channel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","718-852-8490","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average kids&#146; meal: $10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","American","","Subway: F, G to Smith&#8211;9th Sts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TONY NTW 687 Daniel Gritzer","","","718-852-8490","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","ButtermilkChannel","","ED","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","www.buttermilkchannelnyc.com",""
