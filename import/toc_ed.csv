The menu balances Japanese classics and fun rolls (we love the wholly untraditional House Crunch). Servers are honest about what's freshest, and every time we go for the yellowtail, the quality is great. Likewise, the creamy scallop nigiri and spicy white tuna roll are unforgettable.

Standards are dressed up with fancy touches like saffron cream, garlic polenta and sun-dried tomato pesto, and it's all executed with competence, but with a little less oomph than the dramatic menu descriptions suggest. Two enormous pork chops arrive tender with plenty of honey flavor but only a trace of the advertised jalape&#241;o.

Well, technically the legendary space is now owned by the Berghoff's daughter, who's added a few modern dishes such as stuffed portabella and herb-crusted tilapia, but the carving station still serves up sandwiches, the bar still pours Berghoff beer and root beer, and the kitchen still slings weiner schnitzel, sauerbraten and the like.","Cheap (entrees under $10)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chicago, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Loop","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lunch, dinner (closed Sun)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1260","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17 W Adams St","17 West at the Berghoff","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","312-427-3170","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $4.50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","German","","El: Blue, Red to Monroe.

This upscale eatery is hidden on the second floor of a nondescript commercial complex, but the eclectic menu (and funky vibe to match) makes this a spot worth seeking out. This is soul food transcended. Start with the crab cakes, and then go for the chipotle ribs or steak. You'd be hard-pressed to find anything elsewhere like chef David Blackmon's signature bayou catfish, a tasty dish of two crispy filets stuffed with Cajun spiced crabmeat on a bed of grilled vegetables.

For nearly two decades, this traditional Japanese spot offers more of a steakhouse atmosphere&#8212;with low lights, jazz tunes and TVs at the bar&#8212;and keeps the focus on food.

Aside from sushi, try the kani su, a salad of cucumbers and meaty pieces of crab in tangy vinegar dressing.

More so than the ice cream, chocolates, or the small menu of soups and sandwiches, it's nostalgia that draws people out in droves. The fancy silver trays with white paper doilies and saucers filled with chocolate and caramel sauces no doubt bring back fond memories for many, whose families have made this place a tradition since it opened in 1921.

But despite the carefully retained details from its former life as a 1904 fire station, we still don't understand why the cedar-planked Dover sole with browned butter, while flavorful, costs $40.99.

The owners are committed to organics and offer meat-free options, but they're okay with a little cheese, butter and sugar every now and then.

This mainstay nails all three.

Lindy's launched its famed chili biz in 1924, and in the mid-'70s, a local entrepreneur purchased both businesses and put them under one roof. The chili is supposedly still made from the original recipe, and it's a tasty one at that. But in the summer, we go for ice cream, which is about as creamy as it gets this side of gelato. Superrich milk shakes and malts are perfect for sipping while reading the framed newspaper clippings from Gertie's golden oldie days.","Kid-friendly","Cash only","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chicago, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Southwest Side","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11am&#8211;9pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1698","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7600 S Pulaski Rd","Gertie's Ice Cream/Lindy's Chili","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","773-582-2510","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average ice-cream cone: $3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ice cream/sweets","","Bus: 53A South Pulaski, 79 79th","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","60652","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","Gertie's Ice Cream/Lindy's Chili","","","","","","","","23","Southwest Side","","","","G","","","Listed","65","","",""

But she hasn't moved far: She recently re-opened at 70 East Oak Street, where there's more room for her crunchy clusters of chocolate and nuts and her decadent baked goods like chocolate-raspberry brioche. She's taken the opportunity to expand her menu to include pressed sandwiches, such as a grilled cheese with truffle oil, and to expand her gelato selection, which now offers flavors such as fresh blueberry.

Grab a booth in the dim, casual, somewhat shabby room (it's not bad, but the place does much more take-out biz) and dig into the flavorful meatballs, tangy tomato sauce and toasted bread that make for one great meatball sandwich. Basic but fresh ingredients are turned into a handful of pastas, like angel-hair with shrimp and spinach ravioli in tomato cream.

If that doesn't do the trick, she has a whole line of imported meats and cheeses, and serves Italian coffee drinks using Lavazza beans.","Cheap (entrees under $10)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chicago, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lincoln Park","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8am&#8211;8pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1843","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2318 N Clark St","Deli Boutique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","773-880-9820","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Delis","","El: Red to Fullerton.

Chef Paul Virant (a 2007 Food & Wine best new chef) marks the start of fall with dishes such as a brined and wood-grilled Gunthrop Farm rack of pork with wild rice, roasted Genesis Growers cauliflower, Hillside Orchards chestnuts and preserved sweet cherries. Of course, the menu changes nearly every week, so there's no telling what'll actually be on the menu when you arrive. Luckily, the Friday and Saturday burger nights (dry-aged beef with housemade pickles and preserved tomatoes) are a constant.","Notable wine listVegetarian-friendlySuburban","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Western Springs, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","Suburbs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dinner (closed Sun)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1883","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4471 Lawn Ave,","Vie","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","708-246-2082","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Contemporary American","","Metra: Burlington/Santa Fe to Western Springs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","60558","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$$","Vie","","","","","","","","27","Suburbs","","","","V","","","Listed","48","","www.vierestaurant.com",""

"","","","","","","A few things to keep in mind while visiting this popular Lincoln Park eatery: The carbonara, made the real way (with an egg and everything!) is excellent; the gnocchi, outsourced from an Italian-grandmother type, is rich and fluffy; and the salsiccia alla calabrese, with soft, sweated peppers and succulent sausage, is a good bet. The wine list is surprisingly decent for a restaurant at this price level. And the rest of the foodÉwell, it passes muster.

But chef-owner Kim Dalton has the chops to keep this breakfast-and-lunch spot alive. She keeps us coming back for the a.m. standbys that got us hooked in the first place: the veggie-packed tofu scramble and the thick Greek yogurt topped with housemade granola and berries. During lunch, Dalton elevates simple, unpretentious food like thick, indulgent ground-beef sandwiches and daily straightforward soups into something special. Her greatest feat, though, is the Japanese pancake, a savory, veggie-stuffed flapjack that actually makes cabbage sound appealing for breakfast.

It's confounding how a tiny storefront lit by one fluorescent bulb and devoid of much charm besides a rug or two decorating the burnt pumpkin&#8211;colored walls could attract such a rabid crowd&#8212;until you taste the food. From the pickled baby artichoke hearts, olives and warm pita plopped on your table as soon as you sit down, to the crevette pil pil's plump shrimp swimming in a light, earthy tomato sauce, to the Sultan's Tagine's falling-off-the-bone braised lamb shank resting on a bed of sweet peas, the exquisite food eclipses the erratic service typical of a just-born restaurant.","Cheap (entrees under $10)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chicago, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lincoln Square","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lunch (Sat, Sun), dinner ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2031","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4749 N Rockwell St","Tagine (CLOSED)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","773-989-4340","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Middle Eastern","Moroccan","El: Brown to Rockwell.

But it's shocking that such a cool-conscious place uses the word japas (Japanese tapas). As it turns out, the joke is on traditionalists: Small plates of dishes such as fresh tofu sprinkled with chile oil and peanuts and prosciutto topped with ponzu sauce, crunchy toasted shallots and charred asparagus make for brilliant, unexpected combinations of flavors.

Luckily, the food doesn't taste like it comes from a chain.

Around lunchtime, a crowd can be found in the lobby ordering their pizza in advance while waiting for one of eighteen tables that are packed into the small building. Each pizza takes at least 45 minutes to cook, but it's worth the wait when the waiter finally arrives with the steaming pan and dishes out your first cheese-heavy slice. If you've got a larger party or just can't stand the wait, head down the street to Pizzeria Due (619 N Wabash Ave), Uno's more spacious sister.

"","","","","","","The name of this joint is meant to make you believe that the food here will be so good you'll sprout wings and fly. That didn't quite happen when we dug in to the simmering plate of loukaneko (hearty Greek sausage) or the smooth, tangy taramasalata, but it nevertheless got our meal off to a good start. Entr&#233;es, on the other hand, we can take or leave. Better to skip the chewy scallops and typical spanakopita and go right from the apps to dessert. Their desserts, baked in-house and brought in from sister restaurant Artopolis Bakery, include the delicious milopita (flaky apple pie spiked with cinnamon and honey).

Having tried most of it, we can say we love starting with the five-spice ribs, the octopus-and-avocado kimchi salad and the crunchy calamari-tangerine salad. Next, we go for the fisherman's stew (it's the miso-lobster chili broth that makes it), the pork chop with thick black-vinegar demi-glace and the peanut-studded panang-beef curry, with an order of edamame stir-fried with pearl onions and cashews.

The fall menu features a spicy pumpkin-and-sweet-corn soup, New Zealand lamb shank with roasted chanterelle mushrooms, and a grilled honey-glazed tuna filet in steamy organic miso broth flanked by carrots and snow peas. For dessert&#8212;the highlight of our last visit&#8212;choices include a pumpkin tart (short-dough crust, caramel sauce, nutmeg-scented whipped cream) and a &#34;blackberry buckle&#34; (streusel topping, cinnamon ice cream, and vanilla and blackberry sauces).","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Geneva, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Suburbs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dinner (Tue&#8211;Sat)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2563","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","14 S Third St,","Niche Restaurant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","630-262-1000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Contemporary American","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","60134","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$","Niche Restaurant","","","","","","","","27","Suburbs","","","","","","","","","","",""

(We're not saying they all ate there, but the owners clearly are fans.) This primarily Spanish-speaking restaurant specializes in the authentic street food of Puebla, the central Mexico town credited as the birthplace of mole poblano. Because Puebla has a large concentration of Lebanese immigrants, you'll find tacos arabes, pork tacos with thick, pitalike wrappers. At Taquer&#237;a Puebla, these chipotle-spiked beauties and their friend the cemita milanesa (a breaded pork steak with cheese and avocado on a sesame-studded bun) are among the best of the menu.","Cheap (entrees under $10)BYOB","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chicago, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Humboldt Park","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lunch, dinner","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2610","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3619 W North Ave","Taquer&#237;a Puebla","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","773-772-8435","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $6.50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mexican","","Bus: 72, 82","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","60647-4724","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","Taquer&#237;a Puebla","","","","","","","","11","Humboldt Park/Logan Square","","","","T","","Humboldt Park/Logan Square","","100","","",""

The dairy kosher kitchen serves up a mock chicken cacciatore on rice or pasta that is large enough for leftovers the next day. The spinach citrus salad is a non-dairy treat, with a wine vinaigrette instead of the standard bacon dressing that ruins so many spinach salads.

Like most theme parks, the focus is more on the experience than the food, a point the weakly executed minestrone and soggy pizza only reinforces. If we were you, we'd take advantage of the hearty lasagna and the extensive wine list. After a glass or two, the decor can get pretty convincing.","Notable wine listVegetarian-friendlyLate-night dining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chicago, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Loop","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lunch, dinner","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2770","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","71 W Monroe St","The Village","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","312-332-7005","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Italian/Pizza","","El: Blue, Red to Monroe; Brown, Green, Orange, Pink, Purple (rush hrs) to Adams.

If you're in the same boat, you'll love this contemporary Mexican spot. If not, it's pretty tough to get past the overpriced menu. Pork-stuffed baby plantains, crabmeat and roasted veggie tamales, and chiles rellenos in Oaxacan-style mole are all delicious starters, but each costs about $12 for two bite-size tastes. For $30 the grilled venison with a yucca blue cheese mash and Sam Adams beer mole sauce is great quality and a hefty portion, but for $18, we expected the shrimp cr&#234;pes entr&#233;e to contain more than two shrimp. Figure in $10 house margaritas and you're looking at a splurge that may keep Chicagoans within the city limits.","Vegetarian-friendly","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Oak Brook, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Suburbs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lunch, dinner (closed Sun)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2820","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","20 E 1st St,","Salbute (CLOSED)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","630-920-8077","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mexican","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","60521","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$$","Salbute (CLOSED)","","","Yes","","","","","27","Suburbs","","","","S","","","","","","salbute.com",""

For dessert, you'll want to go equally simple: The Brooklyn Blackout isn't very complex, but it's one of the only desserts on the menu without an off-putting gimmick.","Notable wine listPrivate party room(s)SuburbanGood for dining at bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Wheeling, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Suburbs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dinner","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3027","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","601 N Milwaukee Ave,","Tramonto Steak & Seafood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","847-777-6575","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Steakhouses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","60090-3023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$$$","Tramonto Steak & Seafood","","","","","","","","27","Suburbs","","","","T","","","","125","","www.westin.com/northshore",""

The housemade sauce incorporates canned tomatoes, but they're high quality and taste fresh and bright, not tinny and overly sweet.

For an entr&#233;e, the ground boar wrapped in bacon is a flavorful blend of both wild and domestic porkers.

But this new Middle Eastern stand makes its own perfectly spiced beef-and-lamb shawarma and then lets you top it off with your choice of impeccably fresh condiments: uncommonly smooth toum (garlic spread), cooling mint yogurt and a chunky Armenian tomato-and-onion salsa. But get it while you can: The concept of this stand changes every six weeks, so it will soon switch to Indian flavors, then Chinese.

Of the latter, the massive portion of hummus is a garlic-lovers dream, and of the burgers, surprisingly, it's the veggie version that takes best in show. Loaded with black beans, fresh corn, cauliflower, roasted red peppers and eggplant, it's a great match for a yeasty Bam Bi&#232;re from Jolly Pumpkin.

And though we hate to state the expected, we have to admit it: This place is pretty damn lovely. From cakey, star-shaped muffins to flaky pain au chocolat, the pastries are just as sweet and delicious as they should be. And their brownies? Tinged with cr&#232;me fra&#238;che and dark chocolate, they are some of the most serious and decadent we've ever had the pleasure of savoring. The homey shop also sports a small selection of baking-inspired gifts.

The space is tiny and somewhat cramped, the service is lackadaisical and sometimes entire sections of the menu are inexplicably unavailable. Yet, somehow, the pizza seems to make up for it. The rectangular slices (which arrive cut up into bite-size squares) have a buttery crust that's crisp on the bottom but otherwise soft and fluffy.

This fall, Foss works with a wide array of hearty, autumnal meats, such as prosciutto-wrapped boar tenderloin and a tartlet of lamb sweetbreads. He also goes crazy with foie gras, pairing it with figs in one dish, apples in another and quail in a third.

"","","","","","","Naperville is getting some buzz with this new contemporary tapas spot. Chef John Borras did some training at Spain's legendary El Bulli, and chef de cuisine Jose Marcial is an O.G. on the local tapas scene. Together, the two are mostly successful. Mango &#34;caviar&#34; and skinless ravioli filled with chocolate or squid ink are both interesting and delicious, but chocolate-covered shrimp and a marshmallow&#8211;Manchego cheese napoleon have more &#34;hmm&#34; than &#34;mmm&#34; going for them.

It's not a bad idea, but the experience can be fairly erratic: For every good move that Nia's kitchen makes (a lovely trio of Mediterranean sausages, including a tender, housemade loukanika), there seems to be an equally bad one (piquillo peppers stuffed with chewy braised oxtail).

"","","","","","","A string of Middle Eastern restaurants has called this space home, but none has been quite as polished or solid as this. That can probably be chalked up to owner Intranig Lieon, who spent years on the management side of Reza's and Mambo Grill and obviously knows how to run a restaurant. The name refers to the kebabs, which are skewered and grilled to order; the kefta (ground beef) is particularly juicy. But the really good stuff is the meze: Tart and spicy pickled vegetables; thick, tahini-rich hummus; and a cool, cucumber-studded tzatziki, all of which are good enough that the skewers become an afterthought.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chicago, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lincoln Square","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lunch, dinner","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4316","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4609 N Lincoln Ave","Skewers (CLOSED)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","773-293-0300","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Middle Eastern","","El: Brown to Western.

And while this dining room might not inspire as much awe as the building's grand lobby, it nevertheless feels stately and old-school (and sometimes just plain old). We thought maybe this place would be running on history alone, but the food was surprisingly solid: Shrimp was perfectly juicy (which is good since it's in every single appetizer), tournedos of beef were tender enough not to require a knife, and the trout was finished with a sprightly lemon-caper sauce.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chicago, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Edgewater","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brunch (Sun), dinner (Tue&#8211;Sat)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4406","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5545 N Sheridan Rd","Edgewater Beach Caf&#233;","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","773-275-4141","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Classic American","French","El: Red to Bryn Mawr.

"","","","","","","The old-school (and awesome) sign and awning date back to this staple's midcentury debut, but the recently remodeled interior is brand-spanking new. In an apparent attempt to remind hungry Chinatown wanderers this is still a viable option, the owners have created a very comfortable setting, replete with lacquered black tables and romantic dimmed lighting. The menu happily remains old-school Cantonese, with specialties like crispy shrimp roll, sizzling rice seafood soup and kung pao chicken. Some items (such as the ying yang shrimp) are a bit sweet for our taste, but can be countered with the ultratart house specialty&#8212;mai tais.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chicago, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chinatown","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lunch, dinner","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4442","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","204 W Cermak Rd","Cantonesia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","312-225-0100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chinese","","El: Red to Cermak-Chinatown.

Order at least half a bird per person&#8212;the chicken is so juicy, with such delicious charred skin, that a quarter just won't cut it. The tendency at these Mexican chicken joints is to eat the chicken with soft pita. We aren't discouraging that practice, but if you're heading here on the weekends, when they serve housemade tortillas, concocting tacos and topping them with the fiery salsa (whose flames can be put out by the rich, creamy frijoles) is the more authentic way to go.","Cheap (entrees under $10)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chicago, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yes","","Northwest Side","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lunch, dinner","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4443","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3652 W Lawrence Ave","Chuy's Chicken","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","773-267-3377","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mexican","","El: Brown to Kimball.

It might no longer be a forward-thinking restaurant, but if it can survive where Shochu couldn't, then it's probably what the neighborhood wants.","Late-night diningGood for dining at barGood for groupsOutdoor seating","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chicago, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lakeview","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dinner","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4484","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3313 N Clark St","Deleece Grill Pub","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","773-348-3313","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average small plate: $8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Classic American","","El: Brown, Purple (rush hrs), Red to Belmont.

Where the place falters is in some of its execution. While the turkey burger is moist and the onion rings perfect, the beef can be gristly and tough and the veggie burger mushy.

"","","","","","","If Colombian restaurants are only as good as the music they play (and if you ask the owner of one, that's what he or she will tell you), this corner spot has a chance at greatness: Expert guitar stylings come from either the flat-screen in the front dining room or, on Fridays and Saturdays, from a live band in the back. Empanadas filled with tender steak make a good nosh for watching the band (especially if you put some chimichurri on them), and so does the sobrebarriga a la criolla, which is more of that grilled steak flanked by sweet plantains. But the picada grande, a platter of deep-fried ribs, fried sausage, fried beef and fried yucca? Let's just say it's a little discordant.

Some of them, like ridiculously flavorful chicken thighs with gorgonzola polenta, are quite good. But for every successful comfort food dish pulled off (spicy lamb, lobster-enhanced brandade), there's a &#34;creative&#34; dish (potato chip&#8211;coated skate wing, tempura-fried sushi) that falls flat.

"","","","","","","African restaurants are well known for their leisurely pace, but here the mother-and-son team behind Bolat go the exact opposite route: Customers place their orders at a counter, get in line at a buffet and watch as their food goes from steam table to plate in a matter of minutes. Technically, that makes this stuff fast food, but the flavors are clearly the result of slow cooking. Goat meat has seemingly endless layers of hot and mild peppers; peanut soup has that nut's savory edge but also a peppery bite; and jerk chicken is cloaked in a sauce redolent with cardamom and cloves. The through line is the heat, which can sometimes be absolutely tongue-scorching. Order a soft, starchy yam fufu to give your tongue a break.","Cheap (entrees under $10)Vegetarian-friendly","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chicago, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Uptown","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mon&#8211;Sat 7am&#8211;9pm; Sun 11am&#8211;7pm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5208","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4623 N Broadway","Iyanze","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","773-944-1417","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","African","","El: Red to Wilson.

Turns out the owners of this tiny carryout joint bought the recipes from one &#34;Miss Ruby,&#34; who had a similar Memphis operation since, well, 1955. We're assuming to survive in the barbecue belt of Tennessee Ruby's recipes were executed with smokers, but here in Chicago, the slow-baked method yields results more akin to homestyle cooking than competition 'cue. Ribs are tender and peppery while pulled pork is juicy (but a bit stringy).

But when it comes to the signature maki, the focus is more on crazy sauces and combinations than on the fish itself. The mango sauce on the Dark Knight Roll, along with mango in the roll, is so overpowering there may as well not be any tuna in it; the intriguing BLT roll doesn't offer much beyond bacon. Still, with solid basics and incredibly friendly service, it's worth keeping a menu around for delivery.

"","","","","","","After 40 years of slinging kosher fish out of his seafood shop Good Morgan, Aharon Morgan expanded next door and gave chef Erik Williams (Volo, BIN 36) the license to do what's yet to be done on Devon: contemporary kosher. Lightly seared escolar, a buttery super white tuna, is set off by an awesome combo of citrus, shaved fennel and ginger. For a main course, escolar pops up again, this time slathered in miso that caramelizes to a crust on a cedar plank over the grill. A &#34;hot slaw&#34; of braised cabbage and fennel adds that little something extra, just as the mango chutney does for eggplant hush puppies and plump shiitake do for the otherwise standard miso soup. The place would benefit from a little more atmosphere (entr&#233;es in the low $20s need music and dimmer lighting), but that minor quibble doesn't change the fact that you can't kosher food this good anywhere else.

Whichever route you choose there will be hits and misses, but if you start with a cocktail (all of them are solid) and end with the warm and fragrant New England Indian pudding, it'll be easy to forgive any bumps in the road.","Notable wine listGood for dining at barKid-friendlyFireplace","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chicago, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lakeview","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Brunch (Sun), dinner (Wed&#8211;Sun)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5630","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3819 N Broadway","Hearty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","773-244-9866","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Classic American","","El: Red to Sheridan.

Sushi Taiyo, from the owners of Rise and Shine Morida, manages to stand out with terrible-sounding, yet surprisingly delicious, maki like the Kinomi: white fatty tuna and avocado topped with a plump raspberry and raspberry reduction.

If you're a fan of anything fat, fried and creamed, though, almost everything here will make sense: Cabbage is shaped into a patty and deeply fried; tender, fatty short ribs are topped with a dollop of goat-cheese cream; and mashed potatoes are stuffed inside thin, delicate dough for classic pierogi.

Here, pozole virgins can try the full spectrum of roja, verde and blanco and determine just which way they swing. Blanco is as basic as it gets (read: a bit boring), while the rojo brings a bit more heat thanks to rusty-red guajillo chiles. Our favorite, the verde, balances the toasty nuttiness of ground pepitas (hulled pumpkin seeds) with bright notes of tomatillos and just-fatty-enough bits of pork for a bowl much more memorable than its canned-pea color would suggest.

Because while the sushi is just okay, the tender and juicy bulgogi is surprisingly good.","BYOB","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chicago, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lakeview","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dinner (closed Wed)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6962","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2936 N Broadway","Hiro's Cafe","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","773-477-8510","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Japanese/sushi","Korean","Bus: 22, 36, 76","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","60657","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","$","Hiro's Cafe","","","","","","","","9","Lakeview","","","","H","","","","","","",""
"","","","","","","The menu at this sprawling, festive Mexican joint is comprised of page after page of enchiladas, fajitas and nachos.

"","","","","","","The team behind the Merlo mini empire has added a third to the family, this one decidedly downscale with mismatched plates, wooden tables topped with rustic runners and a menu of trattoria staples, many hailing from the family's hometown of Bologna. Tender, chilled rabbit meat on crostini and yellow fin house-cured in EVOO are a good start, and housemade pastas are simple yet tasty (after a request for the salt shaker). The accolades belong to the braised chicken legs in a forest's worth of 'shrooms and the tremendous desserts, including a rice pudding cake studded with candied citrus and Amaretti cookies.","Vegetarian-friendlyPrivate party room(s)Notable wine listGood for dining at bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Chicago, IL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lincoln Park","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dinner","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","6966","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1967 N Halsted St","La Trattoria de Merlo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","312-951-8200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Average main course: $16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Italian/pizza","","El: Brown, Purple (rush hrs) to Armitage.
